18	Ben Simmons &amp; The 76ers: A Threat to a Dynasty	"Taken and reformatted from original post [here](https://theunderhand.com/ben-simmons-threat-dynasty/)

If there's one thing that NBA fans worldwide can (hopefully) agree upon, it's that Ben Simmons' first season in the league was nothing short of fantastic.

After being selected first overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, and further missing that full season due to injury, Simmons debuted this season and dominated, averaging 15.8ppg, 8.1rpg, and 8.2apg. Take into account that he did all this without any semblance of a jumpshot within his game and it continues to impress. Regardless of whether Simmons was a ‘true’ rookie in the season past, he seems destined for a bright future in the NBA.

Simmons was the key playmaker on the young Philadelphia 76ers squad, where he led them to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, finishing with a 52-30 record. This was also their first playoffs appearance in the last 6 years – not bad for a rookie. He excelled running the team’s offense, racking up dimes across the season for a total of 661 – good for 3rd place in the entire NBA. He was comfortable in his game all-around, getting his boards and points to respectable tallies. For a long while, it seemed as though ‘The Process’ was complete.


**Exposure in the Playoffs**

Simmons and the 76ers were, however, exposed in the semi-finals of the playoffs by their newfound Eastern Conference rival – the Boston Celtics. They did what many teams had tried to do all year, and found a way to semi-stifle Ben Simmons’ offensive game with what is possibly the simplest tactic of all time. They gave him space. And when I say they gave him space, I mean they gave him SPACE, which inevitably led to THIS.

https://imgur.com/a/5D1uxuI

I can’t remember a time when any NBA team disrespected a player on defence in such a way since the[ Spurs played Hack-a-Shaq 5 seconds into the 2008 season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_soY5Jg_Q). Even then, that was a joke by Popovich.

[As you can see in ESPN's stats](https://imgur.com/a/TqrBt5h), during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Simmons was held to only 1 point. It's nothing to be entirely worried about, although it's definitely worth noting. This was his first season in the league, and his first true exposure to high-stakes competition, something he didn't reach at LSU. To expect a rookie to have to carry teams with 30+ point performances night-in-night-out shows how much we, as viewers, have become acclimatised to the ability of the likes of LeBron James.

[In this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/97g7ae/oc_worst_playoff_performances_by_notable_rookies/), it's evident that many notable rookies experience similar struggles at some point. Even the Celtics' Tatum had a 4pt game this year; see also, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony circa. 2004.

[Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJdHh9a1Ok) at how Simmons scored his 16 points, though, in Game 3 - immediately following his 1pt performance:

* A mismatch in the post, where he's now 1-on-1 against Rozier (an 8 inch advantage). He goes around him and finishes.
* Goes around Morris who is slow off reading a screen and finishes with a right-hand layup just in front of Horford.
* Finishes around Ojeleye in transition.
* Comes around a screen from Embiid and fakes out Baynes, finishing with an awkward floater/layup on his right.
* Lob on transition from Reddick.
* Hits an exceptionally awkward looking left-handed fadeaway over Horford in the paint.
* Hesitates and pull-ups for a fade in the paint.
* Spins around his defender for a layup.

It's worth noting that Boston didn't give him quite as much space as in Game 2. Compare that to [THIS play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=58&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU) during Game 2.

Horford immediately drops deep and allows Simmons space. Yes, he does get the pass off to Saric who drains the shot - but the principle is right. In fact, if you keep watching the video, you'll see just how effective Boston's tactics were; cutting passing lanes, allowing Simmons space, spying on movement, and doubling down low.

This isn’t to say that it’s a make or break situation for Philly; Ben Simmons, regardless of whether he’s given space or not has shown that he is capable of getting to the rim and finishing – particularly from broken play. He also has phenomenal court vision, and an ability to find any open man as soon as they lace up and step on the court. You see, it's not that Ben Simmons is able to be completely nullified and will never score points again; **it's that Boston managed to find a way that neutralises many of his half-court threats, and this impacts heavily on the structure and flow of the 76ers' offense.**

**The Boston Defence**

Stopping Simmons using the style of defence applied by the Celtics also requires a very versatile, switchable defensive scheme, and an effective set of players – something that few teams in the league have at their disposal. [Boston defends in a very similar manner to Golden State](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/15/boston-celtics-switching-defense-pays-dividends-2018-playoffs) – a heavy usage of switching. When you look at the Celtics squad, they have a group of interchangeable wings that can easily switch assignment without having to face too much of a deficit, plus the access of a premier defender in Marcus Smart. Al Horford is also crucial in this regard, as his pure ability to read the defense and play smart basketball is what gives the Celtics an edge. To top it all off, you have by far one of the best coaches in the league in Brad Stevens, who reads the game unlike many others. Stevens actually said that [he runs a more ‘position-less’ squad](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720250-brad-stevens-says-celtics-have-3-not-5-positions-now), which is what helps the effectiveness of this system. With the use of ‘ball-handlers’, ‘wings’, and ‘bigs’, there is room for interchange.

Here's a look at how the Celtics could line-up this coming season.

First Unit:
* Ball Handler - Kyrie Irving

* Wing - Jaylen Brown

* Wing - Jayson Tatum

* Wing - Gordon Hayward

* Big - Al Horford

Bench unit:
* Ball Handler - Terry Rozier

* Wing - Marcus Smart

* Wing - Semi Ojeleye

* Wing - Marcus Morris

* Big - Aron Baynes

That's a REALLY versatile defensive lineup.

What I would expect to see from other less-capable defensive teams is the key lessons more so than the specific scheme – give him space, cut passing lanes, and limit transition opportunities. Now evidently Simmons' teammates will still have a good chance of hitting their shots; they're professional basketballers playing in the best league in the world. But, this strategy is about limiting their effectiveness, Simmons' distribution, and disrupting the offense.

Something to really consider is that[ Simmons averaged the second-most offensive touches during the 2017-18 regular season](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612755), losing to only Russell Westbrook. Simmons’ 95.0 touches per game increase to 104.6 touches during the 76ers playoff run, almost 6 more touches than LeBron per game, and more than Westbrook.

When you take into account such a high volume of touches, it’s clear that he truly is the core facilitator in the Philadelphia squad – the next highest was Embiid at 76.4 (76.6 in the playoffs). This is also the core of the issue. If your main facilitator is unable to play his normal style of game, get passes to the right place, get his shots off, and the opposition is able to spy on offensive movement, your team won’t run as well as it should. Simmons is essentially unable to adapt his game to the Boston defense, due to the fact that he can’t generate any respect as a shooting threat.

**Simmons and Shooting**

Similarly, Simmons cannot be relied upon to drain high-percentage looks down the stretch. Even if Simmons were to remain on the court during clutch situations, and acted as the primary ball-handler, his odds of getting a successful go-ahead bucket are limited. Switch this idea, having Simmons on the court but not handling the ball, and you simply have one less player that the defense has to worry about on a catch-and-shoot situation, meaning that they are able to better focus their defensive energies to threats.

[Look again at this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=255&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU). Late in the fourth-quarter, Simmons really can't do much to help the team in this situation as the main playmaker. Embiid ends up pulling up from three, and Saric gets the second-chance points.

Yes, you could play Simmons down on the low-block in these situations as a lob threat and crashing the offensive glass – but that’s a bit insulting to your players with the league-high touches per game, no? Regardless, Simmons' low-post game is nowhere near developed enough to be a respectable threat - unless it's a mismatch (see the Rozier mismatch above), and his off-ball movement is generally above Westbrook-level, but not enough to create a huge threat.

Another potential threat to the Sixers is the prospect of Hack-a-Simmons. During the regular season, he shot **56% on 4.2 attempts/game**. Although this increased to 70% during the playoffs on a much smaller sample size, the question remains: Do you risk keeping on your main offensive threat in these late-game situations, when:

* He’s a risk of being sent to the line?
* He’s clearly struggling to generate points in a half-court offense?
* You’re facing a team with a good interior defender, and a switch-heavy defense, allowing him space and negating part of the offensive flow?

Let’s take a theoretical situation where Philly decides to take Simmons OUT of the lineup during the final three minutes of a playoff game. You’re now missing the remainder of Simmons’ 104 touches, and they have to be moved somewhere. Therefore, one of your other players has to step in and run the offense. The natural solution is either:

1. The reserve PG (T.J. McConnell) steps in and runs it as per previously
2. ISO every play with your most efficient scorer (Embiid - 0.82pts per ISO possession, on 1.6 possessions per game).

The first option is much less intimidating to the defensive team; no disrespect to T.J. McConnell (for whom I have a huge soft spot), but his playmaking is below-par in comparison to Simmons. The second option, as scary as it may seem, is not justifiable for long-stretches of game time. Embiid is a great scorer, but against a good defensive centre, not only is he going to get tired, but defenders will adapt.

Simply said, Ben Simmons NEEDS to develop some form of a shooting stroke. At the very minimum, a respectable FT percentage to allow him to stay on the court during late-game situations. If he doesn’t do so, then the 76ers need an adequate replacement.

**Wrong Hand Woes**

On the topic of Simmons’ shooting, Kevin O’Connor (Writer for The Ringer - shoutout u/KevinOConnorNBA love your work and hope you enjoy this), is ADAMANT that he uses the wrong hand for shooting.

In a recent interview with Fox Sports, Simmons was asked about whether even he knows which hand of his is more dominant, to which he replied, “You come to the gym. I’m gonna work out when I’m in Melbourne. You’ll see.” As cryptic as that may be, he continued when prodded to say, “In the NBA you’ve gotta play to what your strengths are. I never had real chances of just shooting. I never played in a year where I had to develop my shooting, because I was always better than most of the guys I played. Even this season without the jumper I was able to nearly have a triple-double every game.”

On the topic of whether developing shooting will be something he looks into in the near future, he said, “It just depends where I wanna be later in life. I can be satisfied with 15/8/8, or if I wanna be at that next level and be an all-star, then I add something to my game.”

[Here's Simmons hitting a nice-looking right-hand hook shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUN4rYSekYg)

In comparison, [here's a shot Simmons took left-handed during a pre-season workout.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&amp;v=ihyFtqYng5s)

See the difference? Nobody knows for sure, but it's something Simmons himself needs to establish.

**The Impact of Respect**

To wrap this all up, let’s take a look at what the Boston defence may look like should Simmons develop some form of shooting stroke.

If Ben Simmons would even attempt proper three-pointers during games, you may find that the space between himself and a defender like Horford may slowly shrink. Hell, even Marcus Smart, arguably one of the worst decent-volume shooters in the league, is taking open threes, shooting at a measly 29.3% career clip - at 4.2 attempts per game.

Below are some edited glimpses into how the defense could look if Simmons' developed any resemblance to a perimeter threat - taken from the original image above.

https://imgur.com/a/m4MXcbx
3pt% = 15-20

https://imgur.com/a/ETAkBoG
3pt% = 25

https://imgur.com/a/9AUT2VJ
3pt% = 30

This seemingly insignificant increase in space, caused by the increased respect for Simmons' genuine threat of a half-decent jumpshot changes the entire dynamic of the defense that the 76ers will face.

**Conclusion**

To reiterate, the downside is that the teams capable of providing such a defensive impact are few and far between in the current NBA, as it requires such a diverse lineup and widespread talent, plus solid coaching. During the regular season, there is also MUCH less time for these teams to focus on implementing defensive game-plans simply for one team; it’s during the coming playoffs that we’ll largely see whether franchises choose to adapt to such a style, and if so, then personally I find it hard to see Philly going too much further than this season without a solid replacement and/or third-scoring option (looking at you Fultz).

Regardless, I believe that this coming season we’ll see Ben Simmons still have a great follow-up to his rookie year – at least statistically. He’s evidently one of the most talented offensive players that the league has seen, with an unreal feel and read of the game. Will the Sixers manage to make it through a balanced eastern conference this year, with a strong Celtics squad and defensively-improved Raptors, amongst others? That remains to be seen."	nba
19	Thon Maker reportedly got 10 pounds of muscle this offseason after putting on 8 pounds of muscle the previous one. Which puts him at ... 233 lbs.	"Rookie Thon was 215 lbs, sophomore Thon was 223 lbs and 3rd year Thon will be around 233 lbs.

This puts into perspective just how much of a skeleton 7'1"" 215 lbs is. Even after putting on 18 lbs he is still very thin. 

And he'll probably need at least 2-3 more years to reach 250 lbs. KG and Duncan who were thin Centers (and 6'11"", not 7'1"") weighed between 250-255 lbs."	nba

After seeing all the news circulating about WNBA players complaining about low compensation, I decided to give the game a chance. I’m a Seattle native and was aware that the storm were playing the mercury for a winner take all game 5, and decided to tune in.
This game ended up being one of the more exciting games I’ve seen all year, including the NBA and college basketball. Sue bird absolutely took over the 4th quarter and looked unconscious draining three after three from all over the court. The game didn’t lack any excitement, and I’ve gotta say, these women know how to play basketball. Their ball movement and understanding of the game is on par with some of the better teams in the NBA. The only knock I could see was the lack of athleticism (dunks), but that didn’t bother me since the game was such a close match and had clutch performances by players on both teams. 
After today I’ll definitely be tuning in to the WNBA finals to root for my storm. You guys should check one of the games out as well, you might end up liking it a lot. If you end up not enjoying it, than at least now you know. Don’t hate on these women though until you’ve actually given their game a chance."	nba

He’s a 5 time all star, Five time all NBA team, five time all defensive team. The inaugural defensive player of the year and  oh yeah won it back to back in era that contained Kareem, magic, and isiah Thomas.  Even Michael Jordan said that he was the only player who could guard him. But he is still not in the hall of fame while other players who have had less of an impact have made it in.

30	Non Cherry-Picked Stat: Of players last season with at least 10 games played, stats of at least 62 TS%, 22 AST% and 1.7 STL% where recorded by just 3 players. Lebron James, Stephen Curry and Joe Ingles.	"http://bkref.com/tiny/7mOzk  
  
This non biased stat represents a couple of things.  
  
The strengths of these players are that they are able to score efficiently. A 62% TS was important because you wouldn’t want an inefficient chucker like James Harden, with a TS% of 61.9 making the list.  
  
It also illustrates an ability to play well defensively by reading passing lanes, intercepting well and being strong one on one or with weak side defence. 1.7% was the limit as poor defenders Mike Conley (1.6) and Clint Capela (1.4) could have snuck in otherwise.  
  
Finally an assist percentage was used to demonstrate that this player is unselfish and a strong playmaker. Someone you would want to have on your team. I decided on 22% as the limit as you wouldn’t value selfish ball hogs like Victor Oladipo (21.2%) and Jimmy Butler (20.6%)

So as you can see, not cherry picked at all."	nba

Before he was chosen by the Hornets, the 17-year-old Bryant had made a lasting impression on then-Lakers general manager Jerry West, who immediately foresaw potential in Bryant's basketball ability during pre-draft workouts. West even went on to state that Bryant's workouts were some of the best he had seen. Immediately after the draft, Dave Cowens expressed that the Hornets had no use for him. Fifteen days later, West traded his starting center, Vlade Divac to the Hornets for the young Kobe Bryant.

39	Here's why the Orlando Magic are the true heirs to the Eastern Conference throne	"Everyone remembers how good the Magic were for the first 12 games of the 17-18 season, going 8-4 with absurdly incomprehensible statistics that seemed to defy the laws of nature itself. They didn't go, uh, as well for the rest of the season, but it is clear to see that this hugely disrespected team is more than its final record would suggest. Here's why the Orlando Magic are the real successors to LeBron's dynasty:

\-Losing Shelvin ""Dishing Dimes"" Mack and his 3.9 assists per game isn't ideal, but the true solution can be found in Point Gordon. This could be the season where Air Gordon becomes the Magic's true playmaker, and if you watch his highlights ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s)), he has the vision to make it work. If only he had the foresight to see that using a drone in a dunk contest isn't as good as jumping over a KIA ™ automobile.

\-Mo ""Long Boi"" Bamba is not only a solid shooter and shotblocker, but he had a rap song named after him BEFORE he even made it to the NBA! Plus Sheck Wes was really catchy on No Bystanders and his adlibs are pure heat, so I'll give Mo props by default.

\-They traded for Timofey ""Solid contributor to a title-winning team"" Mozgov. Yes, THE Mosgov that exploded for the best NBA game in history ([https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg)) with a whopping 93 points and 29 rebounds. If you can find a more dominant big man, then you're probably watching old Wilt tapes.

With solid contributors like Nikola ""He's an All-Star if teams were selected after 4 games"" Vucevic and Evan ""Don't Google his last name"" Fournier, as well as Jonathan ""KD if his elite scoring was actually elite defence"" Isaac, these players aren't to be underestimated.

Was there any reason for this? Was it just a coincidence, with a lot of players improving at the same time? Was it because pretty much every team in the league had its own star this season? Was it due to pace or something? I'm just amazed how THIS many star players had career seasons."	nba

89	San Antonio Spurs sign Chimezie Metu		nba
90	What’s the greatest stat line put up by a guard?	"There’s been a lot of good individual performances coming from guards especially in the past 3 seasons.
Guards like Harden, Russ, Curry always have at least one crazy game."	nba
91	BJ Armstrong on MJ: “He would never tell you he lost, he either won, or he learned.” [Nike Instagram]		nba
92	Stephen Curry longevity	Stephen Curry is in his 30’s now, do you think his game will begin to deteriorate or will he be dominating for a long time due to his 3 point shot and handles?	nba
93	How is the NBA associated with the WNBA? Does the NBA own it, or just support and promote it?	I always see the NBA promoting the WNBA on social media and stuff and just wants to know how literally connected they actually are. Is the WNBA completely separate and the NBA just does them a solid and promotes them? How does it work? 	nba
94	What's the most disrespectful comment you have seen on this sub?	"Mine was when a raptors fan told someone on here with a SEA flair that ""your team doesn't even exist"" which led to this atomic bomb of a clap back

""Well........neither does yours when the playoffs come around"""	nba
95	"The flashiest playmakers according to NBA's official ""Top 100 Plays: 2018 Season"""	"Hey all! If you missed it, the NBA released their official [top 100 plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQ4oTKQw3o) video a couple of days ago, and I thought it could be cool to see which players had the most highlighted plays, as it's sorta of a proxy for who the NBA considered their flashiest players last season. 

**Overall Standings**: I'm counting any direct involvement in the positive side of the play - hockey assist, assist, scoring, blocking a shot, getting the steal to set up a fast break, etc. Getting dunked on doesn't count, and setting up the play outside of the highlight shown doesn't count. When players traded buzzer beaters I counted both. With no further ado:

(1) LeBron James: 14

(2) Anthony Davis: 7

(3) Ben Simmons: 6

(4) Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5

(T-5) Larry Nance Jr: 4

(T-5) Russell Westbrook: 4

(T-7) Joel Embiid: 3

(T-7) James Harden: 3

(T-7) Kyrie Irving: 3

(T-7) Khris Middleton: 3

(T-7) Terry Rozier: 3

(T-12) Carmelo Anthony: 2

(T-12) Kevin Durant: 2

(T-12) Jerami Grant: 2

(T-12) Gary Harris: 2

(T-12) Damian Lillard: 2

(T-12) Darius Miller: 2

**Notable Snubs:** These are the All-NBA/Defensive Team/All Stars who had no featured highlights: Aldridge, Beal, Covington, Curry, Cousins, Dragic, Gobert, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Horford, Love, Lowry, Dejounte Murray, Klay Thompson, and Towns.

More than half of the All Rookie Team actually made it, which is pretty darn impressive. Simmons, Mitchell, Tatum, Smith Jr, Collins, and Jackson all appear in this compilation, while Kuzma, Markkanen, Ball, and Bogdanovic do not (though Ball, Markkanen, and Kuzma do appear getting posterized).


**Team Wide Results**: Most total team highlights goes, unsurprisingly, to the Cavaliers. When LeBron already makes up 14% of the list, it's not hard to think that this is going to end up happening. Nance adds 3, JR Smith adds 2, and Hill, Green, Osman, and Zizic each add 1 for a total of 23 highlights (with some double dipping).

The most total players from one team, rather than just highlights, was a tie. The Cavs had the 7 players above appear, but the other team was more surprising - the Suns. Although none of their players had multiple highlights, Booker, Chriss, Ulis, Jackson, Len, Chandler, and Bender all appear once.

The Pistons, Wizards, Kings, Bulls, Hawks, Magic, Spurs, and Clippers each have only 1 highlighted play. About 1/4 of the teams in the league are represented by 8% of the plays in this video.

The Bulls, Wizards, Magic, and Kings all had only one player appear in a highlight. The other teams with only one highlights feature multiple players.

Interestingly, the only Warriors to make the video are Livingston (the crossover on Harden) and Durant (a great block and the clutch long shot in the finals). The NBA champs only had 3 total highlights, and none included a pass or assist. 4 of the 11 snubbed All Stars are on the Warriors 2018-19 roster, and the only 2 starters in the All Star Game are both on the Warriors roster. Maybe parity exists after all /s"	nba

102	What is the best starting lineup you could put on the floor using any five players that ever have played in the league?	"Players can be from any era and are in the prime of their career (unless stated otherwise). This is more so me pondering the best team you could put together and not asking the best five players ever. Won’t take personal chemistry/ability to get along into account and the team would play with the rules of today’s NBA. 

My lineup:

-PG: John Stockton 
-SG: Michael Jordan 
-SF: LeBron James 
-PF: Kevin Durant 
-C: Hakeem Olajuwon 

-Offense: Stockton pick and rolls/pops with LeBron, Durant, and Hakeem would be nearly unstoppable. If LeBron runs the offense Stockton is capable of hitting shots from behind the arc. Jordan and Durant can score at will giving the three others plenty of open looks. 

-Defense: This is where Stockton and Hakeem earn their spot. Can you imagine being glad you aren’t being guarded by Jordan only to get locked up and stripped by Stockton? Hakeem stops dominate low post scorers from taking over and is quick enough to switch up to most 3s. Not to mention if LeBron actually tries he can be an amazing defender given his IQ and athleticism. "	nba
103	Which Eastern team has the best bench?	I have yet to see a consistent answer to this question and I've always thought that the Pacers bench has gotten much much better and is able to enter the discussion for one of the best bench units in the east. Who do y'all have as your top 4 eastern bench units?	nba
104	[Dinwiddie] is worried.		nba
105	NBA Front Office Salaries	Does anybody know the approximate salary breakdown of an NBA team’s front office? For instance, I know that GMs typically earn in the low-to-mid 7 figure range (with top execs like Ainge, Riley, Buford, or Myers potentially pushing 8 figures per year), but I’m curious about the other positions (i.e. Director of Analytics, Director of Scouting, Director of Player Development, etc). Thought some of you may know!	nba
106	Can anyone explain to me the origin story of why Charles Barkley hates Skip Bayless so much?	I saw a recommended video on YouTube where it talks about Chuck’s dying wish is to kill Skip, and another video saying he wants to put a foot up his ass. I’m just wondering when and why is this a thing?	nba
107	Who will be the next player to average triple double?	If we don't count Westbrook, is there any other player in upcoming seasons that can achieve at least 10/10/10 on average? 	nba
108	"Kobe talking about Manu in Kobe Doin' Work: ""That's a bad boy right there. I have so much respect for his game. He's an incredible competitor. It's a shame he didn't play in this ball game. I enjoy playing against him. Fantastic two guard."""		nba

110	In his last 16 games, Brandon Ingram averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists with a 59.0 TS% in 32.7 minutes per game	"In 7 of those 16 games, he started at the point guard position in the absence of Lonzo Ball, where he averaged 19.6 points, 5.6 assists and 3.7 rebounds with a TS% of 62.2% in 34.3 minutes per game.

Another interesting thing to note is that Ingram was able to shoot 48.6% from 3 in those 16 games on 2.2 attempts per game. That is a good sign for the Lakers as with LeBron coming in he will need to attempt more 3s than he has before to reach his peak effectiveness, and this shows he could be able to do it on well above average efficiency.

Ingram had only just turned 21 yesterday so he still has a lot of room to improve upon his stellar form in the last quarter of his season and may be able to become a very reliable secondary option for a LeBron-led Lakers squad in the coming years."	nba

next 5 seasons - 24.6%

Obviously Iverson's conditioning isn't in question, he had the best endurance of any player drafted after the 50s, but isn't it unusual for a player drafted as a PG to not improve the two most important PG skills over the course of a long career?"	nba
116	Are there any all stars in the last 25 years who wouldn't survive in today's NBA due to the game change	"Today's NBA is very different from just a decade ago, with its heavy emphasis on outside shooting and playmaking. I have been thinking if there were any players in the past 25 years whose skillsets made them all stars but will be marginalized or even extinct in today's NBA? 

The one guy came to mind is Jamaal Magloire. He's probably one of the worst all stars ever, but he was productive as a player with 14 years of experience. But in today's NBA, I honestly feel he would not get drafted in the first round, and will be out of the league in less than two years. We just don't see that type of slow post player anymore.

Anyone else come to mind?"	nba

I’ll start:

Kawhi Leonard is an amazing player but he gets so much credit from one series(Memphis 16-17). One series doesn’t really do much imo. He’s still top 5 tho


AD isn’t a top 5 player right now.

Steven Adams is massively overrated on this sub mostly because he’s likeable and says mate a lot.

A lot of all stars today are better than majority of all stars in the past era 

Warriors didn’t ruin the NBA. They made it more exciting. We have teams who can harm them now: mostly Rockets and Celtics/Raptors.

Pacers will got to the ECF

JR Smith is actually a very good player

Carmelo is still decent(not a very hot take)

130	How would Rick Barry fare in today's NBA?	I was watching some old NBA videos and Rick Barry caught my attention. He had a really good shot and his passing ability was good too. He had good dribbling with the carry rules back then. How do you think he would have done today? I can't really say because I've only watched a few videos on youtube.	nba
131	Scottie Pippen Refuses to Enter in the final moments of a Playoff Game	On May 13, 1994, the Chicago Bulls were playing the Knicks in Game 3 of the ECSF. The Bulls had dropped the first 2 games of the series and needed a win to stay in the series. With the score tied at 102, and 1.8 seconds left in the game, Phil Jackson drew up a play for rookie Toni Kukoc. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kukoc did manage to drain a [23 foot buzzer beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NSpgbPcxoU) to stun the Knicks, though there wasn't much celebrating by the Bulls players. Cameras even caught a frowning Jackson storming off the court. The Bulls managed to take the series to 7, but Pippen's 20 points and 16 rebounds were not enough, as the Knicks coasted to an 87-77 victory. They would eventually lose to the Houston Rockets in 7 games.	nba

133	Which NBA players are most likely to respond to Twitter/IG Dms?	I've seen all these posts about KD talking to someone on Twitter and it really made me curious to see if they're other players that actively respond to fans on social media. I've honestly always wanted to talk to an NBA players one on one and I never thought that it could be as easy as just sliding in the DMs. Or maybe it's just a slow off-season for all of us.	nba

137	Oldest and Youngest Teams in NBA History	"With teams like the Phoenix Suns stockpiling young players over the last few years, it got me wondering about the youngest and oldest teams in NBA history. Here's what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

YOUNGEST TEAM: 2005-06 Atlanta Hawks-- average age of 22.7 years old. The youngest player in the rotation was rookie Marvin Williams (19) while the oldest player was Ty Lue (28). Other members included Josh Smith (20), Zaza Pachulia (21), and Joe Johnson (24). Overall, 10 players with less than 4 years of experience saw the floor that season. Their final record was 26-56. 

&amp;#x200B;

OLDEST TEAM (tied): 2000-01 Utah Jazz-- average age of 32.0 years old. The oldest player in the rotation was John Stockton (38) while the youngest was Jacque Vaughn (25). Other members included Karl Malone (37), Olden Polynice (36), and John Starks (35). Overall, 8 players over the age of 30 saw the floor that season. Their final record was 53-39, losing in the first round to young Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks.

&amp;#x200B;

OLDEST TEAM, pt. 2: 1997-98 Houston Rockets. The oldest player in the regular rotation was Eddie Johnson (38), though Charles Jones (40) also played sparingly throughout the season. Others included Clyde Drexler, Kevin Willis, and Hakeem Olajuwon (all 35) as well as Charles Barkley and Mario Elie (both 34). The youngest players in the rotation were Othella Harrington and Rodrick Rhodes (24). They finished with a 0.500 record and ironically lost to a slightly younger Malone/Stockton duo in the first round. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I doubt any team is poised to break the record for youngest this year, but that could change once the league reopens the draft for high school grads-- especially with more teams taking a ""process"" approach. "	nba
138	KD actually responded to my question		nba
139	Why are super-early-morning workouts considered to be a sign of toughness and grit in the NBA and sports in general?	"We've all seen it on social media: athletes snapping selfies and filming clips of themselves working out very early in the morning.

Why is it considered good to cut your precious nightly sleep short? 

It's NOT a good thing to force yourself to wake up way too early (and let's not kid ourselves and think these guys are going to bed at 8:30 to account for the five AM alarm clock). It's actually extremely stupid.

Cutting your sleep short is literally harmful to your body, and NBA level athletes are people who need every bit of the rest since their bodies are pretty much on a constant recovery mode. Studies have shown that only an extremely small part of the population - MJ and Kobe are good examples of these kind of physical and mental freaks - actually gets enough REM sleep by sleeping under 7,5 hours a night even though most of us think we are OK with 6 hours a night."	nba

143	Is the 2012-2013 Lakers the biggest flop in NBA History ?	Before the season started , Many experts predict the Lakers as the favorites to win the championship some even speculate they may break the bulls 72-10 record. They have 4 all stars on their team Nash, Kobe,Pau and Dwight but Injuries, Chemistry and Bad coaching held this team back so the question Is the 2012-2013 Lakers the biggest flop in NBA History ? Or is there some team who had a bigger flop maybe the 73-9 Warriors, the 03-04 Lakers or the Big 5 Nets ?	nba
144	As of right now, who do you have in the Eastern Conference playoffs?	"This is a tough one to really predict because plenty of changes can take place with rosters, injuries, etc. My predictions in no particular order are as follows:

* Boston
* Toronto
* Philadelphia
* Miami
* Milwaukee
* Indiana
* Washington
* Detroit

Dark horse candidate goes to Cleveland"	nba
145	Dan Issel is overrated	"The man led the Kentucky Colonels to a 68-16 record and lost in the first round against the NY Nets. They got annihilated by John Roche, a rookie who averaged 12 ppg in the regular season but averaged 30 ppg against the Colonels. 

Issel also choked in the playoffs every single year. He continued to lose to scrub teams like the Utah Stars in the finals and later on in Denver, he couldn't even lead his team to the playoffs until Alex English came around and saved his ass from embarrassment. Not even close to being a top 20 center in NBA history."	nba

147	Why Does No One Want Rodney Hood?	"I swear 365 days ago, people thought that Hood would break out into a scoring machine. Honestly, had Mitchell not played the way he had. Hood would've average 18+ points. I mean hell, the dude averaged 17 coming off the bench in Utah. 

He does it all on one end of the floor, 39% from deep, 45% FG%, 88% FT. And he's a perfect 3rd or 4th option for a bottom-tier playoff team. Off ball he's great, he can create his own shots, and though his passing isn't as good as it should be, he still is a top 100 player easy.

152	Kobe's 06 season is the best Scoring season since 1990.	"The only 2 players with seasons that might be close are KD in 14 and Curry in 16

Kobe 05-06 35.4 5.3 4.5 45/35/85 

Durant 13-14 32 7.4 5.5 50/39/87

Curry 15-16 30.1 5.4 6.7 50/45/91 

So kobe's efficiency is worse and it just looks like volume but he was playing in the Iso Era where league Average Ts% was .525 Kobe was at .559 ts% which is .34 % better than average 

Kobe had  50 point Games 

In 50 point games he averaged 

57.5/7/3 and he shot 54/45/90 shooting 

KD had 2 50 point games he averaged

52.7 /8/6.5 And he shot 56/57/80

Curry had 3 50 point games he averaged

51.8/6/6.2 and shot 65/61/93 

From this it looks like when Kobe went off he was very efficient but curry blows KD and Kobe out of the water with his 65/61/93 

Another thing to take into consideration is Kobe played in a slower pace pace was only at 90.1 where Durant was at 93.9 and curry was at 95.8 its currently at 97.3

So if we look at per 100 possessions 

Kobe 45.6 ppg 

Durant 41.8 

Curry 42.5 

So even if we keep everything even for them Kobe still put up more points

The most telling thing to me is Kobe scored 36% of all lakers points that's even more than Jordan's 37 ppg season where he only got 34%

Kobe 36% of team points scored

Durant 30% of team points scored 

Curry 26% of team points scored

Curry led his team to the #1 offense with Klay Thompson Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes as his starters 

Durant led his team to the #6 offense with Westbrook, Ibaka and Reggie Jackson as his starters

Kobe led his team to the #8 offense with Odom, Smush Parker, Kwame Brown and Luke Walton as his starters. 

As a matter of fact the lakers were the #3 offense with Kobe on the court vs the #30 offense with him off the court.

The final point i want to make is Kobe averaged 40+ ppg twice 

In January he averaged 43/6/4 on 47/40/90 shooting 

In April he averaged 42/6/4 on 52/41/83 shooting 

In fact Kobe from December 12th until February Kobe averaged 40/6/4 on 47/37/86 shooting

Durants best stretch is when he averaged 35ppg through 28 games without Westbrook 

Curry was pretty consistant but his best month by far  being 37 ppg on 55/53/87 shooting

So if you take all my points into consideration then i think it's pretty obvious Kobe had the best offensive season since 1990 "	nba

You could make the same scenario on this subreddit when people argue MJ vs LBJ for goat. If you have never seen MJ play, does that mean you’re opinion isn’t as valid as somebody who has witnessed both?

I can see both sides of the argument. I’m just asking to see what people think about this.

It is really quite amazing to me that no NBA player ever had chucked up 11+ threes while never hitting more than one third of his three point attempts in 4 consecutive games (in the regular season or playoffs) until James Harden did this in the last four NBA games he played. In fact, no one had ever had a streak of 4 games with 11+ threes attempted with 4 or fewer threes made in each game: http://bkref.com/tiny/JJ0tU

161	Nick Young and Cocaine Arrests, a Correlation? [OC]	"As we know, Nick Young loves cocaine, so much that he [suggested that cocaine should be legalized](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8simcz/nick_young_calls_for_the_legalization_of_cocaine/). This got me thinking, could there possibly be a correlation between the number of cocaine-related arrests and his performance that year (according to his PER). 

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a graph showing the number of cocaine-related arrests and his PER.](https://imgur.com/uVtzNfh) 

The correlation coefficient or the 'r' value is -0.703. Due to the fact that -0.703 relatively close to -1, perfect negative correlation, we can see that the two variables may be correlated. 

&amp;nbsp;

The negative correlation shows us that as the number of cocaine-related arrests increases, Nick Young's PER decreases. From this, we can draw ONLY ONE conclusion, that Nick Young performs worse when more people are arrested for cocaine, as he is directly affected by their plight affecting his performance.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, we can now see the underlying reason for Nick Young's view on the legalization of cocaine. It is not based on ethics or legal reasons, but actually, because he knows that if it is legalized and arrests go down, his performance as shown by his PER, has no limits. Thus this will enable him to become one of the best players in the NBA without the plight of his fellow cocaine lovers weighing him down.

162	Idea for 87 game NBA Season/League restructure.	"Most ideas I see about restructuring the NBA's regular season/playoff formats involve getting rid of conferences, redrawing divisional lines, weighting team's schedules with divisional play, and rewarding division winners with playoff spots as they do in the NFL. 

I don't like it. 

You still get talent disparity across the divisions. In the same way good Eastern teams benefit from the weakness of the rest of the conference, a bad division could send a mediocre team to the playoffs due to the fact that they're playing more games against inferior opponents. 

You'll still get bad teams going to the playoffs and better teams missing out. 

So here's an alternative solution. 

No conferences. 

No divisions. 

87 game season where every team plays every other team 3 times. Shorten the preseason and start everything a little earlier to fit in those 5 extra games. 

1-16 makes the playoffs. 

End of season records really show who deserves to make the playoffs because every team had the exact same strength of schedule. There's no tiebreaker scenarios because every team played each other an odd number of games. "	nba

174	LeBron could very plausibly overtake Dirk for sixth all-time in scoring when they play each other this October	"LeBron is currently 149 points behind Dirk for all-time regular season scoring. The Mavs and Lakers play for the first time on October 31, the eighth game of the season for each team. Last season, LeBron and Drik averaged 27.5 and 12.0 PPG, respectively. If they kept up this rate, LeBron would be 41 points behind Dirk going into this matchup. While it's unlikely that LeBron would outscore Dirk by 41, it's very plausible that by the time they play each other, LeBron will be well within 41 points (or possibly already ahead of Dirk by then) given that Dirk is probably declining at a faster rate (will score fewer PPG), LeBron will supposedly be playing off the ball, Dirk might miss a game or two beforehand, etc. So essentially, there's a very real chance that LeBron will overtake Dirk for the sixth all-time scoring position when they play each other in person. 

This would be really cool. It would also allow for the possibility of Dirk's regaining his spot in the same game, which would be pretty fun."	nba

177	Underrated Candidate for Greatest Game of All Time:Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals	"The 1976 NBA Finals were played between the Boston Celtics and the Phoenix Suns. The Celtics finished at the top of the East with a 54-28 record behind the stellar play of Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White. The Suns meanwhile, were the 3rd seed in the West with a 42-40 record. They upset the defending champion Golden State Warriors in 7 games in the WCF to advance to the finals. The Celtics won Games 1 and 2, but Phoenix clawed back to win Game 3 and Game 4, tying the series and setting the stage for a Game 5 at the Boston Garden. The game was pretty ordinary throughout regulation, though there was some controversy, as Paul Silas of the Celtics attempted to call a timeout near the end of regulation with the score tied 95-95. The Celtics did not have any timeouts, so this should have been a technical foul and a free throw should have been awarded to the Suns, but the referee didn't grant it. The game went into OT, where it again ended with the scores level, though there was another controversy regarding the clock, as the clock did not start when Havlicek attempted a game winning shot. The final 20 seconds of the second OT were the most notable part of the game. In those 20 seconds, here's what happened.

1.Dick Van Arsdale hit a jumper for the Suns to cut the C's lead to 1. The score was 109-108 at this point.

2. The Celtics attempted to inbound the ball to Havlicek, but Paul Westphal was there to knock it out and somehow managed to save it to Van Arsdale, who passed to Curtis Perry, who missed an 18 footer.

3. Havlicek went for the rebound, but couldn't secure it, tapping the ball back to Perry.

4. Perry drained a 15 footer to put the Suns ahead, 110-109 with just 6 seconds left.

5. Havlicek then drove into the teeth of the Phoenix defense and banked a leaning one hander off the glass to put Boston ahead as the horn sounded.

6. The Celtics fans poured onto the court to celebrate taking a 3-2 series lead and the Celtics headed back to their locker room. However, the game was not over. As Rick Barry, who was analyzing the game on CBS, pointed out, there were still 2 seconds left on the clock when the ball went through the hoop. The officials agreed, putting 1 second back on the game clock, and ordered the Celtics back onto the court to finish the game.

7. The Suns still didn't have much of a chance, as they were inbounding the ball under their basket with one second left. Then Paul Westphal showed his brilliance. He signaled to the referee for a timeout, even though the Suns did not have one. Since this was a technical, Boston received one free throw. Crucially though, the Suns now received the ball at half-court. Jo Jo White drained the free throw to give the Celtics a 112-110 lead.

8. During the Suns' timeout, the fans were still on the floor, interrupting Suns coach  John Macleod as he was drawing up a play for the final basket. Suns' players repeatedly had to shove the fans out of the way, and Phoenix general manager Jerry Colangelo even threatened to not bring his team back to the Boston Garden for Game 7. Once play finally resumed, Phoenix's Gar Heard took the inbounds pass from Perry and made a buzzer-beating shot (a turn-around jumper at the top of the key) for the Suns that tied the score yet again, 112–112.

Late in the 3rd overtime, Boston held a 128-122 lead, as Glenn Mcdonald, a reserve who had averaged 5.6 PPG for the Celtics that year, scored 6 in this overtime alone. Westphal scored the next 4 for Phoenix, but could not get the ball back for the rest of OT. He nearly stole a pass at half court as the clock winded down, but the Celtics were able to hold on for a thrilling 128-126 victory in 3OT. Jo Jo White led both teams in points and assists with 33 and 9 respectively, while Westphal scored 25 for the Suns. After the loss, the Suns were ready to avenge the defeat heading into Game 6 in Phoenix, but a spirited Celtics team sparked a 4th quarter run to win the game 87-80, and the series 4-2. Jo Jo White was named Finals MVP and the Celtics slowly went into a rebuild, eventually winning their 14th championship in 1980. The Suns would not reach the finals again until 1993, by which time Westphal had become their head coach. That season also featured another [heads up play by Westphal](https://new.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9c5h3s/charles_barkley_with_05_seconds_left/), though they would eventually lose to the Bulls in 6. They have not made the finals since.

I feel Harden doesn't have the stamina to last a full grueling 7 game conference finals series, The first half Harden is lights out, I feel most second halves he just fades away maybe it's due to his playstyle dribbling so many times I don't know. I knew that if CP3 was out for game 6 the series was over because I don't know if Harden is mentally or physically strong enough to get over the final hump, I still would have feared more if Harden went down, because CP3 is obviously not as skilled as Harden but maybe it's his demeanor on the court and I know he would die on the court to get a win those final two games, while I don't think Harden would.

Also I know he choked 2015 but this Houston team is better offensively and defensively than that clippers team.

205	What is your unpopular or controversial opinion relating to the NBA?	"Based on my search it's been 19 days since we had a straightforward unpopular opinion thread, so it's about time for another.  I'm asking for opinions that have been downvoted in other threads, but I ask that you be ready to defend your opinion.  It's no fun if you toss it out there and won't defend it.  And to those of you who disagree, try to refute the central point rather than just ridiculing the opinion or the person expressing the opinion.

I like to see these threads about every two weeks because the nature of Reddit discourages unpopular or controversial opinions, even when they are well reasoned and argued.  So I find these threads an outlet for those opinions.

Of course, because of the nature of Reddit, often the comments that rise to the top are not, in fact, unpopular.  So I suggest sorting by ""controversial"" or ""new"" or, if you sort by""top"" or ""best,"" scroll to the bottom of the list and work your way up.

I'll put my opinions in the comments so you can vote on them.  In this thread, try to resist downvoting opinions because you disagree.  Please reward people who stick around to defend their opinions, and do so well, even if you still disagree with them."	nba

207	[OC] Fun fact about Blocks and Steals Stats	"**The average league leading Blocks per game is 2.8 in recent years**

Highest bpg in a season is 5.6 bpg by Mark Eaton. The number of bpg is way higher back then and continue to regress as the league shifts to more 3 point shooting. The last player to hit 3 bpg mark is Hassan Whiteside with 3.68 bpg back in 2015-16

Current DPOY Rudy Gobert highest bpg season is at 2.6, while last year bpg leader is Anthony Davis with 2.57. In fact, last year AD 2.57 bpg is the lowest league leading blocks per game ever recorded.

______________________________________________________

**The average league leading Steals per game is 2.3 in recent years**

Last season spg leader is Oladipo with 2.36, last DPOY to lead to league in spg was Draymond with 2.03

You would think spg is higher but in fact, the last player to hit 2.5 spg mark is CP3 back in 2011-12. The last players to hit 3 spg is Alvin Robertson in 1990-91. Alvin also holds the record of highest spg at 3.7 in a season.

Michael Jordan tie John Stockton with their highest steals per game at 3.2

________________________________________________________

What about players that dominate both Stats?

**Players with at least 1.7 spg and 1.7 bpg**

Sam Lacey, Elvin Hayes, Julius Erving, Bobby Jones, 

Hakeem Olajuwon, Shawn Kemp, David Robinson, 

Gerald Wallace, Ben Wallace, Andrei Kirilenko,

Nerlens Noel and Paul Millsap


**Hakeem has 10 seasons averaging at least 1.7 spg and 1.7 bpg**

**The exclusive club of 2 spg and 2 bpg in a season** include Hakeem (4 times) David Robinson (once) and Gerald Wallace (once).

**Introduction**

The current Basketball Hall of Fame is just that, a hall of fame for anyone who has made a great contribution to the game of basketball. This is not only limited to play on the court in the NBA, but also play in college and internationally, coaching and management at all levels, and media personalities.

This exercise is so that [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) may have its own hall of fame based only on playing accomplishments in the NBA (and ABA in some cases). The goal of this is to have a much more exclusive club of NBA greats. The Basketball Hall of Fame has inductees every year, but the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) hall of fame will have inductees every week this offseason.

**How will it work?**

The first class will be composed of players who retired in 1960 or earlier. The second class will be composed of players who retired 1965 and earlier. The third class will be composed of players who retired 1970 and earlier, and so on.

The players listed must have higher than 20% hall of fame probability according to basketball-reference (just so that the ballots don't become too cluttered).

Each voter will get to choose between 1-5 players who they believe should make the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Any player who gets 50% or more of the vote will be inducted into the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Players who receive between 10% and 49.9% of the vote will be eligible in the next class.

Players who receive less than 10% of the vote will move down to the secondary ballot.

The same process is repeated for the secondary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the primary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will move down to the tertiary ballot.

The same process is again repeated for the tertiary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the secondary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will be ineligible for all future ballots. Also, players who receive 75% or more will skip the secondary and move straight to the primary ballot. New blood will be brought to this ballot from players who have more than 2% but less than 20% hall of fame probability.

Every other day the ballot will be posted as well as the results from the previous two days.

At the end of each week the inductees, their percentage of the votes, and whether they were first ballot, second ballot, etc will be posted as well as the ballot for the next class."	nba

221	NBA Realignment: 32 teams in 4 conferences	"My idea for NBA realignment is to expand to 32 teams and divide them into four conferences. For the expansion I chose Seattle, which I feel should never have lost their team, and southern coastal Virginia. So the league looks like so:

NORTH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . SOUTH

Minnesotta Timberwolves ......... Oklahoma City Thunder

Milwaulkee Bucks ..................... Dallas Mavericks

Chicago Bulls ........................... San Antonio Spurs

Indiana Pacers .......................... Houston Rockets

Detroit Pistons .......................... Atlanta Hawks

Cleveland Cavaliers ................... Phoenix Suns

Toronto Raptors ........................ Charlotte Hornets

 Memphis Grizzlies ..................... New Orleans Pelicans                      

WEST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EAST

Portland Blazers ........................ Boston Celtics

Golden State Warriors .............,,.. NY Knicks

Utah Jazz ...................................  Brooklyn Nets

Denver Nuggets ......................... Philadelphia 76ers

LA Clippers ................................. Washington Wizards 

LA Lakers ................................... Miami Heat    

Seattle Supersonics .................... Orlando Magic

Sacramento Kings ....................... Hampton Roadies 

Twice each season I would have each team play a three game series against every team in their conference. This is a main focus of the realignment: having actual series against conference opponents during the regular season. Teams would also play a 2 game (home and away) series against the teams in one of the other conferences on a rotating basis. 

Against the other 2 conferences teams would only play home OR away and these games would take place in what I am calling a ""schedule smash"". Every team in a conference plays every team in the opposing conference on consecutive nights. So teams play eight games in a row against the entire opposing conference alternating home and away games. 

That's six games against conference opponents, 2 games against the matched conference opponents, and one game against opponents in the other 2 conferences. A team would play 42 conference games and 32 nonconference games for a 74 game season.

I think this schedule has enough games to maintain the current NBA salary structure while at the same time by packing so many nonconference games into short periods of time it leaves most of the season to flow at a more natural pace. No more back to backs. Teams would have days to hold practices and they could use them to game plan against the opponent they were playing a series against. Fans would still get to see the league's stars since teams would be playing in nonconference arenas 2 out of three years. I believe fans will like having the regular season games that look more like the playoffs. Those who enjoy the current haphazard regular season can look forward to the chaos of the schedule smash when teams are just doing their best to adjust on the fly.

234	With just .5 left on the clock in Portland, Paul Westphal draws up what he calls the greatest play he has ever come up with		nba
235	Is John Wall becoming underrated?	"It looks like John Wall is becoming really underappreciated these last few months. He played only 41 games this season, some of them while being injured, and put up okay stats. 19.4/9.6/3.7. Did he deserve an All-Star? No, in my opinion. Wizards weren't that good, and Beal was the leader of the team for the most of regular season.

But Wall was back for playoffs, and man, he played amazing. Took 2 games from seed 1, and although Toronto disappeared in the next round, they were hitting their shots against Wiz. Wall averaged 26/11.5/5.7. Only 4 players averaged 25/10/5 (Magic, IT, Oscar, Westbrook x2). True, he didn't shoot so well but compared to these players, only Magic and Oscar had better TS than him. He really proved he's back, although the team didn't step up.

What next? Wall is in a very interesting situation. Coming back from serious injury, after his best season, he has a lot to prove. And it looks like the opportunity is there. Wizards have the best team in his career (I know y'all don't like Dwight, but he is replacing Gortat, and Rivers is a really good signing), he looks like he's putting work this offseason. East looks very interesting, and if things work out for Washington, I can see them taking 3rd seed, and maybe finally making a real playoff push. If not, don't be surprised if you see one of their stars on market before the trade deadline."	nba
236	What players in the league are definitely better than Lebron in atleast one aspect of basketball?

237	The last time Brandon Knight was healthy in '16-17, the Suns had a much worse net rating with him on the court (-9.4) than they did this past year with G-League PGs like Shaq Harrison (+13.8), Isaiah Canaan (+10.8), Mike James (+9.5) and even Tyler Ulis (-0.7).	"Not trying to beat a dead horse here, just legitimately curious about the intention behind the Knight acquisition. All signs point to him being one of the worst PGs in the entire league BEFORE tearing his ACL...he's a long way from what he was in Milwaukee.

Here's a chart with the stats I was talking about.



Player | Min | Team Net RTG ON | Team Net RTG OFF | DIFF
------|---|---------------|----------------|----
Knight ('16-17) | 1140 | -12.1 | -2.7 | -9.4
Harrison | 384 | +2.9 | -10.9 | +13.8
Canaan | 418 | 0.0 | -10.8 | +10.8
James | 669 | -1.9 | -11.4 | +9.5
Ulis | 1658 | -10.1 | -9.4 | -0.7

What this chart shows is that while the Suns weren't a ""good"" team starting any of these random nobodies and G-Leaguers throughout the season, with a couple of them they were playing either neutral or even slightly positive basketball on the court. Compare that to Knight and Ulis who significantly dragged the team's rating down throughout the past 2 years.

 Isn't there an argument to be made that this is addition by subtraction for the Suns? "	nba

246	Is Stephen Curry’s ball handling ability underrated?	I notice whenever his name is brought up it’s mostly about being the greatest shooter of all time. Sometimes about being one of the greatest point guards of all time. I know people will mention his efficiency as a shooter and how he hit threes off the dribble. Go watch his hilights on YouTube and tell me this man doesn’t put dudes on skates. Including Lebron James and Chris Paul. He deals some pretty sweet dimes too. 	nba

248	How many PPG could KD average?	"If he was on a team that maximized his points scoring?

Keep in mind that in OKC in his scoring peak he averaged 30 points per game on 62% TS.  And this was before the league went pace and space.

Keep in mind in OKC he had terrible spacing. The 2 guards were horrible shooters (Westbrook and Roberson) and the Center also provided zero spacing (Perkins then Adams).  Now imagine if KD played with guys who spaced the floor with him but didn't play with another elite scorer like Curry?

IMO, on a team where he would be the go to scorer and had a couple of elite spot up shooters and a stretch big he would score ridiculous amounts of points.

I think KD could average 35 points per game on 60% TS. Easy.

270	[OC] Collection of Wilt Chamberlain's clutch performances (all playoffs)	"Okay, i always wanted to list some of Wilt's clutch performances (partly to crush the choker myth, and partly because it's fun), and i finally have the time to do it. I'd say that the list's quiet impressive.

Credit goes to dantheman9758 for coming up with many of this before [in one of his forum post.](https://www.basketballforum.com/nba-forum/465788-wilt-chamberlain-would-destroy-todays-nba-6.html#post6753246) This post has more context for his performance though, including some where he choked, how he changed his role between game and game, and what his teammates doing, whether they played well with him or not, and whether Wilt could be blamed for this or not. Also, despite what i implied here, Jerry West couldn't be blamed completely for Wilt's losses because by the time Wilt arrived he already became injury prone, which explain games where he got outplayed or just played poorly.

Overall:

11 game winning shot, 2 in playoffs in recoverable newspapers clip.[ \(according to Dantheman\)](https://www.basketballforum.com/nba-forum/465788-wilt-chamberlain-would-destroy-todays-nba-6.html#post6753246)

Probably only player in NBA history to average at least 20 points and 20 rebounds while shooting at least 60% from the field across Game 7s in the playoffs according to Jaranarm and several forum posts.﻿ I haven't verified it, mainly because i couldn't find the posts anymore (it's all in memory, lol), but Wilt did have two G7 games where he shot at least at 80% (1965 and 1969 vs. Russell). However, with G5 vs Syracuse in 5-game series where he shot 22-48, he definitely didn't shot at that percentage if we also counted G5 in 5-game series.

1962 overall- Major gameplan overhaul that turned Wilt into 'normal' 35 PPG scorer and do other things instead. Warriors went from the worst defensively ([Opponent PPG wisely](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHW/1962.html)) into [second best](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1962.html) at the cost of scoring (second worst now). Gola was hurting in all but G7 ECF, and Arizin was unreliable as second scorer (went 18.2% in G7 vs Boston.) On the other hand, Meschery was on fire, scored 32 points vs Celtics in G7 as a rookie.

G5 1962 first round/ECSF G5- 56 points, 35 rebounds and 12 blocks. The only game in that playoff where Wilt scored more than 50 points, [mainly because his coach only wanted him to score 50 points in that game](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNC6uzGPMAI/VTwgVIhdVvI/AAAAAAAAGJc/5rmjr-Rrfc8/s800-Ic42/NBA%252520EDSF%252520Warrios%252520vs%252520Nationals%252520G5%2525201962%252528better%252520version%252529.jpg). Also, since it was just 5 game series (first team who won 3 games first win the series), this means that Wilt had the most points game in G7 or other series absolute last game equivalent by large margins (vs 47 points by Dom Wilkins and Sam Jones.)

G7 1962 ECF- 22 points and 22 rebounds on 7-15 shooting. Not impressive by his standard, but he shot 8/9 from the freethrow line, [and scored 5 points in 35 seconds in the last minute and nearly sent the game into overtime had Sam Jones didn't hit a miracle shot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/96rsxq/oc_wilt_chamberlains_g7_in_1962_ecf_had_him_only/). Also arguably got screwed by a controversial goaltending against Heinsohn before (according to Wilt's biography by Cherry.) His poor stats also explainable by him played out of pivot in the last three games according to Jaranarm, screwed his high percentages shot and rebounds. Unfortunately unverifiable, but plausible
considering that all of Warriors' starters suddenly got double digits rebounds in [G6.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196204030PHW.html)

G7 1965 ECF vs Boston: [30 points and 32 rebounds with 80% shooting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196504150BOS.html). Nearly won without healthy Luke Jackson (PF starter, only played for 18 minutes that match, replaced by 6-6 forwards who got fouled out). [Also scored 4 clutch points in the last minute and probably scored the last 10-12 points of the match \(according to him and several other 76ers account\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain#Philadelphia_76ers_\(1965%E2%80%931968\)) Wilt considered it as the match where his loser image became widespread instead, and Havlicek stole the show. Had Wilt won the game, the match may would be remembered as Russell's biggest choking moment instead, as he committed turnover with 5 seconds left from a botched inbound pass.

1966 G5: [46 points and 34 rebounds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196604120PHI.html). However, Wilt screwed team chemistry by not train with his teammates the day before and angered them, which made the rest of them shot below 40%, except Luke Jackson.

1967 overall- Triple Double average against Boston, [two](https://twitter.com/WiltCArchive/status/594194553143480320) [Quadruple Doubles](https://twitter.com/WiltCArchive/status/595996779193176066), 6 blocks in fourth quarter in one of the Finals match (unverifiable). [Also turned Thurmond into unreliable scorer \(34.3% shooting compared to his 55.2% before vs Beaty's Hawks.\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/1967-nba-finals-warriors-vs-76ers.html)

First match vs GSW in Finals: 16 points (4-9ft) 33 rebounds 10 assists 9 blocks. [Wilt blocked Thurmond's layup/hook shot in the last seconds to sent the game into overtime.](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KRNKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gYUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=allintext:+wilt+chamberlain+blocked+shots&amp;pg=1543,4981995&amp;hl=en)

1968 ECF: Not good performance by Wilt (blew up 3-1 lead), [thanks to injuries by many players, including Wilt](http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19671968.html). [Wilt had a very bad shooting night in G6](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196804170BOS.html), and only got 23 offensive touches in G7, just two in fourth quarter, probably due to his bad night before.

1969 Finals: Wilt unarguably choked throughout the series, but he [managed to step up in G7](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196905050LAL.html), scored 18 points on 7-8 shooting, with 27 rebounds. Breyda Koff screwed up by took him off when he sprained his ankle just to spite at him and proved that he didn't need big center to win. Real tragic hero was Jerry West though, the first and only Finals MVP from losing team with 42 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, played with injured hamstring.

1970 overall- In a herculean effort, Wilt overcame a big injury (ruptured patellar tendon) and returned just before the playoff, [scored 23 Points and 24 rebounds on 62.5% shooting against Willis Reed in the Finals.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1970-nba-finals-lakers-vs-knicks.html) The same injury took Jeremy Lin and
Roberson off the season, decades after advancements of medicine and surgery. Wilt wasn't playing at his best in G7 though, but the whole Lakers were outplayed by Knicks, especially West who got torched by Frazier with 36 points and 19 assists on 70.6% shooting. West was playing with injured shooting hand in G7 however.

[1971 G7 WCS vs Bulls](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197104060LAL.html): 25 points after spent the last four matches as low-scoring defensive player, won the series without injured Baylor and West. [He went to averaged 22 points vs Kareem in next series](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1971-nba-western-conference-finals-lakers-vs-bucks.html), higher than his 20.7 regular season average.

1972 overall- [Wilt scored 10.8 PPG vs Kareem,](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1972-nba-western-conference-finals-bucks-vs-lakers.html) and [19.4 PPG vs Knicks \(no Willis Reed\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/1972-nba-finals-knicks-vs-lakers.html). In both series, Wilt was showered by praises, despite much worse shooting vs Kareem (45.2%). Probably best example that Wilt's a reliable performer in playoffs regardless of stats and style of play.

1972 G6 WCF vs. Bucks- Wilt scored 20 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in 66.7% shooting after spent the last five games as 9 PPG defender. Rallied Lakers to won the game and overcame a 10 points deficit in 4th quarter, and outsprinted Kareem in fastbreaks. Jerry West called it as the greatest ball-busting performance he has ever seen.

1972 G4 Finals vs Knicks- Two blocks in OT, played aggressive defense with 5 fouls, shattered myth of him played too carefully when he got 5 fouls (probably still valid criticism in Reg. season, although his 2.0 fouls average made those matches very rare in the first place).

1972 G5 vs Knicks. Chamberlain with 24 points, on 10-14 shooting, with 29 rebounds, 4 assists, and 9 blocks. Finals MVP with broken hand. He won with Jerry West having subpar shooting performance, never shot above 40% in any match vs Knicks. Unlike other poor performances listed in this post, West just flat out admitted that he played a terrible series, despite his 8.8 assists average.

1973 WCS Game 7 vs Chicago Bulls: Wilt get 21pts and 28rbs. He also blocked a shot with 30 seconds left and threw a full court pass to Goodrich, who scored and give a lead for Lakers for the first time in second half.

1973 G5 Finals vs Knicks: Wilt scored 23 points and grabbed 21 rebounds, but lost the Finals thanks to subpar performance by West and Hairston, who were injured.

286	The recency bias concerning Durant vs Kobe is insane.	"Prime Kobe destroys Durant as a ball-handler/passer/play-maker. The recency bias around here is insane. Did everyone forget how awful and uncomfortable Durant looked in the 13/14/16 post-seasons whenever he was asked to handle the ball and create as the lead guy?  He's hidden this narrative being on a team where he doesn't need to do that. 

Seriously, there's a reason that prime Kobe beats Durant in EVERY impact metric we have available (RAPM, CORP, On/Off, WOWY) despite Durant's superiority in the box-score. No, Durant hasn't surpassed Kobe yet. The fact that such a consensus believes that he has, IMO, is a symptom of how over-reliant we have become on individual scoring efficiency as a measure of player performance. Individual scoring efficiency is important, and to be as absurdly efficient as Durant at such a high volume is more impressive still. But there are other aspects to the game, and I don't think they're given enough weight in many of the discussions here.



Part of the reason that individual scoring efficiency is so focused upon is that every ""advanced"" box score metric relies heavily on it. But since they have different names, people often site them as if they are giving different results. For example, Durant's advantages in TS%, PER, Offensive Rating and Win Shares all tie strongly to Durant's scoring efficiency advantage. Thus, citing each of them individually doesn't strengthen the case much IMO, since it's repetitive."	nba

292	Top 20 career VORPs under 60, inactive players not yet in HoF: 1.S. Marion, 2.L. Nance, 3.B. Wallace, 4.C. Webber, 5.V. Divac	"I kept VORP under 60 to knock out Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, and Paul Pierce, recently-retired stars who are shoo-ins for the Hall of Fame when they become eligible.  Shawn Marion is likely going into the Hall of Fame as well, but I still think of him as a role player.  

I actually think of Ben Wallace as the best player on his team, but defensive stars are ordinarily considered role players, even on a team that won with defense.  Larry Nance, Sr. was usually the best player on his team, but he's been eligible for the Hall of Fame for a long time without making it.  

Horace Grant is my favorite on this list simply because he's a former Bull, and I consider him very underrated.  I never heard of Alvan Adams before I made this list.  I must have missed him because I was more of a Eastern Conference fan in the 1980s.

VORP is a box score estimate of the points per 100 TEAM possessions that a player contributed above a replacement-level (-2.0 BPM) player, translated to an average team and prorated over an 82-game season.  Multiply by 2.7 to convert to wins over replacement.  

BPM and VORP can only be calculated going back to 1973-74, based on the statistics in the NBA box score.  It's an attempt to simulate more advanced stats that cannot be calculated going back more than a few years.  [Here's an article on BPM and VORP.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html)

293	It seems like a large part of the reason Bill and Wilt are highly rated is because they were tremendously athletic and therefore people believe they would be successful in any era ...	"Yet there are plenty of tremendously athletic players who are not successful in the modern NBA. 

Now you could say ""Wilt and Bill weren't just tremendously athletic, they were among the best athletes ever"" to which I would say that players today are on average more athletic than their predecessors *even accounting for their medical, training and equipment advantages*, largely due to the deeper talent pool and greater financial incentives. 

If Wilt and Bill had a 20% athletic advantage over their contemporaries and it drops to 10% in the modern era it is possible that their athletic advantage is no longer enough to overwhelm opponents.

294	Fun Fact: Wayne Ellington finished the 2017-18 NBA season with 169 more 3-pointers than 2-pointers; that is the highest differential in NBA history.	"This season, Wayne Ellington finished the season with 227 made 3’s compared to only 58 made 2’s.  The next highest differential belongs to Kyle Korver, who finished the 2004-05 season with 135 more made 3’s than 2’s.

Bonus Fact: Kyle Lowry finished this season with the most 3’s made of all time among players to make more 3’s than 2’s in a single season, with 238 made 3’s compared to only 165 made 2’s.

297	Hot takes that did not age well. With Cavs down 2-0 in the 2016 Finals, Colin Cowherd declares Lebron simply isnt that great anymore, cannot score 45 in a game anymore (Lebron then scored 41 twice the next week), and the league has simply passed him by (Lebron then stays the best player to this day)		nba

Tbch i think Lauri will go off more but ots a nice read if you got the time😏	nba
301	Who’s better offensively? KAT or Embiid?	"Obviously Embiid is a better player overall with his DPOY like defence but KAT has a good case for being the better offensive player. 

I’d say KAT is the best shooting center in the league right now. Post moves and Footwork are a bit closer tho.

304	Only 4 players in NBA History can match Joe Ingles’ career AST%, STL% and TS% with a minimum of 100 games played. Curry, Harden, Magic and Stockton.	"http://bkref.com/tiny/swFvT  
  
Just thought I'd share an incredible non-cherry picked stat to illustrate the greatness of Joe Ingles. His raw numbers for his career don't pop out to you but he has some of the best advanced stats that really fly under the radar. This in particular illustrates his diverse skill set and how well he plays as a support player.  
  
Adding on to that where does Joe Ingles rank in the NBA?  
  
In 2016-17 he averaged 7/3/3 on 45/41/74 shooting and during the offseason he was ranked the following in top 100 lists.  
-Unranked by ESPN and Sports Illustrated  
-94th by the Washington Post  
-84th by Yahoo  
-64th by Bleacher Report  
  
This year he improved completely posting career highs in almost every stat and averaging 12/4/5 on 47/44/80 shooting (2.5 threes per game). He also continued his form into the playoffs where he averaged 15/4/3 on 47/46/65 shooting with 3.2 threes per game. Joe isn't just an ordinary 3&amp;D player and what sets him apart is his playmaking skills including averaging 6.4 assists per game post all star break and 7.0 for his last 20 regular season matches.  
  
Where do you rank him in the entire overall and for his position."	nba
305	How good is Jason Tatum?	The Celtics are my second favorite team and I like Tatum, but don’t get the hype. Yes he makes plays and showed out in the playoffs, but everyone is acting like he’s gonna be a superstar in the NBA. While that could be true as crazier things have happened, if I’m building for the future there are many other young guys I would rather have in my organization. Honestly, in the superstar era we are in today with championship teams needing a player like Lebron, KD, or Steph, i am very concerned as a Celtics fan, because I honestly see Tatums ceiling being a prime Paul George type player, which is fine, but not going to win, especially when in a Division with the sixers, who happen to have 2 young players with clear mvp ceilings, and another one with legit all star potential and draws comparisons to James Harden. The sad part is that my Celtics are in their window right now(emerging young player with great vets), but unfortunately in two years when the warriors finally decline, it will be too late for Boston to win. 	nba
306	Magic Johnson vs Larry Bird in this era.	"Usually I see white folks overrate the hell out of Larry but I think he wins this one easily. Magic is not a good fit for this era. Bird is a sniper with amazing passing skills. It would be extremely easy to build around. Magic wouldn't even be better than Simmons in this era. Don't get me wrong now, Magic has done 100000x more than simmons and is far better in ""HIS"" era than Simmons. But Simmons is just far more athletic, Magic is a better passer but I just don't see him being a superstar in this era. He's not a freak athlete and he can't shoot. In his era he had athletic advantages but in this era he wont'. Bird wouldn't be as good as Durant in this era but he'd still be an absolute superstar."	nba
307	Has anyone here gone to an NBA game alone?	"I usually bring my family but when it comes to these ticket prices, I believe Carmelo Anthony said it best.

311	Which NBA personnas match the Greek Gods?	"The Olympians were the chlidren of Cronus and Rhea: Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter and Hera plus the children of Zeus: Athena, Aphrpdite, Artemis, Ares, Apollo, Hephaistus, Hermes and Dionysus. They are 13 because there is a version that leaves Hestia out and a version that leaves Dionysus out (the Gods had to be 12 because they were counting in dozenal). I'll also add Hades even though he was not an Olympian he is one of the ""big 3"" (Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) that overthrew the Titans (who were the older generation of gods).

I'll focus on active or recently retired players / coaches.

**Zeus**, the youngest son of Cronus and Rhea was God of the sky and thunder. He was also the king of the gods and the god of justice. He was considered the ultimate god in terms of both power and wisdom. As such, it is only fitting to match him with **LeBron James**. Their big difference was that Zeus was a big womanizer unlike LeBron. LeBron only drops his towel in front of his wife and Lue.

**Poseidon**  was God of the sea and natural disasters like storms and earthquakes. He was extremely powerful and had a temper. Noone wanted to see his bad side as he'd become very hard to calm down once angered and wasn't the compromising type. As such, I'll say he is **Kobe Bryant**.

**Hades** was God of the underworld and the earth, night and dreams. He was the quiet type that took the job noone of the cool guys in Olympus wanted, to rule over the underworld. He was very bored with his dull job and was known to pose interesting challenges to visitors of the underworld to entertain himself. I think the one matching this description would be **Tim Duncan** as he was known to be timid but secretly playful.

**Hera** was the Goddess of marriage and family. She was married to Zeus and was loyal to him even though he cheated on her all the time. She was very jealous and punished all the lovers of Zeus. She blessed happy married couples and punished infidelity. I'd say the player that matches is **Russel Westbrook** as he was always loyal to the Thunder but he now is trying to punish KD for betraying their family.

**Demeter** was the Goddess of agriculture, the circle of life and morality. Demeter was serene. Her daughter by Zeus, Persephone was abducted by and married to Hades and became Queen of the Underworld. However, Demeter convinced Hades to let her daughter spend half the year in the overworld thus creating the cycle of the seasons. I'd say it's **Gregg Popovich** that had created a situation of permanent fertility but Kawhi left and soon the Spurs will probably have to go through the cycle of tanking.

**Hestia** was the Goddess of home, hearth and order in both family and the state. She was the eldest and most peaceful of all the gods and she only provides humans the comfort and blessing of home. She never gets confrontational and never judges or delivers punishment. She is the one who receives the offerings to the gods. I'd say Hestia is the perhaps most peaceful and loveable NBA personna, **Dirk Nowitzki**.

**Athena** was born out of Zeus' head and was the Goddess of wisdom, logic and strategy. She was one of the most loved and respected gods (hence, Athens is named after her) and in most myths was the goddess who helped the ""hero"". She also got involved in human affairs a lot, providing guidance. Athena was generally serious but she wouldn't back down from challenges. I'd say Athena is **Brad Stevens**  trying to guide the young Celtics towards contention.

**Apollo** was the God of the sun, light, knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, health and disease. Apollo was also considered an extremely important god next to Athena. His personality was very complex and his behaviour unpredictable. He often provided all kinds blessings and gave all kinds of curses. I think **Kahwi Leonard** is NBA's Apollo. Can be a game changer but can also make everything crumble. Noone knows exactly what he is thinking.

**Ares** was the God of war and violence. He represented our brutal instincts to dominate by force and is the god most hated by Zeus and most feared by humans. In most myths he is on the losing side and defeated by Athena's side (as strategy &gt; brute force) who likes to make fun of him and he hates her for that. Since Brad Stevens is Athena I think the most fit to be Ares would be **Joel Embiid** because of this year's playoffs. It could also have been Giannis but I think Embiid fits better as he is much more of a trash talker than Giannis.

**Aphrodite** was the Goddess of love, sexuality, lust, allure and persuasion.  Every human that laid eyes on her would see her in the form of the ideal woman of his fantsasies. Anyone she touched (including Gods) would fall in love with her. She oversees all forms of sexual relationships from pure innocent love to prostitution. She was quite mischievous. Aphrodite is thus **Stephen Curry** cause he is the ideal fit to any team and attracts superstars like a magnet.

**Hephaistus** is the God of fire, volcanos and also god of blacksmiths and craftsmen of any kind. He was worshipped especially in Athens that was very industrialized. He is rather plain and rough looking while all of his brothers are very handsome. He also has the least women affairs. However, he is the one married to Aphrodite (though Aphrodite has way more affairs, most notably with Ares). Hephaistus forged all the weapons of the Gods in his workshop. He was quiet and focused on his craft. I'd say he is the one that matches **Klay Thompson** the most.

**Artemis** was the Goddess of the moon, the forest and wilderness, the hunt, archery and virginity. Artemis was the wild beauty, the maiden of the Gods. Artemis was fierce, honest and pure. I'm between Giannis and AD but since the animal most associated with Artemis is the deer it has to be **Giannis**. Unlike Artemis, though, Giannis likes to foreplay at night.

**Hermes** was the God of messengers, travelers, merchants, thieves and games/sports. He was also the guide to the underworld. In ancient Greece, being messenger was one of the most honorable proffessions and messengers would be invited in the houses of the rich to tell their stories, hence the messenger of the Gods is an Olympian God himself and not just a henchman. Hermes was also the most cunning God (he was basically associated with what we call ""street smarts"") and would sometimes trick other Gods since he had control over all information. Obviously, the Hermes of the NBA is **Adrian Wojnarowski**.

**Dionysus** was the God of party, wine, ecstacy, euphoria, ritualistic madness and theatre. He was always accompanied by exotic animals and there is always an endless party around him. The dionysian rituals involved drinking and dancing till your mind lost all fear and care. There were also several cult clubs themed around Dionysus with a wide variety of rituals. Dionysus was basically the God of being high. Since Michael Beasley has wisened up, he can only be **J.R. Smith**."	nba
312	In his last 41 regular season games of the 2017-18 season, Dario Šarić averaged 15.5 PPG, 6.4 RPG and 2.6 APG with a TS% of 60.6% in only 28.8 MPG	"He also continued his form into the postseason, averaging 17.2 PPG, 7.3 RPG and 3.5 APG on a TS% of 54.6% (sizably above average in the postseason) in 32.9 MPG. He was arguably the best player for Philadelphia in the series against Boston which while was only 5 games, had mostly close games throughout.

He has played very well over his last 50 games, and is only 23 years old, which still leaves a lot of time for him to develop, especially considering the large leap he made from his first to 2nd season, especially in 3-point shooting where he went from 31.1% on 4.2 attempts per game to 39.3% on 5.1 attempts per game.

I believe that Šarić is among the most underrated players in the entire NBA currently and will become even better in the next few seasons when he is able to get more playing time and play a bigger role within the team. He definitely deserves more recognition and should be easily considered as a top 10 power forward in the league with room for improvement."	nba

317	Context vs Statistics	"Over the last week we've had daily posts that consider KD a better player than Kobe.  Allen Iverson overrated.  One comparing Giannis with LeBron at his age, and saying Giannis is better, purely based on the stat comparisons.  

There's no excuse for not going back and watching games/series of players from the 2k eras, just because Giannis has similar stats that LeBron averaged at his age, LeBron had already been to the finals and conference finals.  He's not better because he's more efficient.  Kevin Durant is *not* close to a better player than Kobe as far as careers go at this point.  Allen Iverson wasn't an overrated loser.  

Go back and watch some playoff series, they're readily available, and ones after 2006/7 are even in full HD.  Go watch how those eras played with 1 on 1 defense and iso heavy scoring.  Go watch the gravity a guy like LeBron brought to the floor, go watch how Kobe demanded a double team whenever he was hot.  Now go watch Giannis/KD in the switch friendly era.  

There's an excuse for not watching Wilt or Russell, it's not available.  The game quality of Magic/Bird is pretty shitty because the league may not have film to remaster into HD/4k.  But Kobe?  LeBron?  Not hard to do.  

Context matters just as much as your little basketball reference copy/pastes.  "	nba
318	Performances where you thought to yourself, “wow this man is gonna be a first ballot hall of famer”	"What are some performances (regular season or playoffs) where you thought to yourself a legend was born?

For me it’s the 2001 Finals Game 1 where AI dropped 48pts on probably the greatest team ever at the time, the ‘01 Lakers. The quintessential David vs Goliath fight in basketball form.

319	How would the game change if dunks were worth 3 points?	"Just a fun little thought. What would happen to offensive and defensive strategies if dunks were worth 3 points? Would Capela-type rolling bigs become much more valuable? Would players fake layups/bank shots to do off-the-backboard alley-oops? Would spacing get even crazier? Who would be the MVP? Would guys leak out/cherry-pick way more?

Until someone comes up with a better definition we'll imagine that the league checks if a player's fingers touch the rim on a shot to determine if it's a dunk. Sorry Blake.

Also let's ignore the huge injury risk involved."	nba

324	Steph Curry goes 5/5 from 3 in the 4th after Kendrick Perkins kerfuffle	"[SKYFUCKED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmgdJe7LFVM)

Steph Curry was walking backwards along the sideline when an oversized, overpaid, useless Cavs player named Kendrick Perkins appeared, with his oversized, overpaid, useless knees in the way. After bumping into him, Curry turned around to ask him politely to get the fuck out of the way, as Perkins stood up and attempted to come up with a valid reason for why he still hasn't received a Cavaliers Jersey. After getting in each other's face for a brief moment, Curry asked him ""Waddup big fella?"" and Perkins was lost for words, staring intensely as he often does.



No technicals or other violations were assessed (good work refs) and Curry went on to end the game almost single-handedly with 5 3's including 1 shot clock buzzer-beating, hail mary moonshot over Kevin Love, and a 4 point play in the corner... again over Kevin Love.  Curry finished with 9 3's on 17 attempts, breaking a record set by Ray Allen in Game 2 vs. the Lakers in 2010. Kendrick Perkins is looking to set his own record of most team games attended in a suit, but Derrick Rose still maintains a sizeable lead.

Lakers fans are left puzzled at the end of this confrontation, wondering how Larry Nance Jr. is sitting on the ground for stretches of the game, while a cheerleader is given a seat with the active players."	nba

This is now the fourth year since the inception of the Most Average Lineup award. The selection process remained identical during that entire span, and since the method yielded pretty consistent results in terms of pure numbers so far, it shall remain unchanged in this rendition as well.

The first step of the process is determining the average values for five main statistical categories by using the median function on the [ESPN’s leaderboard](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics) featuring players who participated in 70% of available games. Of course, unlike in Harris’ case when the analysis was based on the pool containing all qualified NBA players, five different leaderboards for five different positions will be used. The average values established using that procedure will provide the initial framework, or rather the prototype of the average player for each position.

The next step is finding players who are the closest to fitting into the average player mold. Once the best available candidates are found, they will be compared in terms of advanced stats and the eye-test, where having no extraordinary characteristics is positively valued.

Here are the last season’s most average players for each position, along with the data for previous seasons.

The nominees: **De’Aaron Fox, Ish Smith**

Both the Kings’ rookie point guard and the Pistons’ established veteran came incredibly close to the perfect average point guard in terms of basic stats. Fox and Smith posted the exact required assist average, and the deviations in terms of points and rebounds were minimal, with Smith gaining a slight advantage.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ish+Smith&amp;player_id1_select=Ish+Smith&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=smithis01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=De%27Aaron+Fox&amp;player_id2_select=De%27Aaron+Fox&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=foxde01&amp;idx=players)

Since that tiny advantage could not be considered the decisive factor, their respective Player Efficiency Rating for the previous season was consulted. For those who are not aware, PER is calibrated each season so that its average value is precisely 15.0.

Considering that Smith’s PER of 15.4 is much closer to the average threshold than Fox’s 11.2, it becomes clear that the 8-year veteran has a significantly better case for the label of the average point guard. Even common sense supports that decision, since Fox was still a rookie last season and wasn’t able to play fully to his strengths yet, while Smith is a 30-year old who has been considered a solid sixth/seventh man material throughout his whole career, which is exactly what is required in this context.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Tyler Johnson, Courtney Lee, Marco Belinelli**

The average shooting guard has apparently evolved into a more proficient scorer than in the past years, and the three final candidates reflect that. Johnson and Belinelli are known as strong, albeit streaky scorers, and Lee, who was *the* average shooting guard two years ago, has always been a reliable 3-and-D option.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Tyler+Johnson&amp;player_id1_select=Tyler+Johnson&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=johnsty01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Courtney+Lee&amp;player_id2_select=Courtney+Lee&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=leeco01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Marco+Belinelli&amp;player_id3_select=Marco+Belinelli&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=belinma01&amp;idx=players)

In terms of basic stats, all three would be a justified selection for the middle-of-the-pack shooting guard. Not even PER helps break the three-way tie, since all three guys were pretty much identical in terms of efficiency last season. Looking at the Box Plus/Minus, however, shows that while Lee and Belinelli were net positives on offense and negatives on defense, Johnson was average at both ends of the floor.

Finally, other than perhaps his athleticism, Johnson doesn’t really stand out on the field in any other aspect. He doesn’t particularly hurt the Heat chances of winning on any given night, but is also not that impactful of a factor on the court. The only thing that could bother the Heat fans in this case is the fact that their front office is paying $19 million for nothing more than an average shooting guard.

The nominees: **Dillon Brooks, Mario Hezonja, Jeff Green, Jae Crowder**

There has been plenty of small forwards last season who neither thrilled their respective fanbases nor overly disappointed them. The two young guns, Brooks and Hezonja, had relatively promising, but not particularly strong years, while the two veterans, who were both on the Cavaliers roster at the start of the season, had pretty mediocre years – at least within the context of their careers.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Dillon+Brooks&amp;player_id1_select=Dillon+Brooks&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=brookdi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Mario+Hezonja&amp;player_id2_select=Mario+Hezonja&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=hezonma01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Jeff+Green&amp;player_id3_select=Jeff+Green&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=greenje02&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Jae+Crowder&amp;player_id4_select=Jae+Crowder&amp;y4=2018&amp;player_id4=crowdja01&amp;idx=players)

While the basic statlines of the entire quartet support their candidacy for the average small forward, advanced parameters don’t favor two of the four players. Both Brooks, who was a rookie, and Crowder, who switched teams mid-season, were too far removed from the average values in terms of PER and BPM to be considered as valid average small forwards.

Among the remaining two candidates, the PER definitely favors Green, who finished the season with an efficiency rating of 14.8. Hezonja is, however, much closer to the typical small forward in terms of BPM, and also gains an edge in all the basic categories. Furthermore, Hezonja spent more time at the small forward position than Green who often filled in as a power forward, thus making Hezonja a clear-cut option for receiving the most average SF ribbon.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Ersan Ilyasova, Trey Lyles, Marvin Williams**

Ilyasova, Lyles and Williams are the three players who are the most viable options for getting their first most average team selections. In this case, the basic stats clearly favor Ilyasova, since he is the closest to fitting the mold of the average power forward in terms of points, rebounds *and* assists.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ersan+Ilyasova&amp;player_id1_select=Ersan+Ilyasova&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=ilyaser01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Trey+Lyles&amp;player_id2_select=Trey+Lyles&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=lylestr01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Marvin+Williams&amp;player_id3_select=Marvin+Williams&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=willima02&amp;idx=players)

The next step, i.e. analysis of advanced stats, also strongly suggests that Ilyasova is the perfect choice for the title of the most average power forward. His PER of 14.6 and BPM of 0.1 are extremely close to the league-wide average values, which, coupled with his advantage in the basic stats department, puts him clearly ahead of the Hornets’ and the Nuggets’ big men.

After all, utilizing bigs who can stretch the floor with their soft touch, rather than fielding physical forwards who mostly reside in the paint, has recently become one of the most prominent trends, and Ilyasova as the average power forward clearly reflects that trend.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Larry Nance Jr., Jarrett Allen, John Henson, Dwight Powell**

After being titled the average center for two out of past three season, Robin Lopez is finally not even in the race this season. There are, however, four centers who may be considered average, at least in terms of their baseline numbers. At a first glance, neither of the four had a particularly outstanding season.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Larry+Nance+Jr.&amp;player_id1_select=Larry+Nance+Jr.&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=nancela02&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Jarrett+Allen&amp;player_id2_select=Jarrett+Allen&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=allenja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=John+Henson&amp;player_id3_select=John+Henson&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=hensojo01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Dwight+Powell&amp;player_id4_select=Dwight+Powell&amp;y4=2018&amp;player_id4=poweldw01&amp;idx=players)

Comparing their average stats to the stats of the average center, it seems as though Nance Jr. and Powell have the best case for getting away with it this season. Surprisingly though, both were far from being mediocre this season, at least from an advanced analytics standpoint. Powell and Nance Jr. posted a PER of 18.8 and 20.2 respectively, which put them both in the [Top 50](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=bdOlH) players of the last season according to that metric.

With Allen and Henson, the situation was much closer, but Henson was more convincing in converging towards an average center in all categories than Allen was. Again, Henson seems like a solid choice since he was not a player who either greatly influenced the Bucks’ chances in a positive or a negative manner last season. He scored around the rim at a respectable clip, grabbed some rebounds, blocked some shots; exactly what you would expect from a center that is not a franchise player.

The 2017-18 Average Center: **John Henson**

---

**Smith, Johnson, Hezonja, Ilyasova, Henson** – this lineup definitely doesn’t ooze greatness; if we’re being honest, that starting five is sentenced to a tanking season from its very beginning. In a league that is so evidently driven by starpower, a team exclusively made up of average players is bound for failure, which is the likely destiny of this group.

Keep in mind, this team represents the average of all players in the league, not just the starters. Expecting a lineup composed of worst starters / best sixth men of their respective teams to consistently perform at the highest level would not be a smart move in the first place.

However, if you add two or three stars to that team, they suddenly don’t look to shabby. Guys who know their roles and offer a balanced brand of offense and defense would provide a respectable support for the centerpieces carrying the team.

While the average players might be considered the foundation of the league, the stars are what the ultimate success of a team depends on. There have been just a few exceptions to that rule throughout NBA history, and this objectively unimpressive 1st All-NBA Average Team further confirms that.

1. https://imgur.com/Bw5pNNm This is the first important screenshot of the play. Kobe turns the ball over at approximately 85 feet away from his own basket. He has a lot of ground to cover

2.  https://imgur.com/CUtVYOD This picture denotes when the Nuggets player starts passing it to Andre Miller. As you can see, Miller isn't even in the picture, he's about at half court. Kobe's at the opposite free-throw line

3. https://imgur.com/nYUBTzv This is the first frame where we see Andre Miller. The ball is a little over halfway to the destination and Andre Miller just crossed the half court line. Kobe hasn't even reached the 3-point line yet.

4. https://imgur.com/7nzjQCD This is the last frame we see Kobe in the picture. He's at the very back, still pretty far away from the half court line. Andre Miller is nearing the 3-point line and the ball is close to his hands. Looks like an easy layup at this point.

5. https://imgur.com/ZZTEpzm This is the final frame we get from this angle. Kobe is not in the picture, Miller has the ball, and he's about 2 steps away from the uncontested layup. How he doesn't make this, I don't know.

6. https://imgur.com/8FaAJPo This is from the replay, which is a about 0.5 seconds behind the last picture. Here we see Andre Miller with the ball inside the 3-point line. Kobe has still not crossed the half court line.

7. https://imgur.com/1EeUo54 A few seconds later and all of a sudden this looks like he actually might be able to block it. This is the first frame where a block looks somewhat realistic. Kobe just crossing the free throw line and Andre Miller has just gone up for the layup.

This is a pretty crazy chase-down block. One of my favorites. It really doesn't make much sense how Kobe actually blocked it, but he somehow did.

Lakers were up 17 with 6 minutes left in the 4th when this block happened - the game was over. There was really no reason to put that much effort for the chase down block, but Kobe did.

349	Since AI seems to be one of the topics of the day here, I thought I'd share some of his teammates offensive stats during the 2001 playoffs	"**Aaron Mckie:** 13.1 FGA, 50% TS%

**Eric Snow:** 9.1 FGA, 47% TS%

**Dikembe Mutombo:** 9.0 FGA, 58% TS% (fyi almost all of his FGs were made similar to how Deandre Jordan gets his buckets)

**Tyrone Hill:** 6.9 FGA, 46% TS%

**Jemaine Jones:** 5.4 FGA, 47% TS%

**George Lynch:** 5.0 FGA, 51% TS%

And then of course theres **Iverson**, with his 30.0 FGA and 48% TS%

So as u can see, in the context of his team, he did what he had to do.  It wouldve been nice had he made more of his shots, but no reasonable person would suggest that any one of the other guys was capable of carrying even a decent portion of the shooting workload at a good efficiency.

(Disclaimer: these other guys were not complete bums - they played excellent team defense and that's a huge part why they made it to the finals and won a game against the lakers)"	nba

362	Comparing Kevin Durant's scoring from ages 21-30 to other superstars	"This in reference to this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9c80k3/kevin_durant_since_age_21_9_seasons_has_averaged/

The post compares Durant's scoring numbers in his first nine seasons, which happens to be from when he was 21 until now, when he's 29.

I didn't think it was a very fair comparison considering it included Jordan's, Kobe's, and LeBron's numbers past their 9th season. Not only is that fair in the case of Jordan because it includes his 35 year season, those players also end up having a much larger sample size than Durant - and that point was sort of missed.

So here are all four again, this time using each of their first nine seasons from when the age of 21.

---

Kevin Durant **(2010-2018)**: 28.2 pts on 62.5% TS

Kobe Bryant **(2000-2008)**: 28.3 pts on 55.6% TS

LeBron James **(2006-2014)**: 28.3 pts on 59.4% TS

Michael Jordan **(1985-1993)**: 32.3 pts on 58.9% TS

---

I also thought it would be worth it to compare their post-season numbers using the same criteria. Since Durant has been in eight post-seasons, that's the number we'll use for all players.

Kevin Durant **(2010-2018)**: 28.8 pts on 59.1% TS

Single handily won a bunch of games like the Memphis, Orlando, Nuggets, Rockets(poster on capela) just to name a few.

368	Thanos Snaps the NBA: The Los Angeles Lakers	"Again, to clarify my methods. There is a 50% chance that a player will be snapped (killed) by Thanos. This time I used random.org to determine if a player survived.

Snapped: Luol Deng, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Moritz Wagner, JaVale McGee, Travis Wear, Joel Berry II, Jeffrey Carroll

Survivors: Michael Beasley, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Isaac Bonga, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, LeBron James, Lance Stephenson, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, Alex Caruso, Jonathan Williams, Ivica Zubac


Well fuck. I guess the Lakers are going to win. That is still an incredibly solid starting 5. Yes, the team doesn't have a good center, but I think Lebron, Kuzma, and Stephenson could all handle a small lineup, especially in a league full of snapped centers. This is an incredibly deep post-snap team. The biggest loss to this team is meme potential, but they still have Stephenson, so they even keep some of that. This team might legitimately be better than last year's Cavs team. Thanos was no match for LeThanos. At least Lonzo died.

"Had a debate at the barbershop about the Lakers retiring Lebron's number.The Majority of the people said theres nothing LeBron could do to get his number retired by the lakers because he'll only be there for a short time. But heres my point:

Even tho he'll only be in LA for at Least 4 years,  IF (big if) he brings at least 2 Championship to the Lakers, he'll probably get his number retired by them. Wilt was in LA for only 5 years with 1 chip and got his number retired so why can't LeBron do the same? Whats your guys opinion?"	nba

381	Mats Wermelin: The Greatest Basketball Player That Never Played	"According to the 1985-86 edition of Guiness World Records ([as quoted by the L.A. Times](http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-04/sports/sp-9228_1_cold-fish)), a 13 Swedish boy named Mats Wermelin scored 272 points in a basketball game in February 5, 1974. That alone is insane, but it's also worth mentioning the final score was 272 points.

He scored all 272 points. The other team scored none. 272 points. None. The kid was 13 years old.

At first glance it seems we have the GOAT, perhaps surpassing MJ, LeBron, Kobe, and more if he kept it up and joined the big leagues. We could only imagine how many championships he would have won.

But let's take a closer look at this. There's unfortunately no video showcasing Mats' apparently legendary display. I decided to do some digging. I found [this article](http://www.fiba.basketball/news/-hoop-dreams-some-stories-you-might-have-missed) from FIBA discussing the matter (fifth paragraph). Funnily enough it mentions Mats actually scored 232 points, but still claims the other team scored zero points. 

FIBA, if you don't know, is the official governing body of basketball. Basically it's FIFA, but basketball. They have World Cups and sanction basketball in the Summer Olympics. 

To me the official website of the governing body of a sport would be a very reliable source. Though the point difference is odd. Everywhere else it says he scored 272. Weird. 

When you look up Mats Wermelin it comes up with images of [this guy](http://shipmanagementinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mats-Wermelin.jpg). According to his [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mats-wermelin-01309b1b), he's a member of DNB, a banking company headquarted in Norway. Various sources give different locations for what part of the world Mats works for. I bet we could access more information, like his age, on his Linkedin page, but it requires you to sign up, and yeah, I'm not signing up for something I'm going to use one time and never again. I don't really think this is our guy anyway. 

Okay, so, why am I making this? [Someone already made a reddit post about this as early as a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6wzvhi/in_1974_13yr_old_mats_wermelin_scored_272_points/).

Well, it's simple really. This whole thing seems...incomplete, I guess. I just feel there's several pieces to this story we're missing. I wouldn't really find the story that hard to believe (even though the part about the other team scoring nothing seems unlikely), but there's not a lot of information online about this. 

I need your help, is what I'm saying. This is a mystery waiting to be solved. The mystery of who Mats Wermelin is, if he really scored 272 points at the age of 13, if the other team didn't score at all, why didn't he continue playing basketball. If you find anything, please let me know in the comments. Thanks.

387	Who's the better basketball player? Kevin Durant or prime Larry Bird?	"*Note: This is not a comparison of their careers. Obviously Larry had a better career than current KD.*

---
Let's look at their best seasons per 100 possessions:

* **1985 Larry Bird**: 34/13/8 on 52/43/88 shooting splits (59 TS%)

* **2014 Kevin Durant**: 42/10/7 on 50/39/87 shooting splits (64 TS%)

Advanced stat comparison: Both players lead the league in PER, VORP, and win shares. Larry also lead the league in BPM, while KD was 2nd behind Lebron. However KD lead the league in scoring, something Bird has surprisingly never done. 

* PER: Durant

* W/S 48: Durant

* VORP: Tie

* BPM: Tie

---

There are lots of things to consider here. For example, style of play. 

Would Larry have taken more threes in this era and increased his TS% and scoring output? 

Would KD be able to get to rim and lead the league in free throws in an era where you could chokeslam drivers out of the air? 

How would Larry match up against today's athletes? 

Just looking at the numbers KD seems better. I didn't actually watch Larry play other than on youtube, so i don't really know.

393	The Dota 2 hero equivalents of NBA players	"Since [The International 8](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International/2018) just ended recently (and EG were tragically defeated), I thought I would continue the offseason NBA-player/videogame-character comparison shitpost series with the Dota 2 hero equivalents of various NBA players.

**James Harden – [Enchantress](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Enchantress)**

Enchantress deals heavy damage at long range. In fact the longer the range, the higher the damage she can deal with her ult. She has a skill called untouchable which slows the attack speed of anyone who attacks her to comically low levels. She abuses this skill to dominate nearly anybody in a 1v1 lane. James Harden is similarly untouchable, with anyone who attempts to defend him immediately whistled for a foul, resulting in constant free throws slowing the game down to comically low levels. Also, her signature skill is enchant which allows her to take control of neutrals for a short duration. Playing against enchantress, there is a constant risk of being ganked by groups of large creeps under her control. This is the exact same risk facing anyone who encounters James Harden at a nightclub.

**Lebron – [Spectre](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Spectre)**

Nobody is more terrifying late in a game than Spectre. She scales harder than anyone and is capable of coming back from enormous deficits by abusing her ult, allowing her to be everywhere on the map damaging anyone on the enemy team. She needs support to get there, but simply put: Spectre is the hardest carry in the game.

**Steph – [Enigma](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Enigma)**

Enigma uses his ult, Black Hole, to suck in the entire enemy team with his inescapable gravity. He is also able to summon an army of demonic conversions to fight for him, much like Steph is able to summon an army of ring chasing vets to fight for him.

**Klay – [Sniper](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper)**

Takes a while to come online, but can deal unparalleled damage from long range.

**KD – [Venomancer](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Venomancer)**

Venomancer is obviously a poisonous snake, but the connection goes deeper than this. Venomancer’s signature skill is plague ward, allowing him to place small immobile units around the map dealing poison damage to anyone they attack. This is analogous to KD’s burner accounts which leave toxic comments all over the internet, poisoning the minds of those who read them.

**Derrick Rose – [Techies](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Techies)**

Techies is iconic, and following his release in dota 2, he was a strong, borderline broken hero. But after a series of nerfs, he has been relegated to the dumpster. Possibly never to return. His signature skill, Blast Off, allows Techies to launch himself at an enemy, dealing massive damage to both himself and enemy heroes in the blast radius. Much like Derrick Rose recklessly launches himself at the rim, with a chance to score and to blow out a knee.

**Kyrie – [Timbersaw](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Timbersaw)**

Timbersaw is a mobile, fast paced hero who zips around fights dealing large bursts of AOE damage to the enemy team. He is also a [paranoid schizophrenic](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/0/0a/Timb_kill_13.mp3) who [believes](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/b/bb/Timb_spawn_04.mp3) that [trees](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/9/95/Timb_begin_02.mp3) are [trying](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/1/17/Timb_ally_01.mp3) to [kill](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/7/77/Timb_death_11.mp3) him [everywhere](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/c/ca/Timb_attack_08.mp3) he [goes](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/1/10/Timb_rare_01.mp3). Nobody understands the burden of this kind of knowledge like Kyrie does. (warning: loud voice responses in the links. RIP headphone users.)

**Joel Embiid – [Axe](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Axe)**

Axe is loud and boisterous. He knows he is the best and makes sure everyone else knows it too. He taunts enemy heroes into attacking him and deals counter damage with his passive. He also throws down massive dunks on low HP heroes.

**Ty Lawson – [Brewmaster](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Brewmaster)**

Brewmaster is an alcoholic.

**Kawhi – [Ursa](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ursa)**

Ursa is adept at pursuing and destroying a single target. Stacking up massive amounts of damage with every swipe of his claws.

**Ricky Rubio – [Crystal Maiden](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Crystal_Maiden)**

Crystal Maiden is fragile and offensively limited, but her support enables her teammates to run amok with roots, slows, and bonus mana regen. They are also both beautiful people.

**Steven Adams – [Centaur Warrunner](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Centaur_Warrunner)**

Centaur has the highest strength of any hero in the game. He is an absolute unit. Although Centaur is usually picked for the utility he provides, he can output a surprising amount of offensive damage when given the chance.

**Russell Westbrook – [Chaos Knight](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Chaos_Knight)**

Chaos Knight is an agent of chaos. He has the highest natural variance of any hero in the game. All of his attributes and skills incorporate this variance. His stun has a random chance to be a useless 1 second stun at the low end, or a game changing 4 second stun at the high end. Westbrook has similarly high variance, sometimes appearing to be the greatest player on earth as he attacks the rim, runs the floor, and nails every jumper. Other times he seems to shoot his team out of games with brick after brick. The Thunder rise and fall as Westbrook does.

**Manu – [Broodmother](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Broodmother)**

A Broodmother pick at the right time can single-handedly win the game against an unprepared team. Everyone knows what Broodmother brings to the table and yet, there seems to be no way to stop it once she gets going. When used at the right time, she can take over games and leave opponents wondering how they let that happen to them.

**Season Awards**

MVP: Anthony Davis

Rationale: New Orleans only got better after Boogie got injured and that was mostly because of AD. After one season, not much has changed for them - in fact, they look even better on paper after adding Randle and the drop-off from Rondo to Payton isn't that significant, given that they have a similar skill set. If he remains active on both ends of the floor and puts up the same numbers from last year,  New Orleans could become a 50 win team, which should be enough for him to win the award. Harden would be my 2nd pick and Lebron my 3rd. Sleepers: Giannis, Kawhi, Embiid

​

ROY: Marvin Bagley III

Rationale: Bagley is, in my opinion, the most NBA-ready player in his class and as such, I could see him putting up an impressive basic stat-line, which, as we all know, would be enough to impress most sports journalists. Behind Bagley, I have Doncic and Sexton. Sleepers: Ayton, Trae Young, Kevin Knox

​

DPOY:  Kawhi Leonard

Rationale: Kawhi's the best perimeter defender in the league and has joined a team that a top-5 defensive team last season. Regardless of whether or not he stays in Toronto, he has a lot of incentive to play well this year if he wants to get that $$$ and a DPOY award, as well as an All-Team selection, basically guarantees him a max contract. My only concerns about this prediction is his injury and how defensively-oriented Nick Nurse is. I wouldn't say he's the clear front-runner, but I think he's definitely a favorite. Behind him are Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green. Sleepers include Embiid, Giannis, AD.

​

6MOY: Tyreke Evans

Rationale: He's the best player in the league that's on the bench. I would say Lou Williams, but he's kind of streaky and is turning 32 this year. At 2nd and 3rd, I have Lou Williams and Eric Gordon. Sleepers include VanVleet, Kuzma, Rozier.

​

MIP: Dejounte Murray

Rationale:  He's in his  third season, getting major minutes on a perennial playoff team that's coached by Popovich. He already has one All-Defensive team selection under his belt and is only going to get better offensively.  In 2nd place is Brandon Ingram and in 3rd is Jamal Murray. Sleepers include Jabari Parker, Dillon Brooks, Malcolm Brogdon.

​

COTY: Brad Stevens

Rationale: I know he has an excellent roster, probably the 2nd best in the league, to work with but I think he should be judged more on how the kind of system he'll set up for these players to thrive in. Additionally, he's shown himself to be incredibly capable with injury-ridden rosters and is a big reason behind the development of Brown, Rozier and Tatum. At 2nd and 3rd, I have Snyder and Gentry. Sleepers include McMillan, Popovich and Malone.

​

EOTY: Masai Ujiri

Rationale: Full disclosure - I'm a Raptors fan. I've tried to be as objective as possible with my other predictions, so I'm going to indulge on this one and give in to my wishful thinking. If Kawhi signs an extension, trading away DeRozan becomes Ujiri's most significant milestone during his tenure as President of Basketball Operations for the Raptors. In fact, I think it could be considered one of the best trades of the decade.  Behind Masai is Magic and Myers. Sleepers include Morey, Ainge, Presti.

​

Rationale: I'm not an expert on advanced analytics, so these are not ESPN-type standings. I just looked at last year's win-loss records for each team and considered how many wins new players and team personnel could add to that.  I think pretty much everyone can agree that Toronto, Boston and maybe Philly are in a tier of their own in the East, which is why the drop-off is so significant after Philly.

Below are explanations for a few of the team's records.

Boston: Irving-Brown-Hayward-Tatum-Horford with Smart, Rozier, Morris on the bench. I think 60 wins is a bare minimum. A starting lineup composed of an All-Star PG with 4 All-Star caliber wings in their 20s, as well as one of the most versatile defensive centers, is destined to win at least 60 wins in today's league.

Toronto: On paper, they look better than last year so it would make sense for them to increase their win percentage. However, I think chemistry issues and Kawhi's injury concerns will cause them to lose some games. Also, if the coach is smart, he'll rest Kawhi and Lowry during the last during the last 5-8 games of the season, which should cost them a few games.

Philadelphia: Like Boston, they have a young core that's only going to get better, hence the 3 extra wins. However, a lot of this is contingent on Embiid staying healthy and Fultz regaining his shooting form.

Chicago: I know they won less than 30 games last year, but when they had their core of Dunn, Mirotic and Markkannen together, they were a playoff-bound team.  it was only when they got serious about tanking that they looked bad. Add Wendell Carter, Jabari Parker and a healthy Zach LaVine to that lineup and I think you have the makings of another young playoff team.

Cleveland: Only reason I didn't have them lower is because I think Kevin Love is great, Sexton will have a great rookie season and Rodney Hood will make the comeback of the century.

New York: This entirely depends on Kristap's recovery. I actually think they're good enough to make a push for the playoffs and they'll look like it when he comes back, but by then, it'll be too late.

Charlotte: I think they're gonna blow it up this year and trade away Kemba and Batum. Hence, the 30 wins.

Orlando: Someone had to be in last place and, although they have some great franchise pieces in Gordon and Bamba, it seems to me that, out of all the teams in the East, they're the most at peace with being a perennial lottery team for now.

Western Standings

|1. Golden State Warriors|62-20|

|2. Houston Rockets|60-22|

|13. Memphis Grizzlies|33-49|
|14. Phoenix Suns|29-53|
|15. Sacramento Kings|27-55|

GSW: It'll be the same as last year; they'll coast through the regular season, preparing for the playoffs - only this time, they'll do it with Boogie for at least 20-25 games.

HOU: I think losing Ariza and Mbah a Moute will hurt them more than people think, but no significant changes than that,  so 60 wins it is.

DEN: Honestly, they should have won at least this many games last year, had it not been for Millsap's injury and the initial issues with how he fit in the team. I think they'll finally get it together this year and secure their rightful place in the playoffs.

LAL: I would rank them higher, but LeBron seemed to indicate that he was fine waiting for Lonzo, Ingram and Kuzma to fully develop before seriously committing to a championship run.

POR: I think we're approaching the end of the Lillard-McCollum experiment. One of  them is getting traded and the return for either of them won't be enough to keep them in the playoffs.

MIN: Chemistry issues will be the death of this team. That, in addition to Thibodeau's unwillingness to adopt a more modern style of play, will prevent them from staying competitive.

409	Projected Finals MVPs for every year in NBA history	"[Justin Willard of Nylon Calculus has looked at the stats that correlate with winning FMVP.](http://analyticsgame.com/nba/predicting-a-finals-mvp.html)

412	Interview with Phil Handy (talks about Kawhi workout)		nba
413	Who is D'Antoni's more ideal guard? Harden or Curry?	"Two of the best offensive players in the nba, botn today and all-time. Who fits D'Antoni better? 

Harden Advantages: Better slasher to collapse the paint and create open 3s (in the corner specifically).

Better/more tireless iso scorer. 

Better at drawing FTs by a big margin, critical when offense stagnates. 

Better passer (although I think this is closer tha people think), especially on drive/kick.

Can switch onto bigs in the paint on defense and hold his own. 

More durable. 

Curry advantages: More efficient scorer at all 3 levels (Harden's volume at the rim is notably higher though, that area is basically a draw) 

Better gravity on the perimeter, which opens up driving lanes for players/allows higher % shots in the paint. 

Better off-ball, so more effective with another ball-handler, causes more havoc for the defense to create open 3s. 

Plays passing lanes well/better hands to force turnovers.

To this point, appears to have better intangibles. 

Who do you guys think fits D'Antoni's modern offense?"	nba
414	Who should be the Thunder’s primary scoring option: Russell Westbrook or Paul George?	I’ve been seeing posts on Instagram asking; Who should be the Thunder’s primary scoring option: Russell Westbrook or Paul George?	nba
415	Who would you rather have? Murray vs Murray.	Which Murray would you rather have going forward? Jamal or Dejounte? Both promising young guards though they have mostly opposite strengths. DJ of course was an all defensive selection last year, while Jamal is a much more talented offense player.	nba
416	Who do you think will end up higher all-time? Curry or KD?	"In terms of the all time great rankings, where do you think those two will end up? Personally I say Curry will end up higher, if not a spot or two. Durant may be the better player, but in terms of overall greatness and impact on the game, I believe Curry has the edge. I also believe that all time great players must have their own team. What I mean is when you think of a team, you automatically think of that player. Ex. Lebron and Cavs, Jordan and Bulls, Bird and Celtics, Duncan and Spurs, etc. 

While Durant has spent most of his career with the Thunder, the majority of his success has come from the past two years with Curry’s Warriors. Durant won’t have a team associated with him when it’s all said and done, and his career will be unique precedent that is shrouded in controversy and doubt. 

While I’m not saying Curry’s impact on the Warriors isn’t the sole reason he’ll end up higher, it certainly has considerable influence. That and being called the second greatest pg, greatest shooter of all time, first unanimous mvp certainly helps Curry’s case as well.

What do you guys think? Will KD or Curry be higher all time? I personally say Curry. I’d love to hear any counterpoints."	nba

418	What is your ideal triple double statline?	"Triple doubles have been a pretty big buzzword lately with Russ basically getting the MVP over it, and although getting a triple double is a bit overstated right now, it’s still incredibly impressive and can be a huge contribution to a team’s success.

But which aspect of the triple double do value most? Would you rather a player score 50 and get 10 rebounds and assists, or do you think a more well rounded statline is more important towards winning?

Some of the greatest triple double statlines:

**Hakeem Olajuwon** (1990): 29 points, 18 rebounds, 11 blocks, 9 assists

**Shaquille O’Neal** (1993): 24 points, 28 rebounds, 15 blocks (My vote for GOAT triple double)

**Wilt Chamberlain** (1968): 22 points, 25 rebounds, 21 assists

**Fat Lever** (1988): 31 points, 16 rebounds, 20 assists, 6 steals (Did you know Far Lever is 6th all time in triple doubles?)

**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar** (1975): 50 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists 

**Russell Westbrook** (2017): 57 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists"	nba

423	As a championship contender (think Rockets, Raptors Celtics etc.) who is the worst player you would rather have than the option of taking one of Klay/Draymond off the Warriors?	"For example, would you rather add Giannis to your team or remove one of Klay or Draymond from the Warriors?

Would you rather add Butler to your team or remove one of Klay or Draymond? What about Embiid? Davis? Etc. 


Note: The Warriors due to their cap situation wouldn't be able to sign someone to replace the player you take off their roster.

Edit: For the purposes of making the discussion interesting let's say the player you add can't be Draymond or Klay. Otherwise you get to cheat and simultaneously improve your team and weaken the Warriors.

The question is supposed to be a tradeoff between improving your team and weakening the Warriors.

429	I wouldn't be surprised to see Durant switch teams next Summer	"Assume the 5-star Warriors super-team wins the title.  Steph/Klay/Draymond will now have 4 titles.  Durant will have 3.  

I just think at some point the guy is going to want to add another layer to his legacy.  

The obvious team to keep an eye out on is the Lakers and their max cap space.  Some think they'll use it on Kawhi.  Others think Klay is a possibility.  I think we should take the possibility of Durant seriously.

Think about it ... Durant and LeBron will both have 3 titles.  Teaming up to try and surpass Steph/Klay/Draymond's 4 would be a hell of a story for the league.  Perhaps Durant would sign a 3 year contract to align with LeBron.   After those 3 seasons they could potentially both have 6 titles.  At that point, Bron probably joins whatever team drafts Bronnie and maybe 34 year old Durant joins an expansion Sonics team or something to end his story on a feel-good note.

It would also be interesting for the legacy of Steph/Klay and Draymond.  Even without Durant, that's a 73 win team perfectly capable of winning titles.  They'd likely still be a contender - possibly even the frontrunner.  If they managed to win another one in spite of Durant/Bron teaming up, it would cement their legacy as one of the greatest trios in NBA history.

It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.

What google tells me as of right now he’s 7 foot. 245 "	nba
431	If the best 13 players in the league abandoned their own teams to form a super super-team, would they be able to win a championship if they were only allowed four players on the court at once?	"Let's say the league were to create an expansion team that would play in the Eastern conference. This team could draft any thirteen players from any teams it wanted with no protections, however it could only let four players on the court at a time.

The current warriors super-team would probably be stripped of at least three players and would no longer be a major contender. LeBron would obviously be taken from the Lakers, Kyrie probably from the Celtics (even if he's not top 13, it would help to neutralize Boston as a threat), and Harden from the Rockets. So essentially, would an absolute death squad of LeBron, Steph, KD, AD (or some other combo) with the ability to draw from the 5th-13th best players for its subs be able to beat the remaining teams in the league despite being perpetually short one player?

Additionally, if you were forming this team, which other players would you pick more for the purposes of weakening other potential contenders than for actually improving your team? And if this new super-team didn't win, which remaining team would be the championship favorite?

432	MVP Derrick Rose had the filthiest lay-up package the NBA has ever seen. Change my mind	"I don’t think any player in the NBA ever topped Derrick Rose’s variety of finishes and the speed at which he could execute them. 

Kyrie and Steph have pretty nice layup packages, but I have never seen them do anything around the rim that prime Derrick Rose couldn’t. He had the touch, floaters, reverses, underhand, crafty moves, dreamshakes etc. - but could also straight up finish overtop of almost any player in the league, whether it was taking the contact in the air and finishing like butter regardless, fully extending and perfectly releasing the ball at ridiculous points of the backboard with perfect backspin, or just banging on players heads.

Change my mind.

What is it about Kobe's game that can't be captured in this stat, and why does it match the eye test narrative for Jordan, LeBron, and Kareem so well? Freakish coincidence? Luck? What are your thoughts?

There have been 16 different series of playoff runs since then. I thought it would be interesting to try to create the best possible offensive playoff run by pulling from the playoff highs in **PPG, Assists per Game, and TS%**,...and then comparing it to Lebron's best playoff runs

**The rules are:**

1. A player must play a minimum of **10** games in a playoff run, and a minimum of **30 mpg.**  Also, he must average a minimum of **25 ppg** to at least make it somewhat interesting.
2. The highest stat that I will pull from **cannot be from Lebron**

Here are my results. There were are a total of 49 different playoff runs over this 16 year span to choose from **not from Lebron.**

470	The Lowest Scoring Game in NBA History	"Didn't see this up when I posted earlier, so I'm reposting it:

Thought I'd do this as a follow up to my original post, The Highest Scoring Game in NBA History.

On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons were matched up with the defending NBA champions, the Minneapolis Lakers. The Pistons coach knew he didn't have a lineup that could compete with the Lakers, who had won their last 29 games at home behind the dominant play of star George Mikan, so he ordered his team to stall. Despite their tactics, the Pistons were down 13-11 at the end of the half, and 17-14 after 3 periods. Despite only scoring 1 point in the whole fourth, the Lakers led late, till rookie Larry Foust cut to the basket on an inbounds pass and layed it in over Mikan with 6 seconds left in the game, to give the Pistons a stunning 19-18 victory. Mikan scored 15 of his team's 18 points (83.3%) on 4 of 11 shooting, while his teammates shot 0 for 6 from the field.

471	Charles Barkley with 0.5 seconds left.	"On April 22, 1993, playing their 3rd to last game of the regular season, the Phoenix Suns were locked in a close game against the Trail Blazers. Down 1 point with half a second left in the game, coach Paul Westphal drew up a desperate last second play. Westphal had 6' 9"" forward [Oliver Miller](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/oliver-miller-of-the-sacramento-kings-during-the-game-against-the-picture-id470128485) throw an inbound pass from the sideline off the backboard, telling the Suns in their huddle that the Trail Blazers would stop playing, thinking the game was over. After setting a decoy screen, Barkley would circle around, pick up the ball, and shoot.

[The play somehow worked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFe-71tNPQk)

Barkley won MVP and the Suns made it all the way to the finals before losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. This is still one of the craziest NBA plays I have ever seen."	nba

473	Suns PG acquisitions: tier 1 (Kyrie), tier 2 (Dragic), or tier 3 (Russell)?	"These are the three most logical targets for the Suns imo.  All ECF PGs, so the teams are more willing to deal with each other (they aren’t directly competing for playoff bids).  

1.  Kyrie would be the Celtics attempting to do the Nets trade 2.0.  Kyrie for Tyson Chandler, Mikal Bridges, the Suns unprotected 2020 first rounder, and a 2021 pick swap. 

Suns lose zero pieces from their current core, and acquire a bonafide star to save their GMs job in this apparent ‘progress or bust’ season.

Celtics drop $4M in payroll to duck the luxury tax, and acquire 3 pieces for an eventual Anthony Davis or Giannis pursuit, and they make their rotation minutes clearer, and they avoid the awful decision of overpaying Kyrie or losing him for nothing.   

2.  Dragic.  We know he doesn’t want to be in PHX, so even though that is the rumored deal, I find it less plausible than the one below.  

3.  D-Lo.  This is the one I predict.  He’s cheap for salary matching ($7M in his final year of his rookie deal).  He should require the least talent in return from the Suns (in other words, Kyrie and Dragic will require a greater sum in return).  Russell is also best friends with Devin Booker.  Lastly, the Nets might want to get something in return for D-Lo now, since it helps their plan of keeping two max salary slots open for next summer.  D-Lo’s cap hold is too high to keep him on the books and recruit a max FA tandem (like Kyrie and Butler).  

I predict one of these 3 guys will be the Suns opening day PG.  In order of likelihood:  D-Lo, then Dragic, then Kyrie is the pie-in-the-sky option."	nba
474	Toughest divisions in the NBA this upcoming season?	"The Southwest used to be the toughest, but with Dallas and Memphis rebuilding it's pretty much left only the Rockets, Spurs, and Pelicans as playoff caliber teams.

The Pacific is Golden State, then the Lakers, then everyone else, with the Clippers being a bit above the Suns and Kings.

The Northwest has all playoff caliber teams, but none of them are 50 win contenders, though Oklahoma City might come close.

The Central has declined from its glory days, though Milwaukee is roaring back to relevance behind Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Southeast is probably the most irrelevant division right now.

I think the Atlantic is the toughest this year. Three teams which could make the Finals if the cards fall their way, a hungry Nets team that, even if they don't win a lot of games, will be a tough one to play every night, and even the Knicks aren't as dismal as other teams.

Anyone in NBA history with more than 7?  This does not include shots that happened with more than 5 seconds left, or shots that tied the game.  If it did, Vince would have several more.  In my quick and lazy research, Kobe doesn't have 7 (he does have more mid-range game winners).  Ray Allen comes close, but many of his clutchest shots happened with around 10 seconds left, or tied the game.

All told, I think Vince's lack of playoff success is to often confused with him somehow being unclutch.  Dude has ice in his veins when it came to game winning shots (outside that Philly game, of course...)"	nba

489	in the 1968 NBA season when Wilt Chamberlain lead the league in total assists, he would not pass to hof teammate Chet Walker because of the assist rules from back then where if you dribbled or faked a shot the passer would not get a assist.	"testimonials from two of wilts teammates from that season, [Billy Cunningham](https://books.google.com/books?id=9BaqPfGcI84C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=wilt+was+very+goal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWm-_qrprdAhXJY98KHVj_AV4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wilt%20was%20very%20goal&amp;f=false) and [Matt Guokas](http://www.nba.com/2012/history/features/01/09/season-of-giants-part3/) (there is no link to the paragraph from this article i'm about to show, just control+f the paragraph on that page)


Billy Cunningham:

 ""Wilt is a very goal-oriented person, and and under Alex (Hannum) he wanted to win a title and become the first center to lead the league in assists. He liked to pass to Hal Greer or myself, because we just caught it and shot it. Chet Walker usually caught the ball, took a dribble or two and then shot it - no assist for Wilt (under the assist rules of that time). So Wilt preferred to give the ball to us.""

Matt Guokas: 

""He said in training camp that he wanted to lead the league in assists. He thought that would be cool. Of course, we all thought that would be cool too. But he didn't want us to run. He wouldn't throw outlet passes off rebounds. Only Billy or Chet were allowed to run out and score on the fastbreak if they got long rebounds.

""Wilt wanted to be involved in every half-court play, so he stood there in the middle and all of us would run around him and he tried to pile up his assists. You've got to remember that assists were kept much more strictly back then. There was none of this stuff like today where you can take three dribbles and a head-fake and it counts. You got assists if you caught the pass and made the shot. So that meant Wilt would only pass it to guys who could catch and shoot -- Luke, Billy sometimes, Wali, Hal and me. In my case, he'd try to get me to just go backdoor for a layup, because he didn't trust me to do much else. And he'd never pass it to Chet Walker, because Chet always had to be pump-faking or use a dribble and take away the assist.""


Chet's numbers did not drop much despite Wilt not passing to him on offense. His ppg average only dropped by 1.4, and he actually took 22 more shot attempts throughout the regular season."	nba

3 fewer points, 2 fewer assists, and 3 more rebounds on considerably better efficiency.

492	What Magic and Pelinka were able to do in two years has been nothing short of great	"This was the roster when they came:
https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2017.html

In 1.5 year period, they improved their young core and assets while getting rid of both bad contracts. They also signed Lebron James for the max, and now have space for another max contract.

The only guys left from that roster are Brandon Ingram and Ivica Zubac. "	nba
493	Now that both stints are over, who was the more impressive player: Miami LeBron, or 2nd Cleveland-stint LeBron?	"There seems to be a consensus that 2013 LeBron was the best LeBron, but his most recent post-season run was the best I've ever seen him for a sustained period of time.

Not to mention the 2017 Finals where he averaged a triple double. And also not to mention the 2016 post-season run, which we all know included the legendary defeat of the Warriors.

I mean there's no question that he was more of a physical freak of nature during the Miami stint, but after following both stints closely, I really think what he lost in physicality, he more than made up for in other facets (post-game, playmaking, intangibles, general BBIQ, clutchness). It really seemed like anytime the Cavs needed to get bailed out by LeBron, he would just pull it off no matter what (yeah unless it was against the warriors with KD but hey).

501	Comparing Lebron's top 3 offensive playoff runs with those of the greats	"What I want to achieve here is a comparison of ""peak"", offensive playoff Lebron with the peaks of the best scorers/offensive players of all time. I think 3 playoff runs is enough to qualify as peak. For some people, 2 may be enough as well. Just 1 playoff run is too small of a sample size to legitimately qualify as the entirety of someone's peak for me though.

​

For this I'm going to look at playoff runs with a **minimum of 3 series played**. 2 playoff runs is only half the conceivable length of the playoffs, and is most often in the 6-11 game range. A sample size of say 8 or 9 games is ridiculously small relative to long playoff runs, in which people end up playing 15+ games. A playoff run with at least 3 series played generally ends up being a considerably larger fraction of the playoffs.

​

# Lebron:

1. *2008-2008:* **35 ppg, 9 rebounds, 7 assists on 61.8 % TS** (14 games)
2. *2016-2017:* **32.8 ppg, 9 rebounds, 8 assists on 64.9 % TS** (18 games)
3. *2017-2018:* **34 ppg, 9 rebounds, 9 assists on 61.9 % TS** (22 games)

​

***Average:*** **33.9 ppg, 9 rebounds, 8.1 assists** on **62.7 % TS**

​

# Jordan

1. *1989-1990:* **36.7 ppg, 7 rebounds, 6.8 assists on 59.2 % TS** (16 games)
2. *1988-1989:* **34.8 ppg, 7 rebounds, 7.6 assists on 60 % TS** (17 games)
3. *1991-1992*: **34.5 ppg, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists on 57 % TS** (22 games)

***Average:*** **35.9 ppg, 6.8 rebounds, 6.8 assists** on **58.7 % TS**

​

# Kareem

1. *1973-1974*: **32.2 ppg, 16 rebounds, 5 assists, on 58 % TS** (16 games)
2. *1979-1980*: **31.9 ppg, 12 rebounds, 3 assists on 61 % TS** (15 games)
3. *1969-1970*: **35.2 ppg, 17 rebounds, 4 assists on 60.8 % TS** (10 games).

The reason I have included Kareem's 1970 playoff run despite only playing 10 games(2 series), is that teams could only play a maximum of 3 playoff series during that time, not 4. So Kareem still played the majority of the playoffs.

***Average:*** **32.8 ppg, 14.7 rebounds, 4 assists,** on **60 % TS**

​

# Shaq

1. *1999-2000:* **30.7 ppg, 15.4 rebounds, 3 assists on 55.6 % TS** (23 games)
2. *2000-2001:* **30.4 ppg, 15.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists on 58 % TS** (16 games)
3. *1997-1998:* **30.5 ppg, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists on 60.4 % TS** (13 games)

***Average***: **30.6 ppg**, **14.1 rebounds, 3 assists** on **57.5% TS**

​

# Kobe

1. *2007-2008*: **30.1 ppg, 5.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists on 57.8 % TS** (21 games)
2. *2008-2009*: **30.2 ppg, 5.3 rebounds, 5.5 assists on 56.5 % TS** (23 games)
3. *2009-2010:* **29.2 ppg, 6 rebounds, 5.5 assists on 57 % TS** (23 games)

***Average:*** **29.8 ppg, 5.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists** on **57 % TS**

​

# Durant

1. *2011-2012*: **28.5 ppg, 7.4 rebounds, 3.7 assists on 63 % TS** (20 games)
2. *2016-2017:* **28.5 ppg, 7.9 rebounds, 4.3 assists on 68.3 % TS** (15 games)
3. *2017-2018*: **29 ppg, 7.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists on 60.5 % TS** (21 games)

In 28 minutes off the bench, Marshall dropped 38-10-3, shooting 13 of 22 from the field and a scorching 12 of 19 from beyond the arc. He did this despite averaging less than one triple a game for his entire career. Curry and Kobe played 38 and 37 minutes respectively in the games where they had 12 3's. Curry did eventually break the record with 13 3's in a game against the Pelicans, one game after going 0 for 10 from 3. Another insane fact about Donyell, he is just 1 of 11 players to ever rack up 10,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, 750 3-pointers and 750 blocks.

After watching these games I realized how much I don’t like watching switching defense. Watching Kobe and other players go against their matchup every time was great to watch develop throughout the game. 


Now half the time on offense teams just try to get a switch for a mismatch. Not as exciting watching Steph Curry or Harden try and crossover Stephen Adams. You already know what’s gonna happen 9 times out of 10. 


Or watching the Cavs PG last season set a ball screen for LeBron, hold his man just so he can get guarded by the opposing PG. no shit he’s just gonna bully him to the rack or shoot a short fade over him every time. 


Switching is obviously a legitimate strategy that most teams use bc they thinks it’s the best option. It allows to stop their defense from scrambling to defend the p&amp;r. Just not fun to watch for me at all, hope a new strategy comes up soon. Seems like we’ve gone from hedging puck and rolls, to sinking, now everything is switched"	nba

Feels like center ratings are volatile, we can't read too much into the playoffs because of team composition but KAT, Gobert where a shell of themselves playoffs, no doubt they'll eat again regular season. Jokic is very much loved, but he's a 1 way player, his assist ability helps boost him. Out East, Embiid has climbed the ranking cos of his healthy season, same reason why we can't be putting Boggie top 5 cos we don't know what he is right now. Guys like Drummond put up numbers but it never translates to Ws, wheras a guy like Al Horford may not have the numbers but Celtic fans will tell you he's the most important piece who brings it all together and he gets the Ws. Who you got?	nba
522	"""all of these guys are friends with each other off court"", do you really believe that?"	Just because Kyrie adores hanging out with the GSW crew (chilling with Durant this offseason, making fun of Lebron with Curry the year before) and Draymond Green doesn't take any of the stuff seriously (I do believe he doesn't hate anyone in the league), do you really believe all the A/B status players in the league like each other?	nba

524	NBA players and their Metal Gear Solid equivalents	"Metal Gear Solid is possibly the greatest videogame series of all time. Its cinematic blend of action, stealth, and Japanese-flavored weirdness has absolutely nothing to do with the NBA, but neither does [Dark Souls](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9b41re/nba_players_dark_souls_boss_equivalents/). So, here are the Metal Gear Solid equivalents of NBA players.

​

SPOILERS: if you plan on playing any Metal Gear Solid game, then come back when you've finished. There will be many spoilers below and you don't want to see them.

​

[**Big Boss**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Boss) \- **Michael Jordan** \- The GOAT. After surviving Soviet GRU soldiers (Bad Boy Pistons), defeating the Cobra Unit (Late 80s Celtics), and finally killing his mentor, The Boss (Magic Johnson), he became a legend and earned the title of Big Boss. He's also kind of an asshole at times.

[**Venom Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Venom_Snake) \- **""The Black Mamba"" Kobe ""Vino"" Bryant** \- The non-genetic clone of Big Boss' appearance and abilities. One of the greatest ever, but he never reached the level of Big Boss. He embraces his role as the villain. He's also kind of an asshole at times.

[**The Boss (The Joy)**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Boss) \- **Magic Johnson** \- Revolutionized combat. She paved the way for all the soldiers who came after her. She was also very team-first and selfless, but could dominate any situation if necessary. Was also code-named ""The Joy,"" probably because she has 5-Star smile [like this](https://www.google.fi/search?q=magic+johnson+smiling&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSvcyIkpbdAhWIh1QKHcF4A4cQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=763). Defeated by Big Boss at the end of Operation Snake Eater ('91 NBA Finals).

[**Zero**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Zero) \- **Danny Ainge** \- The grand architect. A decent soldier who grows to eventually become the Root of All Evil. He is obsessed with controlling the world and has no loyalty beyond that end. Everybody, rightfully, hates him.

[**EVA**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/EVA) \- **Scottie Pippen** \- The surrogate mother of the Sons of Big Boss. What happens when you get the Perfect combination of Jordan/Pippen? See below.

​

**The Cobra Unit** \- **Late 80s Celtics**

[**The End**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_End) \- Larry ""Leg-End"" Bird - Legendary sniper who is reduced to a wheelchair when not in battle. The End is reeaaaally old, so let's say he's in the wheelchair because of back problems.

[**The Fear**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Fear) \- Kevin McHale - Defenders feared McHale's legendary ""Torture Chamber.""

[**The Sorrow**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sorrow) \- Bill Walton -  Can communicate with the dead. Probably a skill Bill Walton has too.

​

**GRU** \- **Bad Boy Pistons**

[**Revolver Ocelot**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Revolver_Ocelot) \- **Dennis Rodman** \- former enemy, then close ally of Big Boss (MJ). His flashy personality during battle and willingness to work behind the scenes with no recognition has led many to forget how truly great he was. In his later years, he allies himself with his own enemy (Kim Jong-un) in order to Save the World , even if it means he will die a villain.

[**Volgin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Yevgeny_Borisovitch_Volgin) \- Bill Laimbeer - the big guy

[**Raikov**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Ivan_Raidenovitch_Raikov) \- ~~Isaiah~~  Isiah Thomas - the little guy. Incidentally also Volgin's secret lover.

[**Granin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Aleksandr_Leonovitch_Granin) \- Chuck Daly - The architect of the organization. He first conceived of the super-weapon ""[Shagohod](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Shagohod)"" (the Jordan Rules). It would eventually be transformed into the ""[Metal Gear](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_(weapon)),"" a bipedal nuclear tank.

​

**Sons of Big Boss**

[**Solid Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solid_Snake) **- Russel Westbrook -** An imperfect clone of Big Boss. A pure soldier who only cares about completing the mission and the occasional smoke.

Solid Snake's allies - 2019 OKC:

[**Jonathan**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Jonathan) \- Steven Adams - The muscle.

[**Hal Emmerich / Otacon**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Hal_Emmerich) \- Billy Donovan - The brains. Helps out a lot but is clearly second banana to Solid Snake.

[**Drebin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Drebin_893) \- Paul George - An ally out of necessity at first. Eventually proves to be trustworthy.

​

[**Liquid Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Liquid_Snake) **- Kevin Durant -** Another imperfect clone of Big Boss. He is Solid Snake's [BROTHER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o72FGjCgUX8) and bitter rival. He cares too much about what Big Boss thinks of him and wants to make him proud by taking over the world, by any means. He assembles a very talented crew for that purpose, (the similarities end here) but is defeated by Solid Snake.

Liquid's allies - 2019 GSW:

[**Sniper Wolf**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Sniper_Wolf) \- Stephen Curry - Perhaps the greatest shooter ever.

[**Vulcan Raven**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Vulcan_Raven) \- Draymond Green - wise but always angry. His armor and heavy weapons makes him effective at defense.

[**Psycho Mantis**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Psycho_Mantis) \- Andre Iguodala - a psychic. Can anticipate his opponent's next move (i.e. high BBIQ).

[**Fortune**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Fortune) \- Shaun Livingston - Extremely lucky, so she can never die. Kind of like how Livingston's had a successful career, despite the injuries.

[**Fatman**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Fatman) \- Javale McGee - A joke character. (I know he's not a warrior anymore).

[**Vamp**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Vamp) \- Klay Thompson - idk how they are equivalent, but I can't leave out both Vamp and Klay.

​

[**Solidus Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solidus_Snake) **- LeBron James -** A perfect clone of Big Boss. Eventually becomes President of the US. LeSnake is defeated by Raiden.

​

**Other Characters**

[**Raiden**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Raiden) \- Giannis A... - Young and counted out. Eventually becomes a badass Cyborg Ninja (a ""unicorn"").

[**Gray Fox**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Gray_Fox) \- Ben Simmons - A promising soldier who seemingly dies, then comes back as another badass Cyborg Ninja.

[**Master Kazuhira Miller**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Kazuhira_Miller) \- Grant Hill - A highly skilled soldier who suffered major injuries, but continues to be effective in a reduced role.

[**Skullface**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Skull_Face) \- Reggie Miller - Constantly thwarted by Big Boss. Is eventually defeated for good by Venom Snake. Also **Horrifically Ugly** .

[**Quiet**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Quiet) \- Peja Stojakovic -  Deadly Sniper who can't speak English. (I'm sure Peja can speak English, but I just chose the best international shooter that came to mind). [Here is what Peja might look like in Quiet cosplay.](https://www.google.com/search?q=borat+swimming+suit&amp;rlz=1C1LEND_enUS507US512&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK6ImCn5jdAhVLz1QKHRvtD9AQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=763) (Maybe NSFW?)

[**Huey Emmerich**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Huey_Emmerich) \- Phil Jackson - Was the lead engineer/scientist for both Big Boss (MJ) and Venom Snake (Kobe). Helped perfect the concept of the [Metal Gear weapon](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_(weapon)) (the Triangle Offense).

[**Sunny**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Sunny_Emmerich) \- Steve Kerr - a relative youngster who creates a [weapon](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/FOXALIVE) to surpass Metal Gear (Pace and Space Offense)

525	Help me understand this	How is LeBron blocking Jimmy Butler’s attempting shot in end of Wolves vs Cavs then LeBron clutching to win the game few minutes later ... best play of this year? NBA posted the number one play of year and it was that. Don’t get me wrong, I’m LeBron’s biggest fan but I cannot put finger to it. I could think of few other plays being better than that. Was it because Cavs were going downhill and they needed to see bright light? 	nba

My pick is Joe Ingles.

If you're feeling generous, give me your starting 5 of these type of players.

Edit: We'll define a rotation player as someone that averages at least 12 minutes of playing time but isn't an all-star caliber player.

Applaud him for everything he does to make himself good enough and like he had nothing else to accomplish at GSW. We need to call all 14 year olds to get on twitter and give him complements until there are no more haters on his TL. I believe this will be the best strategy fans can use to get him out of GSW and restore the competitive balance in the NBA.
I’m going to go first: 
KD if you’re reading this... don’t ever get a haircut or brush your hair. It is perfect as it is. Everyone got their own style, nappy just happens to be yours. Be comfortable in your own skin, until you shed into a new one. Have a great year KD."	nba

537	[NPR - How I Built This Podcast] Mark Cuban insinuates his relationship with the refs probably cost him a championship in 2006	"Guy Raz (host): 

'Do you cause trouble for fun or do you just do it because you like to fight?'

Mark Cuban: 

'Just depends on the circumstance, If I'm playing pick up or I'm playing in the league, I'm never arguing over calls. If I'm in a league and there's a bad call ok that's the way it goes. In the NBA it's a lot different particularly when I first got there. When I first got to the NBA refs really worked at managing the game rather than calling the game by the rule back. **I remember early on reading something from the Director of Officiating back then who said we don't call the game the same in the last minute as we do in the first minute. Which just enfuriated me to no end and then from their it was like ok I'm on a mission to make this fair and it set me off with a lot of those guys and probably cost me a championship in 2006** but it's come a long way since and I think I'm better for it and the NBA is better for it.'

541	What do you guys/girls think about Andrew wiggins career so far, and what do you expect for him this upcoming year.	For me wiggins really hasn't met a lot of peoples expectations of being a phenom, instead his been quite disappointed. Based on the fact he hasn't been a good defender, isn't a good playmaker nor a good 3rd option. He seems better as a n1 or n2 option on a bad team, but on a playoff team that has Towns and butler. He didn't fit well last year, I expect him to at least this upcoming year to be more of an off ball scorer threat. As well as a consistent defender, his shown moments and stretches he can be good defensively. But other stretches he looks worse than most bad defenders in the league.	nba
542	Realistically, what could Al Horford do to escape the Hall of Very Good?	"Current Notable Accolades:

5x All Star

Back-to-back NCAA Champion

1x All NBA Third Team

1x All Defense Second Team

&amp;nbsp;

It could be difficult for Al to get another All-Star berth without being an injury replacement. Lebron and DeRozan left, Porzingis won't make it, but on the other hand Kawhi will take a spot and most likely Simmons and Griffin as well. On his own team, Hayward could take one of the frontcourt spots assuming his health. That was just for next season but after that Al will probably take a lesser role on the team.

All-NBA would be very difficult but another All-Defense team isn't out of the question. The Celtics have continuity on their side and the defense will most likely stay elite.

Al's team playoff success has been decent (major piece in 10 series wins and 10 series losses) but is a championship realistic with Al as the 2nd/3rd best player? And when his role is reduced down the line will the ring mean as much as the 4th/5th best player?

&amp;nbsp;

Unless he wins a title, the rare B2B college chips would probably be the most impressive thing on his resume. That wouldn't be enough to squeeze into the HoF so some more deep playoff runs is mandatory."	nba
543	The Most Inspirational Moment in Finals History	"The 1970 NBA Finals was one of the greatest finals series of all time. The Lakers were fresh off a painful Game 7 loss in the 1969 Finals, while the New York Knicks stormed into the finals with a 60-22 record. Game 1 went to the Knicks while Game 2 went to the Lakers. The Knicks appeared to have Game 3 wrapped up, but Jerry West hit a 60 footer at the buzzer to tie the game, a moment that has been immortalized today as, ""The Shot."" It wasn't enough to prevent New York from winning Game 3. The Lakers took Game 3, while the Knicks won Game 5. However, Knicks star center Willis Reed suffered a severe thigh injury in Game 5 and a torn muscle kept him out of Game 6, where the Lakers cruised to an easy 22 point victory. Due to the severity of his torn muscle, Reed was considered unlikely to play in Game 7 at the Madison Square Garden. Reed decided to try to get an injection for the pain so he could play. However, his skin was so thick that the doctor had trouble even getting the needle in. When Reed managed to hobble over to where the Knicks were warming up, the Garden roared in delight. Knicks starting forward Dave DeBuscherre thought, ""There is no place in the world I would rather be right now."" Reed scored New York's first 4 points, his only points of the game, and held Wilt to 2 of 9 shooting. By the time he left, with 3:05 in the first half, New York was up 61-37. Walt Frazier finished with 36 points and 19 assists, as the Knicks won 113-99. Reed was named Finals MVP, and in the locker room afterward, an emotionally moved Howard Cosell told Reed,""You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer."""	nba
544	How popular is basketball outside of the USA?	It seems like basketball is much more popular in the USA (where I live) than Europe and the rest of the world.

552	"""Legit"" Rings vs ""Not Legit"" Rings - help me understand and lay out criteria. (Serious)"	"So i hear the sentiment of KD ring not being legit. I am not posting to argue for or against that statement - however because it is so common want to dig a little further and am wondering what criteria would have to be met for rNBA to say a ring is ""not legit"" and what each persons threshold is. I think the extremes are pretty obvious - where a team is clearly led by 1 person (03 duncan, 11 Dirk) vs created superteams whether by free agency (Miami/2nd stint Cle Lebron, Warriors KD, 2000 lakers Shaq) or trades (Boston). I also realize that this may be less black/white and more of a grey scale - so then I pose the question what factors do you take into account that tip the scales one way or another (Ex. If you think KDs championships in GS mean less the Lebrons in Miami because he joined a better team. But think Lebrons in Miami mean less the Dirks or Duncans because he joined a super team etc etc etc). Personally i believe every championship is legit which is why i find this subjective weighting of chips so interesting.  

PS - do not say joining a 73 win team you had a 3-1 lead on unless you believe that meeting those criteria are the ONLY way for a ring not to be legit. "	nba

560	Trying To Fix The WNBA	"With many WNBA players coming out and asking for higher wages, many basketball fans have had the chance to express their thoughts about the WNBA. From what I've read, it seems that most NBA fans find the more fundamentally-sound style of WNBA play to be boring, giving the league less viewership, and in turn, less revenue. Today, I'm gonna try to come up with some hypothetical rule changes to the WNBA thats would make games more exciting and help to differentiate the league further from the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

1. 20 Second Shot Clock

When I have tried to watch WNBA games, my biggest gripe is how slowly the game seems to be played. Shortening the shot clock would incentivize running offenses at faster paces, which would naturally lead to more exciting play.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Lower Rims

&amp;#x200B;

WNBA player, on average, are 7 inches shorter than NBA players. Despite this, both leagues use 10 foot tall hoops. I believe lowering the rims would allow for more dunks and alley oops, two of the most electrifying plays in basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

3. 3 point alley oops

&amp;#x200B;

This one's simple enough. Make alley oops worth 3 points in an attempt to incentivize them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these rule changes wouldn't completely revitalize the WNBA and aren't perfect, but I believe they would go a long way towards making the league more entertaining and profitable."	nba

565	Thanos Snaps the NBA: The Los Angeles Clippers	"Again, to clarify my methods. There is a 50% chance that a player will be snapped (killed) by Thanos. This time I used random.org to determine if a player survived.

Snapped: Marcin Gortat, Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Wesley Johnson, Boban Marjonovic, Sindarius Thornwell, Johnathan Motley

Survivors: Tobias Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Milos Teodosic, Jawun Evans, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jerome Robinson, Angel Delgado, Avery Bradley, Mike Scott, Luc Mbah a Moute, Montrezl Harrell

Losing Beverly, Williams, and Gortat aren't fun, but I feel like the Clippers walk away from this snap in a better place than they were pre-snap.  This team clearly isn't a world-beater, but they have depth at every position except maybe center, though you could slide into a 3F small lineup if needed (especially considering how many centers have been snapped across the league). If Shai can't handle the starting Guard spot, Teodosic can fill in just fine. I think this team can sneak into the playoffs as a 8 seed, assuming the West doesn't fill out with post-snap powerhouses.

Position | Player
---|---
G | Gilgeous-Alexander
G | Avery Bradley
F| Gallinari
F | Harris
C| Harrell
6 | Mbah a Moute

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6xatsp/grading_zach_lowes_30_predictions_for_the/dmeyue7/

in fact i totally forgot I did this......

So how did they come around?

1. Golden state repeats -- yep
2. James Harden wins MVP -- yep
3. cavs win east -- my theory is ""you choose a team with lebron to win the east until proven otherwise"". Well this definitely won't be the case this year, but history has shown that a eastern team with lebron has a great chance to win the conference, no matter how they look
4. Rudy Gobert win DPOY -- yep
5. Charlotte goes up 4 spots for pt per possession -- i actually don't know how to check this. The best I could find was offense ranking, which Charlotte only went up one spot
6. Derrick Rose plays more than 41 games -- yep. he played 50 games total
7. Lonzo Ball wins rookie of the year -- well, even without ben simmons, mitchell will get that spot, then tatum? Lonzo had no chance
8. Utah still somehow manages to win 50 -- 48 - 34 was good but not good enough to make this prediction come true
9. McDermott time! Wins most improved player!!!! -- okay this didn't happen......
10. Carmelo Anthony gets traded in Feb, not before season starts -- hoodie melo was a short-lived legend

so the result was 5 for 10, but some of them are not even that crazy. I'll need to try harder this year.

573	Those who watched Stockton play, do you agree with this characterization of his play?	"&gt; He was listed at 6-foot-1, but played even smaller. He was bothered by larger defenders and struggled among the trees, both with his vision and scoring. He was even hesitant to enter the lane at times because he had a hard time scoring or passing when in there

&gt; Unlike all offensive forces in history, Stockton rarely took the attack to his man. He was more Rajon Rondo than Steve Nash, often pounding the ball while options materialized out of Utah’s off-ball screens. 

&gt; He could architect brilliant plays, but only occasionally. 

&gt; Overall, he was a very good, but not great passer. He uncorked a number of quality assists per game, but he missed too many elite passes. 

&gt; On defense, Stockton’s rotations were excellent. He used his quickness to overcome a size disadvantage, ping-ponging from one advantageous spot to another, darting to help-the-helper when needed.

&gt; Stockton was also an expert at sniping the post.

&gt; However, his size prevented him from bothering bigger players. Larger guards like Terry Porter fared well against him, backing him into the post where he was vulnerable. 

&gt; Stockton’s inability to pressure opponents and create havoc in the lane significantly dampened his impact as an offensive dynamo. Great players don’t have to score, but their threat to score generates global impact. Stockton simply wasn’t capable of this. 

&gt; The playoffs exposed these weaknesses in Stockton.

&gt; Stockton’s regular season efficiency is deceptive. He wasn’t an unstoppable force like Shaq, nor did he gain an advantage with marksmanship like Reggie Miller or Steph Curry. Instead, his efficiency was fueled by conservatism — he shot well because he only took premium shots. 


&gt; Passing like Stockton’s can be additive, it’s not game-changing. And while his shooting scales well, he was reluctant to fire open shots. 

&gt; Still, his consistency was exceptional. For a decade, he ticked like a metronome, clocking out nearly identical seasons every year. "	nba

586	Game on the Line - which players would you pick to take the Full-Court Heave, 3, Mid-Range, 3-Footer, Dunk or FT?	"This randomly popped in my head and it got me thinking about which players I would pick with the game on the line, absolutely needing a bucket. 

You can choose a player from any era and it's assumed they are in their prime when they take the shot.

Here's my list:

Full Court Heave - I'm taking Steph from 2016. Dude was an absolute beast at hitting those shots that season and I can't think of anyone else i'd rather have.

3-Pointer - A little more tricky because their are so many good 3 point specialists. I'm gonna throw a curveball however and pick Larry Fucking Bird. Game on the line, i'm betting Larry Legend shit talks the opposing team before drilling the 3 in their face.

Mid-Range - Gotta be the GOAT Michael Jordan. We saw it in 1998, we saw it in 1989, if the game is on the line and you need a mid range from anywhere on the court you'd be a fool to not take MJ.

3-Footer - Gotta be Kareem and his sky-hook. Most unblockable, unstoppable shot in the history of the game. 

Dunk - This was tough but I think i'd take Shaq in 2001. What a beast, if he absolutely needed a dunk to seal the game (lets hope he's not fouled and has to hit FT's) I think Shaq would deliver during his prime.

FT's - Another one for MJ. Game on the line I wouldn't want anyone else taking those FT's. Yea, his % isn't the highest but its not about that. He wanted to hit the FT to rip your heart out.

That's it - what do ya'll think?"	nba

The Lakers had been on a 7-game losing streak prior to this, including two back-to-back blowout losses of 36 points and 27 points. They had fallen to almost .500, and were in real danger of missing the playoffs in the West.

This is when Kobe went full nuclear mode, scoring 4 straight 50-point games and 5 straight 40-point games. The Lakers won all 5 games, and they needed all of Kobe's points, as they won every game by single digits. 

Bonus: Kobe and Carmelo Anthony had been battling for the scoring title this season. The final game of the Lakers' 7-game losing streak was against Carmelo and the Nuggets, and Melo outscored Kobe in a 27 point blowout. This really lit a fire in Kobe, and over the rest of the season he took a definitive lead in what HAD been a neck-and-neck scoring title race. Kobe finished the season with 31.6 PPG, Melo with 28.9 PPG.

594	Kobe vs Lebron's top 3 playoff series(but done correctly this time)	"There was a post titled "" Kobe vs Lebron top 3 playoff series: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9bym0b/kobe\_vs\_lebron\_top\_3\_playoff\_series/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9bym0b/kobe_vs_lebron_top_3_playoff_series/))

This post took the ""best"" three playoff series of each player, and ""averaged"" them. The reason why there are quotation marks is that:

**No.1 :** They did not define what the ""best"" three playoff series for each player were. It was some combination of statistical dominance and defensive ranking of opponent.  For Kobe, they took two series against the **No.1** ranked defensive team in the league, and one series against the **No.19** ranked Phoenix Suns. For Lebron, it was two series against the **No.1** ranked defensive team, and one series against the **No.4**  ranked 2016 Warriors.

**No.2:** They didn't actually average the shooting numbers correctly to account for the number of games at all. They just took the overall FG%, FT%, and 3Point % and divided it by 3, as opposed to taking the total shot attempts/makes and then dividing by the number of games appropriately. Also they forgot to include TS%, which is the best measure of efficiency in terms of scoring.

I will fix this, and do what the post intended to do, but this time without misleading people. What I am doing, and I will state this, is take the ***3 most statistically impressive series for each player, list them, and then correctly average the numbers***

# Kobe's top 3 playoff series(in no order)

3. *2001 WCSF against Kings(4 games):* **35 ppg, 9 rebounds, 4 assists**, **on 59 % TS**

**Cumulative Averages: 34 ppg, 7 rebounds, 6.2 assists, on 62 % TS**

​

Average Defensive Ranking of opponent(via DRTG): **11.3**

# Lebron's top 3 playoff series(in no order)

2. *2017 ECSF against Raptors(4 games):* **36 ppg, 8.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, on 73 % TS**

Anyone else surprised at how he stepped it up in the Finals? Usually where the stars rise and the role players get a reduced role. I know he was basically the second option on both teams, but it's not like anyone thinks either of the 2006 or 2011 Mavericks were a big 2 with Dirk and Jet. Also he went against Wade in both Finals.

602	How do you think the Miami Heat(2014) would've fared with a PRIME Hassan Whiteside?	"Hassan signed with the Heat about two months into the 2014-2015 season. Less than 6 months after Lebron left the Heat and rejoined the Cavs. Even though Hassan Whiteside is a liability on the court these days, back during the 2014-16 seasons, dude was BEAST. I vivdly remember his debut game against the Bulls. He had a triple double with 12 blocks completely shutting them down. Dude was such an asset for us back than that his injury during the playoff series vs the Raptors (2016) was the swinging point in Raptors favors (Robbed us of a much awaited Wade vs Lebron playoff match up). 

But what always frustrated me as Heat fan looking back is that we discovered such a hidden gem in Hassan only after the fact Lebron had already left. During those 4 years, the Center position was our Achilles heel. Teams would kill us in reboubds and post ups. Hassan Whiteside was a force. And i believe, he would've been a HUGE help to us. Especially in 2014 against a Tim Duncan who would eat us alive on the post and Tony Parker getting in lanes. "	nba

606	No idea about the NBA, but want to learn	"Hey guys, I'm not really into sports. I'm from Germany, but I lost interest in football/soccer. After 27 years I just recently got around to play some basketball for the first time and looked at plays, players, etc. It's really fun and a sport I can genuinely watch for enjoyment. 
How should I go about learning everything about the NBA, drafting (no clue at all), different teams, rules. I'd like to cheer for a team, but have no idea what they're all about. 
In Germany and football you kind of know about the bigger teams and what they stand for, for example. Or at least you could pick the one closest to where you're from.

621	The Only Finals MVP to lose the Finals	"I've been reading a bit about how LeBron should've been the finals MVP in 2014-15 despite being on the losing team, and remembered that this actually happened once. In 1969, Jerry West won the inaugural Finals MVP award despite losing the series 3-4 to the last Celtics team featuring Bill Russell. Here are his per game lines.

Game 1: 53-3-10

Game 2: 41-3-8

Game 3: 24-1-6

Game 4: 40-6-4

Game 5: 39-3-9

Game 6: 26-4-3

Game 7: 42-13-12

Series Average of 38/4.7/7.5

West pulled a hamstring 3 minutes before the end of Game 5. He put up a 40 point triple double in Game 7 of the NBA Finals on a bum ankle. That is insane.

Here's the wikipedia account of the 7th game:

In anticipation of a Lakers win, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had ordered thousands of balloons with ""World Champion Lakers"" printed on them suspended from the rafters of the Forum. Flyers were placed in every seat stating, ""When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the rafters, the USC marching band will play ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.""\[1\] Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans.\[2\] When Jerry West went to the court for a pre game shoot around and saw the balloons, he became furious with Cooke. Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, ""Those fucking balloons are staying up there.""\[1\] With only two true guards on the Laker roster and West still feeling the effects of the hamstring pull, Celtics coach Russell ordered his players to fast break at every opportunity.

Los Angeles shot poorly in the early going, and the Celtics jumped out to a first-quarter 24–12 lead which was cut to 59–56 at halftime. Then, Celtics sixth man Don Nelson scored 12 points in the third quarter, while the Lakers hardly connected on a quarter of their field goal attempts: the Celtics led 91–76 after the third. Early in the fourth quarter, Chamberlain incurred his fifth foul (he had never fouled out of a game in his career) and had to play more tentative defense. Then, with just over 5 minutes remaining and the Lakers trailing 103-96, Chamberlain landed awkwardly when grabbing a rebound and came to the bench with an injured knee. Behind backup center Mel Counts, the Lakers cut the lead to 103–102 with two minutes left. Chamberlain then informed Van Breda Kolff that he was ready to return, but the coach infamously told the superstar center ""we're doing fine without you"", and Chamberlain never got back in the game. Boston still held the 103-102 lead with 1:33 left in the game when reserve guard Keith Erickson knocked the ball away from John Havlicek. The ball went right to Don Nelson, who put up a desperation 18 foot shot from the free throw line to beat the 24 second clock; the ball hit the back rim, bounced high in the air and fell through the hoop to give Boston a 105-102 lead. The Lakers committed costly turnovers in the last moments and trailed 108-104 before making a meaningless last second shot that made the final score 108–106.

I think it is pretty obvious from the Suns perspective; a solid big man that can play the 4 next to Ariza and Ayton. A cheap point guard that doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective, and most importantly...cap flexibility. 

The Pacers have Collison as their pg and just spent a *first round pick* on Aaron Holiday, a young pg with professional pedigree. **ALSO** Thad Young opted into his contract this offseason, he knew he wouldn't make as much on the open market! Even the Pacers wouldn't give him a big deal, they know Sabonis is the future, and even with growing pains sharing the floor with Turner, he's their guy.

640	"(Mar 2009) Shaq's rips ORL coach Stan Van Gundy for accusing him of 'flopping': ""Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching"""	"[One of Shaq's greatest rants](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3953133) which was in response [to this play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyk7IrlPjpQ)

 Full context:

&gt;The episode that inspired this latest Shaq rant came after O'Neal took an elbow to the chest from Dwight Howard during a third-quarter Magic possession during Orlando's 111-99 victory and crumbled to the floor looking to draw an offensive foul.

&gt;**""I was shocked, seriously shocked,"" Van Gundy said, ""and very disappointed because he knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.""**



&gt;O'Neal acknowledged he had flopped, but said it was the first time he had done it in his career. Over the years, O'Neal has been particularly critical of players (most notable Vlade Divac) who had flopped while trying to defend him.

&gt;**""Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching,"" O'Neal said, steering the conversation back to Van Gundy. ""I'm not going to just sit abound and let nobodies take shots at me, and he is a nobody to me. And if he thinks he can get in a little press conference and take shots at me like I'm not going to [give] something back, he's got another thing coming.""**


And Shaq didn't stop there either:

&gt;""I heard his comment. Flopping to me is doing it more than one time, and I realized when I tried to take the charge, as I went down, I realized that that play reminded me of his whole coaching career,"" O'Neal said of Van Gundy. ""And one thing I really despise is a front-runner, so I know for a fact that he's a master of panic, and when it gets time for his team to go in the postseason and do certain things, he will let them down because of his panic. I've been there before, I've played for him.""

652	Michael Jordan 33 points and 13 assists in game 2 of the 1991 Finals	"https://youtu.be/9sNxsE7hRuQ

This game is known more as the switch-hand layup game, where while going through the lane MJ leaps for a dunk with a right hand and ends up laying it up with his left due to the defense closing in. 

In a thread about the overrated moves of all-time, I saw this and decided to provide context on it. The switch hand layup capped off a *13 consecutive field goal streak.* He was shooting 15-18, the most efficient ever in a Finals game, and also provided 13 assists with his 33 point effort. Definitely one if the best games ever in MJ’s career."	nba
653	In game 1 of the 1996 ECF (Magic vs Bulls), Shaq and Penny Hardaway combined for 65 points. The rest of their starting lineup scored 2 points combined.	"The Magic were destroyed in Chicago losing 121-83 and ultimately being swept in the series. Even Shaq had a pretty terrible game for his standards, with alot of his points coming in garbage time. 



The entire team outside of Shaq and Penny combined for 16 points which is absolutely insane.. 2 points combined for 3 players in the starting lineup.. Gotta do better than that against the 72-10 Bulls but it was hard with a defensive big 3 of Pippen/Rodman/Jordan

Knight, rights to Edwards, a first round (+ maybe a second) for Jonathan Simmons and DJ Augustin

with augustin still gives us an extra guard that can play and shoot for insurance

simmons gets us that 3 that we still need

magic get a better point guard if healthy because all they have is jerian grant and dj, and some decent assets being a late first, a second round player, and maybe another second

and all 3 of knights, dj and simmons contract is all the same length and basically the same salary so they wont be taking back any extra money

they have a ton of wings and forwards so they probably wont miss simmons too much given the fact that hes 29 and they have any people they need to play"	nba

665	Thanos Snaps the NBA: The Houston Rockets	"Again, to clarify my methods. There is a 50% chance that a player will be snapped (killed) by Thanos. This time I used random.org to determine if a player survived.

First of all, sorry for the long delay in this post, I apologize. I've been pretty busy of late. I will be doing 2 teams today. 

Snapped: James Harden, Nene, Michael Carter-Williams, Gerald Green, Isaiah Hartenstein, Clint Capela, Gary Clark, Rob Gray, Alessandro Gentile, Bruno Caboclo, Vincent Edwards, Brandon Knight

Survivors: Marquese Chriss, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Zhou Qi, Chris Paul, James Ennis, Carmelo Anthony

James Harden is lying on the ground grasping his chest. Thanos hadn't snapped yet, but someone had lightly grazed him in practice. But then the snap comes, and the Beard turns to dust. Face it, this team is still pretty good, but losing an MVP is really going to hurt your chances. Not even Thanos' snap could get Melo off the bench. Brandon Knight hadn't even unpacked his bags when he was snapped. The team does keep three of the 5 starters, and keeping CP3 is a major plus. For some reason, Thanos continues to snap Centers, and the Rockets are stuck with Qi as the only big. Still, I think this team is a contender, but the Nuggets are the team to beat in the West.

670	Through NBA history up until 2010 only 3 players completed a postseason with 20 PPG on 65% TS. McHale ('88) Ginobili ('05) &amp; Billups ('09). In this decade Lebron ('14), KD ('17), Steph ('17) &amp; Kawhi ('17) have all accomplished the feat.	"[SOURCE](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_game&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=11&amp;c2stat=pts_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=20&amp;c3stat=ts_pct&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=65&amp;order_by=ws)

I couldn't believe McHale did it so long ago so I've added a table of League Wide TS% for each season mentioned. Surprisingly 2005 had the lowest average (bloody Pistons!).


Season|League AVE TS%                      
 :------          |   :--                                  
 87/88     | 53.8 % 
 04/05     | 52.9 % 
 08/09     | 54.4 % 
 13/14     | 54.1 % 
 16/17     | 55.2 % 

McHale's, Billups' and Kawhi's were the only performances not to earn at least a finals berth for their team. Also I love seeing Chauncey and Manu, two non-mvp's renowned for being clutch in big moments, up there alongside the biggest names for this stat.

Are players getting more awesome or is it more that the game and or officiating has changed in favor of offense?

Anyone who’s watched a Celtics game last season where Rozier has started in place of Irving knows that Rozier loves to handle the ball and score at will, which he may not be able to do enough of in Boston playing 12-15 minutes a game behind Irving. Give this man a chance to start in Phoenix!

Survivors: Victor Oladipo, Myles Turner, Ike Anigbogu, Edmond Sumner, Tyreke Evans, Kyle O'Quinn, Alize Johnson, CJ Wilcox


Today is a bad day to be a forward in Indiana. This reminds me of the Celtics, in that the team is still solid with most of the starters surviving. Oladipo, Evans, and Turner are three solid players. O'Quinn is iffy, but has shown solid play while on the Knicks. Losing Doug, Young, and Collison really hurt this team all around. If O'Quinn can be decent, this team has a chance to contend. I still think the Hornets are the frontrunners in the East.

694	Key point of the Deng buyout and stretch is eliminates potential for Lakers to sign two max guys next summer.	"As long as Deng was on the Lakers books, there was always the chance that his entire $18M could be moved elsewhere next summer, by attaching assets to it.  That would’ve given the Lakers a path to clear their entire books except for Lebron and minimums or cap holds, and then sign two max guys.  

Instead, by stretching Deng today, the Lakers have that $5M on the books in ‘19-20, no matter what.  That $5M cannot be moved.  

That means the Lakers can sign one max guy next summer - KD, Kawhi, or Butler - but definitely not two out of the three.  And no way in hell any of those guys sign for half their market value on a non-title winner given their injury histories.  

I think today’s move makes it very likely that next year’s Lakers team is the current core plus their 2019 draft pick (which I personally think will be in the lottery after Lebron plays 58-60 games and has a ‘recharge the batteries’ season that ends in March), plus Kawhi.  

Also notable:  today’s waive and stretch very likely means that next summer is the last time the Lakers will have cap space for the next 4+ years.  Their team going forward is the current core, Lebron, and one more max guy next summer.  

If it’s not KD, that’s not enough to beat the Warriors.  If it’s Kawhi or Butler, it is a good WCF candidate tho. "	nba

696	It's crazy to think that Lebron's Miami stint may have robbed us of some of the greatest individual playoff runs of all time	"Lebron first learnt to win chips in Miami, and common perception is that he peaked during that time.  It's interesting to think that if he didn't submit himself to the free flowing, highly successful Miami system, and instead had gone somewhere with less talent, we may have seen a couple more crazy statistical playoff runs

Even before Miami, Lebron was a generational scorer. In the playoffs, Lebron could rattle off 30-40 point performance like it was nothing. For god's sake, he averaged 35 ppg on 60 % TS in the 2009 playoffs. Even as a defender, he was one of the league's best, finishing near the top in DPOY voting and continuing it in the playoffs.

We all know Lebron got better as he got older, so imagine what type of ridiculous playoff run Lebron was capable of that we didn't end up seeing.

I could very well see him putting together a : 36 ppg, 8 rebounds, 8 assists on 57-58 % TS, while playing ATG defense, type of run"	nba
697	The only players not named Michael Jordan or Lebron James who have a Top 10 WS season of all time in the 3 point era are David Robinson and Kevin Durant	"The top 10 WS seasons of all time in the 3 point era are dominated by MJ and LeBron, but David Robinson in 1994 and Kevin Durant in 2013 and 2014 were able to rank 5th, 8th, and 10th, respectively.

701	[Discussion] Trick of the Month - September 2018 - Find It	"For the September Trick of the Month, we’ll be teaching our dogs Find It. In this trick, they’ll be using their noses to find a hidden treat or toy, or even to identify the scented object between multiple identical looking objects! This game is great for mental stimulation and stress relief and can also be a very constructive activity for dogs struggling with reactivity!

​

Here's how it works:

1: Teach a dog the trick. Don't own a dog? Borrow your neighbors or grandmas dog, they'll be thrilled when you teach them cool things.

2: Film the dog performing the trick.

3: Upload video/picture

4: Post link to video or pictures in the results thread that will appear at the end of the month.

702	[Fluff] A story from when I was a volunteer at the SPCA	"Back in high school I was a volunteer at my local SPCA, which meant I spent a few hours every weekend walking and playing with the dogs at the shelter. When I started there was one dog in particular that had already been there for about six months, she was a bigger dog and didn’t get along well with other dogs or most people. I tried to spend time with her every weekend, and became pretty attached to this dog. One weekend I came in and she was gone, someone had decided to adopt her and all the staff was ecstatic about it.

She was back in before the end of the month, the owner said they just couldn’t handle her attitude. It’s not unheard of, but it was really sad to see her come back in. Her attitude problems started to get worse after coming back in, and several more months passed. Then one day we had a man come in to look at adopting, and this dog goes NUTS. Turns out this guy had been deployed a year prior, and had to hand her over to the SPCA because he didn’t have anyone who could watch her for a year. There were a lot of tears, he left with her very shortly after and we never saw her again"	dogs
703	[Discussion] Apartment dogs vs house dogs	"Stop telling people in apartments that they can't get a big/high energy dog. In my experience I've noticed apartment dogs with no backyard space get way more exercise than dogs who have a backyard. I've found that backyard dogs are just let out there and get a few 15 minute walks a day while apartment dogs are taken out for runs and get to go to the dog park since the owners don't think their home is big enough for them. 

Dogs mostly just sleep at home or chew on their toys anyways if they get enough exercise and stimulation. If you want to get a dog who needs a lot of exercise but you live in an apartment, don't let this discourage you. If you're actively working your dog and giving him/her the proper time and attention they need then you'll be fine. "	dogs
704	[fluff] Brought our rescue doggo to help tend our farmers' market stall and she did AWESOME! So proud.	"Living rurally, we don't see many people or dogs, crowds, or busy places. I really wasn't sure how she'd do, so I expected to tie her to the car. The farmers' market is like the local dog park, where dogs come by on leashes or vendor's wandering dogs come visiting for snacks.

Stella ROCKED IT. We didn't need to be tied up at all. She stuck by my side, laid under the table, took treats nicely, and followed me around to shop. Most surprisingly, if she got up to go visit a dog uninvited, she had perfect recall. She took pets from all the visitors nicely and charmed everyone. THIS great attitude and trustworthiness were what I really wanted in a farm dog, and I definitely don't take all the credit for her abilities.

Just for fun, [here's a pic..](https://imgur.com/a/0jSA4Cv)

Stuffed with treats, panting, and exhausted from stimulus, she had a long nap that afternoon."	dogs
705	[Help] Got bit by a dog today.. and I’m in shock.	"Idk if this is the right place to post this.. but I got bit by a dog while I was working today. I’m a social services worker, and I went to visit one of my client’s families. I knocked on the door and a dog ran between the owners legs. It jumped on me like it was being friendly, but then it jumped down and bit my upper thigh and lower leg. It jumped back up and scratched/bruised my wrist pretty bad.

I’m in complete shock. It could have been a lot worse, but I’m still banged up pretty good. How do I cope with this?

707	[Help] Should I be trying to correct my dog for retaliating?	"Hi,

I've got a 9 month old Australian Shepherd. She's well trained, well socialized and gets plenty of exercise. 

We go to the dog park 5-6 times per week and she does great. She plays and runs and chases balls and visits people. Super friendly to all dogs and people, and if you had asked me at 6 months I'd have told you she didn't have an aggressive bone in her body. 

In the last few months, she's had a few incidents. She never initiates the fight, but when she's challenged she goes from 0 to ballistic in an instant. As soon as another dog makes an aggressive action she loses her mind and she does not back down. I don't think she's actually trying to hurt the other dog (she's not going for the throat, she snarls and snaps), but it's still unacceptable at the park.

It's happened once when another dog tried to hump her, once when a dog got protective over his ball, and 3 or 4 times when another dog is being possessive of their owner. She'll go up to another dog parent, they'll start petting her, their dog will snap at her and she'll go crazy. 

When I pull her off, she stops. When I let her go again, she doesn't go back after the other dog. 

I've been pulling her off and shouting NO. It happened twice today and we went home. I almost made this post a month ago, but she's had 3-4 good weeks and until today I thought she'd stopped. 

It occurred to me that I might be trying to battle hard wired instinct here, and trying to correct her for (in her mind) the proper response to aggression might be confusing. 

I don't want her to be afraid to defend herself, but I'd also like to go to the dog park without every little incident turning into an all out brawl. Is there a method for this kind of behavior? Is this normal dog behavior, or is it indicative of some other issue?

Thanks for your insight"	dogs
708	[Vent] If you have a bad feeling about another dog, trust your gut. Even if you feel rude.	"I was walking my dog earlier when I saw someone coming up the road with a bully type dog. He looked friendly, almost overtly so, straining and whining and all wiggles and goofiness, but I got a weird feeling especially as she didn't look physically capable of controlling him and felt like I needed to cross the street. I stopped and started to cross, and the dog's owner called out ""It's okay! He's friendly!"" I called back ""Mine isn't,"" even though he is, just to be safe, and she started following us and calling ""Let them sniff! It's okay, your dog looks sweet!"" Of course my corgi was bouncing and happy-barking, making me look like a liar, so against my better judgment I stopped trying to cross because it was so awkward trying to get away from this lady. I didn't want her to think I was prejudiced either, I'm not, it was that specific dog I had a weird gut feeling over.

She walked up to us and all of a sudden completely lost control of her dog. He barreled at mine, grabbed him by the harness and starting shaking him. I'm yelling, my dog is crying, chaos everywhere. He would not let go of my dog no matter how much I punched and kicked him. Fortunately he had my dog by the handle of his harness, and when the harness popped off, my dog got free and ran (almost getting hit by a car). She was able to hold her dog back while I caught mine, we exchanged information, I took him straight to the vet and he's going to be fine. Just has some abrasions and bruising from the harness.

I feel like the biggest idiot. I had such a bad feeling about meeting the other dog and must have somehow gotten a subconscious cue from his body language. Please, if your gut is telling you another dog is bad news for yours, listen to it even if the dog SEEMS friendly. Because I almost lost my dog today. Your instincts very well might be right."	dogs
709	[Help] doubting my decision,should i put my dog down before it gets worse?	"\*This is my first post on Reddit i don't know how everything works yet.

\*Also English is not my first language so i apologize for spelling/grammar mistakes in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I made an appointment to put my dog Noor ( 12 years old female Rhodesian Ridgeback ) to sleep on Friday. She has arthritis which seems to get worse. And since a month ago she can't hold her pee anymore. She pees everywhere. When she's asleep, when she walks her bladder control is gone. When she lays down and sometimes after half an hour gets up her legs will get all wet from laying in her own pee. So we use diapers now. Also we had to throw  out her arthritis bed because she wouldn't lay on it anymore because it smelled like urine.

Then last week it started getting worse she threw up everyday, didn't eat as much as she used too. The vet did a blood test and said she has Kidney failure quite advanced, there is nothing more they can do except putting her on special dog food ( if she wants to eat it) and giving her medicine to control her nauseousness. Also she lost a lot of weight 4 kl (8 pounds ) and she can barely walk anymore because she loses balance or falls over. Also getting up hurts sometimes she can't even get up and when we tried to help her up she bit my mom out of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that her arthritis pain killers aren't working anymore so they have to be increased but the pain killers are bad for her kidney's. It feels like a vicious circle. We decided to put her too sleep.But i contemplate it every day, almost every minute. When she wags her tail, or has more appetite i immediately  think i made the wrong decision. Because the thing is she is happy but sometimes in pain. Also the vet won't give me a clear answer when to do it.

I wonder should you put a dog to sleep preventative or should you wait when the dog is on the edge of pain. I feel like i can't see it clearly anymore. My mom says it's better to put her to sleep. But she's been with us since i was 6 years old i almost don't know what life is like without her.

&amp;#x200B;

So could someone please give me advice? i would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl/dr dog has severe arhtritis, incontinence and kidney failure but is sometimes happy. cant make a decision if i should put her down or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: hi, thank you all for the quick reply. I only replied specifically to one person because I didn’t realized i already got multiple responses. ( i don’t understand how Reddit works quite yet) 

Like i said in the reply, it feels easier making the decision now. And deep inside i know it’s time, and that i should not wait until it’s to late. I don’t want to put her trough that. She deserves better. 
It feel less guilty putting her to sleep hearing your responses and knowing i’m doing the right thing. 

So thank you"	dogs
710	"[Discussion] Our failed attempts to ""fix"" our separation anxiety dog, and issues with the rescue covering up behavior problems"	"**tldr; adopted a dog we did not know had separation anxiety, tried to help him for 2 months, couldn't handle it, and now he's been ""fixed"" by the rescue in a week.**


Right now I’m feeling a cocktail of emotions—anger, disappointment, failure, guilt, sadness, and probably some other things. I hope you will be kind to me, as I truly think we did everything we could handle to help this dog. Of course we could have done more to keep this dog, but our anxiety was just too much. I think we will be fostering in the near future (with another organization) to help prevent another situation like ours. My post history details many of the things we tried. I'm not looking to be told I am right, but please try to be kind, I would really appreciate that, since I am already so upset about this whole situation.


We adopted a 6/7 month old pit mix from a reputable, and popular local foster-based rescue on May 31. He has a lovely personality—is especially friendly toward humans and beyond gentle with children. He is smart, eager to please, and a breeze to obedience train! During the meet and greet, we asked a ton of questions about how he would do as the only dog in the household, how much exercise he needed, and all of the questions we thought we were supposed to ask. We were told by the foster (who had a 13 year old Husky) that he barked for 20 minutes in his crate, and then calmed down and was “fine,” for up to 4 hours. That sounded appropriate for our situation—one of us works from home 75% of the time and the other is PhD student with a flexible schedule. We planned to use a dog walker on the days we would have to be gone longer, and daycare/boarding for when we had to leave town. He seemed like a great fit and we were excited when we were approved to take him home.


The first week went well. My boyfriend worked from home and stayed with the dog all day long, and at night, we spent time playing with and walking our new puppy. We watched YouTube videos to learn to crate train him—he was starting to get it, and would walk into the crate on command most of the time. My boyfriend left the house to get lunch a couple of times that week, watching the dog on video when he left. He was gone for 45 minutes one day. The dog barked for about 20 minutes, settled down for 5, then started barking again. He managed to bite open the latch on his crate when left upstairs (we were in the house), and he cleared a baby gate multiple times. We didn’t yet realize this was a problem.


June 6 we left for 3.5 hours to run an errand, leaving the dog at home. When we returned, there was a note on our door from our apartment neighbor telling us that the dog had been barking the entire time we were gone. We were horrified and embarrassed, so we consulted a friend who is a vet, purchased Malena DiMartini’s book, “Treating Separation Anxiety in Dogs, and hired a trainer who was recommended to us by our vet. We also contacted the rescue and asked for some advice.


The rescue director explained to us how to crate train (exactly what we had been doing), and told us to use a “high quality e-collar to prevent “barking in the crate.” She also sent me this video and posts from random blogs. We strongly disagreed with punishment methods for anxiety, based on the copious amounts of research we had done, and got quite upset with her. I still cannot believe someone who has worked with rescue dogs believes that bark collars are a fix for anxiety.


The trainer recommended a plan similar to Malena DiMartini’s desensitization protocol, not using the crate. If you’re not familiar with it, it involves slowly building up the time you leave your dog alone, never letting them go over their anxiety threshold. We also started him on a low dose of Prozac at the suggestion of two vets and the trainer. The reason for no crate was that many dogs with separation anxiety also have confinement  anxiety. Instead, we blocked off a 200 square foot section of our living room, which included water, toys, a window, the couch, treats, and his crate. In her book, Malena stresses that this process can take several months, and regressions are part of the process. The tricky part is you can never leave your dog alone. That means, you need to find someone to watch the dog when you go to work. That was fine with us—we would take him to daycare on the few days my boyfriend had to go into his office or when we needed to run errands. We did not even mind that it costs over $40 per day in Seattle, it meant we could have some freedom and flexibility in our schedule. We set up a temperament test at the daycare and of course he failed—jumped over the playpen fence and barked wildly at the other dogs. I cried the whole way home. We tried again 3 weeks later—he failed for the same reason. Determined to make it work, I started using Rover sitters in our neighborhood and posted on Facebook asking for paid help from friends. People were willing to help, but it took me a lot of time to set up care for him, and this solution was not nearly as flexible as daycare. We also had him going to a weekly group training and socialization class for older puppies. He learned quickly, but was NOT great at playtime. He got quickly stimulated, and could not handle playtime with more than one other dog. While he was not reactive, he would bark at the other dogs, and a few times he began to growl. The trainer called him “socially inept,” but did help us understand his body language and gave us tips for socialization. When he met dogs on the leash, he was usually pretty scared, but never aggressive. In the meantime, we bought a new car (we were carless in a big city with decent public transportation that allows dogs). This was not something that was done solely for the dog, but we thought it would be a partial solution to not being able to leave the house. One of us could sit inside or outside of the car with the dog when we went somewhere and we could finally take our boy on hikes. Well, that didn’t work. After having previously ridden in cars, he developed car sickness, and would vomit within 10 minutes of starting the trip. Great. The vet gave us a prescription for Cerenia ($10 a pill), and did that work? Nope. Another thing we had to work on, and the summer hikes and camping trips we had looked forward to were cancelled. Still, we thought we could manage it. 


When we started desensitization, our dog was at the point where he would get anxious before we even left. We started with touching the door knob, and then started absences. In about 3 weeks, he got to 7 minutes (in evening and 30 seconds in the morning) and we were hopeful! At that point, a contractor came to our house, and we had to contain the dog in a crate. He was extremely anxious, but the crate clamed him right down. We were shocked by this, and figured the crate might help during desensitization. Surprisingly, it did! He stayed alone for 30 minutes without anxiety! We bought the dog a bigger crate, and restarted crate training. I tested him multiple times without the crate, and he would pace around the house, whine, and scratch at the door within minutes. With the crate, he settled quickly. While the crate worked for desensitization training, he would not get into it willingly. He did go in sometimes, especially when he was hungry, but he was clearly afraid of the crate. It was the only way we could leave him, so we continued using it.


Desensitization training took a toll on us. Both of us humans are prone to anxiety (especially me), and it was very hard to give our lives up to the dog. We were noticing physical symptoms of stress (vomiting, hair loss, etc.) and we were arguing more than usual. Social events were cancelled, we spent MANY MANY hours on training every evening after work, and I worried about him constantly. I even worried about what would happened when we moved in a couple of years. Even if we “fixed” him now, once we changed his environment, he would regress. Separation anxiety is a life-long condition that requires management throughout the dog’s lifespan. Training, however, was working, and there was progress, albeit slow progress. He was always watched on camera when we left, so we knew exactly how he was doing when we left. We got him up to just about 2 hours with no anxiety. Of course, progress was inconsistent. Some days were better than others. I had to run home from dinner or the park down the street on several occasions because the dog started to panic. Panic manifested in panting and whines, no more barking.


Around the middle of August, our dog regressed a bit, and was starting to panic after 40 minutes. We dialed down training, and he was doing fine with 30 minute departures, and eventually he could handle 90 minutes once again. The straw that broke the camel’s back was what happened after we “borrowed” a friend’s dog when they went out of town for 4 nights. Our dog loved this 5 years old gentle giant, and although he still didn’t seem happy when we left, he did a lot better being left with the other dog, compared to being alone. We started to think that maybe this dog needed a companion. Unfortunately, another dog was something we could not handle for a multitude of reasons, which I do not feel I need to justify. We were upfront with the rescue that our household would be a single dog household. I was hopeful that the “borrowed” dog’s leaving would not have an impact on our dog, but it did. The day after the other dog left, our dog had a complete meltdown in the crate within 15 minutes. I absolutely had to leave the house for 90 minutes for a work meeting, so I left the dog. He started barking, clawing at the crate, and whining, but I was too far from home to turn around and save him. We tried for a few more days to leave him for any period of time, but it was clear that he had developed an aversion to the crate. He actually got the crate open when my boyfriend was in the other room and jumped on top of the crate to get over a playpen. I tried again without the crate, and he scratched up the door after less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. He had regressed nearly to the point at which he was when we started, and we would probably have to repeat the process without the crate.


Yes, we could have hung in there and done this over again. This was a regression—something that is normal in separation anxiety training. But you know what? My boyfriend and I couldn’t handle it. We were just done. We were 9 weeks into this, and couldn't go back to week 1.


On August 26, we returned the dog to the rescue director. We explained the situation and everything that we had tried.While she agreed to take the dog back, which I appreciate, but  was very cruel to us over email. She made fun of us for using methods that ""didn't work,"" and mocked us. (Please let me know if you'd like to see the emails, I can screenshot them.) She told us that they would be using the bark collar to make sure he was “calm” in his crate.


Today, September 4 (just over a week later), I checked the rescue’s website and our former dog is listed up for adoption with the description below. There is no mention of his separation anxiety. The description says he is crate trained, something we struggled with for weeks. The description says he plays appropriately with other dogs off-leash. It’s almost as if this description was written to spite us and tell us that everything we noticed about this dog and struggled with is not true. I’m thinking that maybe we are the problem, but honestly, I think the rescue is just lying to get this dog adopted quickly.


*Fezzy is an adorable 9-month-old male mixed breed. His shelter and vet paperwork say ""Lab Mix"" but his DNA test lists him as 37.5% staffy and an assortment of many other breeds including Chihuahua!! He's a true mutt, the BEST breed! This boy is very loving and affectionate, and would like to be adopted to a home with another doggy pal to keep him company. Fezzy is crate trained, house-trained (as long as he gets out to potty every 4 hours) and knows sit, down, come and is working on place. He walks like an absolute dream on a leash and is a great companion to dog-friendly places. He is not reactive to other dogs on leash and is a happy go lucky companion. He plays appropriately with other dogs off-leash.*


I saw this when I woke up and I felt ill. I can’t help but feel so sorry for the next family who will be adopting him without knowledge of his behavior issues. Maybe another dog will help him, but he still has a serious behavioral issue. Most importantly, I feel terrible for our former dog whose issues will not be taken seriously, and for this reason is at risk of being returned over and over."	dogs

717	[Help] My dog suddenly won't poop outside	I recently moved from a house to an apartment. For the first few days, I primarily kept her kenneled except for feeding, play, and walks. I would let her out, take her down to eliminate, then play for a while and relax, then kennel her again before she needed to go. After that first few days, I didn't keep her kenneled and I didn't have any problems. That lasted for 2 weeks. Yesterday she didn't poop when she usually does, and instead, pooped in the bedroom about an hour later. Our typical night time routine is that I'll put my kids to bed, then come out and feed her, then take her down to do her business. Today I came out to feed her and discovered she'd pooped all over the living room. Not just a pile in a corner. In 5 separate piles in various places. I take her outside a minimum of 4 times a day so I'm not making her hold it extended periods of time. I don't want her to spend all her time in her kennel, but I don't want to destroy the carpet either! Help! 	dogs

She eats in the laundry and she knows he only food for he lounge is treats. I thought why not try again. Pointed at it and said ‘there it is’ and waited for her to pick it up then told her ‘go eat your dinner’ which means go to the laundry **and she took it in the laundry!**


Twice I did it standing by her and pointing at it with my toe and the last I had already sat in the lounge and just pointed in its general direction and said mothers it is, it’s there’ and she picked it up so I told her ‘go eat your dinner’ and she went to the laundry again! I’m reinforcing her stay and telling her to stay there when she’s in there but I’m so happy this one just clicked tonight ❤️"	dogs
720	[Help] Found out 7 month old puppy may need $2000-$4000 surgery	Our Newfoundland puppy was limping so we took him to the vet. She said he may have a chip on his ball and socket joint.

721	[Help] Too much training?	"Is there such a thing as too much training? I have a Jack Russell puppy &amp; I am fully aware of the mistakes that can be made with Jacks, experienced owner! 

I’ve never raised one from puppyhood though. All of mine have been adults. So we’re starting his training class in 2 weeks, in the mean time I’ve been practicing the basics like sit etc.

I wondered if, there was such a thing as too much training? As well as his training class we have signed up for in 2 weeks, we’ve also put our name on the list for another class in October &amp; want to do the 3 good citizen awards too. 

Is it too much, does anybody see any possible negative outcome? 

He is already a good pup, he loves going to the vet and getting cuddles &amp; treats off everyone. He loves everyone, dogs, people, a statue he met lol. 

Really need to get this right, any advice appreciated thanks."	dogs
722	[Vent] just because my dog is cute doesn’t mean you’re entitled to touch him	I have a corgi and due to some very bad past experiences he does NOT like children. Ive been working with a trainer to fix this but until then he’s very skittish around them and I go out of my way to avoid them. I live in an apartment complex that’s mainly full of young people like me so luckily there’s not many children running around but when we go to the park (I have a route that avoids the playground there) there’s always at least one or two parents that try to insist that their kid meets my dog since he’s not exactly the most threatening lil guy. I always keep my distance and say “no he doesn’t like children don’t bring them over” but a week ago there was a woman who (my back was turned) walked up w her kid and when I felt my dog tugging away (not towards the kid- he is terrified of them but will bark and has twice snapped a little because he’s defending himself) I turned around and told her he doesn’t like kids and to leave us alone. She gave me the stink eye and walked away with him. A few moments later we were at the crosswalk and (obviously I’m facing the street) I hear my dog start growling and there’s the same kid w his mom and the kid grabs my dog’s leg prompting him to run into the street while barking. I end up cursing the lady out (I semi regret it but wtf if someone says their dog doesn’t like kids why are you letting your kid near my fucking dog???) she screams that I’m a bad person and that her kid just wanted to pet my dog. I seriously hate people that think that just because a dog looks a certain way that it doesn’t have boundaries/rules. We now only go on hiking trails but it’s like hey- if I say my dog doesn’t want to be near you back the fuck up. I’ve also had the same kind of problem with people just running up and not asking to pet him and then immediately touching him (he adores attention from adults most of the time unless hes swarmed by people- then he panics and tries to bolt and I mean come on just ask first) and it’s so frustrating. Should I just get a vest saying do not pet? I don’t want him missing out on the extra social interactions but I also don’t want him getting stressed out in public settings because of disrespectful people. 	dogs

724	[discussion] I think my dog is just genetically predisposed to anxiety and I'm so tired of people thinking she's been abused	"My puppy is about 6.5 months old and is still scared of a lot of things. Random things. She is scared of some loud noises but not all. She actually isn't scared of thunderstorms if you can believe it. Lol. It also depends on the day. Sometimes she's a big scaredy and other days she is more bold. She is scared of things on wheels, especially rolling trash cans. Sometimes she's scared of carts at pet stores but not always. She mainly hates these things indoors. As in, she is less scared of noises/rolling things on a walk outside than if we are in a pet store between shelving. She is also sometimes scared of certain men (1/5 usually). I have no idea why. But will run up happily to all children and women. She has gone EVERYWHERE with me since I got her at 7 weeks. She goes out to eat with me and we go to pet stores. We do long walks in urban areas. She has had more ""socialization"" than any dog I've ever owned. I don't know why she's scared of so many things. I've tried every method to get her less scared. She has gotten better over time for sure but she still struggles. I'm so tired of explaining to people that she's just shy. That I don't hit her and she's very loved. She wasn't abused by someone previously. She lives a happy life outside of being scared of bags flying across the lawn. Is a genetic predisposition really that uncommon? Cause I've met a lot of dogs that were raised in the same environment and one was bold and one was shy."	dogs

727	[Help] How do I have “outside dogs” inside the house while keeping the house clean?! Any tips?!	"My two dogs keep bringing so much dirt inside the house. We live on a ranch and for the most part, our dogs roam around free. They have dug several holes around the house and they actually like to go under the house and “hang out”. By that I mean, keep cool from the sun, look for small critters, hide bones...

In the morning, I drive my Polaris around while they stay near me for some doggie exercise. Leave the house around 8am to go do work at the ranch office while the dogs stay outside, come home around 11-1pm to make lunch for the cowboys, feed the dogs, do laundry..etc... and do some more doggie runs.  The dogs come inside during this time and I leave them outside while I finish up work back at the ranch office during the afternoons. 

I let the dogs back inside and by this time, they’ve tracked so much dirt inside! I love my doggies and love to keep them inside with me when I am home. 

My question is... does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to keep the dogs from playing in the dirt around my house? If I re-sod the perimeter of the house, will they just dig up the sod and create another dirt yard?! What are your thoughts on an electric fence? Are there any miracle rugs out there (lol)? Any and all suggestions are welcome!

728	[HELP] I’m worried about my 9m/o Golden Retriever — is it normal to be this itchy?	"I’ve had other dogs who liked having their ears scratched—especially when they were older—but this giant golden retriever puppy is kinda driving me nuts. Outside of play or sleep, she ALWAYS wants her ears scratched or her belly rubbed. Sometimes for an hour or more. If you don’t scratch her ears, she will cry. Constantly.

She has a lot of loose skin that I’m assuming she’ll grow into, so maybe that’s bothering her? I’ve never had a “big dog” before (and TBH I didn’t realize Goldens were big—I originally expected 40-50 pounds based on prior experience w/ a Golden/Irish Setter mutt (who was also the malnourished runt of the litter) so maybe this is normal... but I dunno. She seems very frustrated with all the itching and, frankly, I can’t always afford to spend hours at a time rubbing her belly while she gnaws on my wrist.

(Dunno if this is relevant, but I have health problems and am well aware that certain medications can cause really powerful itchy sensations that don’t go away, but my Golden puppy isn’t on any pills, though she was neutered a couple weeks ago and there is still some noticeable swelling where the stitches are, which may account for the belly itching. She’s got big floppy ears that are, as far as I can tell, clean—does not appear to be too much wax, dirt, or any signs of infection.)"	dogs

732	[Help] My dog and my partner's dog do not get on	"Hi guys,

I have a golden retriever bitch, Penelope, who turned one in June. I live on a farm and there are three labs (bitches as well) who live here too, so Penelope has always been around other dogs and had never shown any signs of aggression before. 

My partner has three dogs, one of which is a staffy x bitch ('Shadow'). I have been bringing Penelope around there ever since she was about six months old. Shadow is lovely, but she gets a bit funny around new dogs who come to her house - fair enough. At the start, she would growl at Penelope when we would arrive, but Penelope would do nothing - she wouldn't submit, she would just ignore her.

After a few months of that, Penelope has become the aggressive one. When Penelope sees Shadow she gets really agitated and tries to pick fights. I think it's because she's still on the defence from when she was younger and Shadow would growl at her. When they start carrying on we are usually able to stop it before it gets really bad, but they have had two proper fights now that we have had to separate. One of those fights was when we met at a neutral area (a park neither of the dogs had been before) and as soon as Penelope saw Shadow she ran up to her and they had a fight. Luckily, neither of these fights has resulted in serious injury for either dog, but I'm really worried it will eventually.

As it stands, it's a big problem because we aren't able to leave them alone together which is making the prospect of moving in together (which we had hoped to do in a few months) seem impossible.

I would really appreciate some advice on this!

Thanks in advance!

734	[HELP] Prescription dog food/mixing foods	"Hi all,

I have a 4.5 year old chocolate lab. Located central Canada.

Originally the breeder recommended and only gave us 2 year hip and eye guarantee with the dogs if we used this food:

https://www.tlcpetfood.com/dogfood/

Ever since he was just over 2 years old he started getting urine infections. After taking him to the vet, we were given prescription dog food (see link below)
 
https://www.hillspet.ca/en-ca/dog-food/pd-cd-multicare-canine-dry

This food works. He is healthy and he hasn't had a urine infection since.

At this point this food is just too expensive (~$130CDN/month). Is there any options to mixing the food with a less expensive brand or should I not try this? All the vet did was give me this food to fix the problem and charge me an arm and a leg. Is there any other good brands that wouldn't hurt the wallet that I could try?

Thanks

738	[Discussion] Shoulder height VS Head height	"Hello fellow dog lovers;

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Is there a standard metric for adding height to a dog above the shoulder?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A breed could be 28"" at the shoulder but head up could be above 33"", plenty high to put it's head on your dining room table. I want to know if there's any guage out there to determine it? My favorite dog in the world (RIP) Bently was a way oversized German Shorthaired Pointer who was 29"" at the shoulder and was above my hip with his head.

739	[QUESTION] [HELP] Our 85lb mutt is a huge scaredy-cat. Any advice on dealing with canine anxiety?	" 

Can anyone offer us advice on dealing with doggie anxiety? We have two-and-a-half year old shepherd/lab mix who is terrified of crowds and adolescents.

&amp;#x200B;

We raised Wiggie from a pup and always knew he had some anxiety (nervous in crowds and new situations, etc.) but never realized how bad it was until I went back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

We initially tried to put him in doggie daycare, but after a couple of days he was asked to leave because of separation anxiety. He would cry the entire time he was there and bang on the gate until I came to get him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a high school teacher and got permission from my principal to bring him to school with me, which I started doing about a year ago. Wiggie has a crate in my classroom and I usually leave the door open so he can come and go as he pleases. The first part of the year went well. The students loved him and he liked to wander out of his crate during class time and visit the students and be petted. We go out on the football field every day to play fetch and chase birds and usually go for a walk around the neighborhood.

&amp;#x200B;

The anxiety has gradually gotten worse. He now refuses to come out of the crate if anyone besides me is in the room. If anyone approaches the crate, he trembles and has growled a couple of times. When we get to school first thing in the morning, he makes a beeline for the classroom and his crate, tail tucked down. And a new thing: he's tried hiding under the bed in the mornings when it's time to leave for school and whines before we enter the building.

&amp;#x200B;

One note: twice last year a student hit him. Wiggie was sniffing around his bag and the student smacked him--didn't hurt him, but surprised him (and trust me, the kid got reamed out for that). I'm not sure if that's where his mistrust of students stems from.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to try getting him a Thundershirt and see if that makes him feel more secure and possibly CBD. Has anyone tried that with their pets for anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. I don't want to be torturing my dog every day."	dogs
740	[HELP] 4 1/2 year old boxer developing signs of aggression [Help]	" 

Hello fellow dog lovers! I have a 4 1/2 year old boxer named Bender, he's a great dog who for most of his life has been a very gentle and passive soul. On rare occasions he would get into a fight of any kind it would normally be with a dog that initially showed strong aggression or with certain Huskies (not sure why, he just isn't a fan I guess).

Since moving back into the city I at first left him at home during the day with the occasional dog walker, he remained happy and well behaved, frequently going to the nearby dog beach 2x a week minimum with no incident. Around 3 months ago I started to bring him to a local doggie daycare that would watch him while I was at work, and they never reported any incidents to me.

3 weeks ago, I took him to the dog beach where he attacked 2 dogs almost back to back, one was a huskie so I wasn't shocked, but was very upset, the other a slightly larger dog that he tried to violently hump (he is neutered). When I asked the day care if there had been incidents with him, they told me he has gotten progressively more aggressive, getting into regular fights with other dogs sometimes Once a day. This is all news to me this week.

He definitely has seperation anxiety, but that's gotten a lot better over the past year, however I need to know what I can do to curb this behavior, ALL of these fights start with him getting nose to nose with another dog, standing still for about 5-10 seconds, then lunging at them. He never draws blood (thank god) but does try to hump. He may not be the most well trained, but he can walk off leash and responds to verbal cues from me based on my tone of voice. Any help would be appreciated.

TL/DR 4 1/2 year old boxer started showing signs of aggression after starting dog daycare 3 months ago and now can't be trusted at dog parks, picks fights normally after staring at the dog, nose to nose, for a good 5-10 seconds, then lunges, but never draws blood."	dogs
741	[Help] Dog Keeps Hurting Same Leg/Hip	"My girlfriend and I adopted George in March, at about 3 months old.  He was surrendered by someone so we aren't sure exactly what he is, but we are pretty sure he's some combination of OES and poodle (I guess sheepadoodle is the common name?).  He's about 65 lbs right now and still growing but it seems most of the growing is behind him.  One thing that is starting to concern me is he has hurt his back right leg/hip three times now:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Jumping off of our bed, at around 5 months old, he landed funny and was whimpering and wouldn't put weight on the leg.  I had to carry him in and out to go to the bathroom that night.  By the next day he was walking with a limp, but we erred on the side of caution and took him to the vet.  They said not to sweat it and gave us Novox (carprofen).  We kept him from anything crazy the next few days and gave him the medicine and he ended up fine.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Running in our yard at around 7 months old, he jumped up onto our porch and hurt the same leg.  Again whimpering and wouldn't walk, but this time it only took a few hours for him to start feeling better and he was acting fine by the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Just last week (about 9 months old) while running at an off-leash dog park he slipped on some wet ground and wouldn't walk for a minute or so.  He kept playing after and only when we got home and the adrenaline had worn off did he really start acting like he was in pain.  This time it was about a day and a half of being unable (unwilling) to put any weight on it and carrying him outside to go to the bathroom and such.  He didn't really even want to squat to poop.  Vet told us over the phone to give Novox again and we kept him from doing anything very active for about a week (he was wanting to run again by day 3).  He seems totally fine now.

&amp;#x200B;

I should note that he can be dramatic, but I've heard dogs are generally bred to be stoic and if they act like they can't walk it's because they are really in pain.  My concern is that he will keep injuring himself and have joint problems or something down the road.  I guess this may seem overbearing, but I wanted to make sure this wasn't a sign of greater problems to come.  If I had hurt the same shoulder three times in a 4-5 month period I would be changing my behavior and considering going to a doctor, but not sure if that logic applies with a dog (hard to have a puppy not run around).  Any insight or similar experience is helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Dog keeps hurting his back right hip/leg (essentially a sprain) and I am curious as to whether that is a sign of problems to come or that we need to limit how he is playing"	dogs
742	[Help] dog stumbled and couldn’t walk well after playing fetch	"Hi all,

On the walk home he dropped the ball accidentally and fell over when he went to pick it up. He then kept walking kind of lopsided but wasn’t favoring a paw or anything.

745	[Discussion] Am I insane for considering getting a puppy and training my own quasi-service dog when I've never owned a dog before?	"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog. I am raising two humans who in their teens/tweens seem well-adjusted and don't chew on the shoes. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)

I would rather adopt because I'm not sure how to ethically participate in the dog economy. However, most rescues in my area are surrendered because of behaviour problems. In two months of searching I have yet to see a puppy up for adoption (I live in a small city surrounded by smaller cities).

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Biddable, good with kids and cats, not prone to barking, medium to large size, not super high energy. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Labrador, golden retriever, standard poodle, German shepherd, crosses/mixes of these breeds. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

From most to least import: Learn the names of my family members and get them for me when I need help (bonus points for waking the children in the morning on command), wear a harness that carries two ten-pound oxygen tanks and walk beside me, wear a harness with a handle to steady me on the stairs, retrieve household items, alert me when I'm breathing hard/my oxygen is low, open doors. I'm not looking to take the dog with me to malls and restaurants, just at home and on in-the-car errands. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm home all day, so I can do several hours of interaction as long as I can sit down for it. I can do about half an hour of daily training on my feet. I'm willing to enroll the dog in puppy obedience classes and possibly get some help from a trainer after that, but funds for the dog aren't unlimited. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

My husband and children would be responsible for walking the dog for 30-60 minutes a day. We do have a dog park nearby and could get there once or twice a week, weather permitting. We also have a decent sized back yard and I could certainly throw a ball. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Brushing every other day or so would be fine, as well as other small grooming tasks as needed. I would rather not have a dog that requires a haircut every few weeks. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Lots of shedding, a little barking, and a little slobber. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

A little. Most places we go have fences, even if they enclose several acres. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Somewhere in between. The dog certainly isn't going to sleep in my bed. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please.

July and August tend to be 30-35C with the humidex. The winters can be -30C at night with the wind chill for a couple of weeks. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

My mobility is good, but my stamina is low. It's possible my medical needs will increase in the next few years and I will be away from home more often. We do have family in the area who are probably willing to help.

746	[Help] Dog will not go in the yard	"Some backstory:

My oldest dog (Shepherd-Husky mix) is 5 years old and we have had her for about 3 years. She is a rescue dog that we adopted from the local shelter. We recently adopted another dog (Husky) that is 2 years old and we have had her for about 6-7 months. Our dogs get along well with each other and our oldest one has definitely shown she will be the dominate one of the two. They will play with each other and go on walks together with no problem.

My oldest dog has always loved walks and that is usually the only time she would do her business. We would put her on the front porch but she would still never go to the bathroom in the yard, only walks. Our newer dog is just the opposite. She loves walks but usually does not go to the bathroom as she will go in our yard right when she gets outside.

The problem:

Some times when I do not have time to walk both of the dogs, I usually tie them up in the front yard. I do not have a fenced in yard so they would go out one at a time to use the bathroom. Since my oldest dog would not go to the bathroom in the yard, I would have to walk her while my younger dog is tied up in the front yard. Recently when coming home from walks with my older dog, she will not step foot in the yard. She will walk up the driveway instead and even pull away if we try to walk through the yard. Even Before adopting our younger dog, our older one  would never use the bathroom in the front yard; however, she used to enjoy just being out there. That has changed as now she does not want to go in yard or sit on the porch period.

Has anyone gone through a situation like this or have an idea what would be causing her to suddenly switch to hating the yard? I thought it might have to do with our younger dog; however, this only started recently as our older dog enjoyed being in the yard for the first 4-5 months with the younger dog."	dogs
747	[HELP] My dog hates one specific dog and his owner	"My fiancée and I have a 5 year old PBGV (as close as we can tell - he’s a rescue). He loves other dogs and humans and children. There’s just this one guy and his dog who live in our building that our dog hates. The incident that spurred this pre-dates me, but from what I’ve heard the other dog was aggressive and attacked our dog and it has been a nightmare since. Any time we see them (or even just the owner alone) our dog goes crazy. 

It’s really stressful because we see them often coming or going in the building. If we just encountered them on walks they would be easy to avoid, but we really cannot predict when we will run into the owner - especially without his dog. 

Are there ways we can retrain our dog to associate the owner (and hopefully his dog eventually) with something positive so he won’t go insane every time he gets a whiff of them? "	dogs
748	[Help] How can I avoid my dog getting aggressive with other animals?	"I have a 100 pound mastiff, she usually is a very sweet dog. A while ago on her walk she ran up to a raccoon and killed it. I did my best to mediate but was a bit scared just in case the raccoon would attack me but it was already dead.

A couple weeks ago a cat ran up to my dog (( she was on a leash )) and I’m not sure if the cat attempted to scratch her or not but my dog attacked the cat and grabbed it by its neck. I kept tugging on her leash but she just brought the cat along with her, the cat was able to run away unharmed somehow but my dogs aggression is scaring me. How do I mediate when things like this happen? How do I get her to let go when she already has the animal in her mouth? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!!!!  "	dogs
749	[Breeds] Adopting my first doggo	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be my first time owning a dog. I have always had cats growing up, and would only interact with neighbors' dogs. Growing up, I would often dogsit and catsit for any neighbors who would go out of town.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I prefer rescuing a dog so that I may give a homeless dog a home.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would love a dog who gets along with other dogs/cats/people as I have many classmates who also own dogs. I enjoy being active outside, so a friend who would want to walk the beach and visit the local dog park would be awesome. I prefer medium or large dogs as well.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* From my experiences, I love Labs, Golden Retrievers, as well as Australian Shepards, dobermans, and rottweilers. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* It would be nice to have a dog that I could even bike with, if at all possible. I would like to spend time teaching a dog obedience, and maybe even some cool, more ""complex"" tricks as well!

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I could take the dog on 2 to 3 walks each day, and spend time training in the evenings. This could equate to 2 to 4 hours a day, with trips to the dog parks and beaches multiple times a week.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I would say approximately 2 hours or so. I have 2 dogs parks in my apartment complex, one large dog park within 5 minutes, and multiple beaches in the area.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I do not mind brushing or trimming nails included in basic grooming. I would prefer to not have to pay for professional grooming regularly. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I prefer medium to large sized dogs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The barking may have to be kept to a minimum due to my apartment living. I am not the biggest fan of slobber, but could tolerate small amounts. Shedding does not bother me.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I find this very important because I look forward to visiting dog parks and public areas with the pup. In addition, I am sure I will have many play-dates with other dogs in this fashion. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would prefer a more snuggly dog, but a mix of both wouldn't be so bad either.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I feel as though a dog who is eager-to-please may be easier to train, which would be helpful for a first time dog owner like myself.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* If someone knocked on the door, I would like if the dog would not go crazy barking, but maybe be slightly interested in the situation. As for strangers/visitors, I would prefer a calm and sociable dog.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, I would not.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I would want to avoid excessive chewing/marking, but I believe the chewing typically occurs when dogs are bored.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This depends on the day of the week as I have classes. The longest day of classes that I have would be from around 8 till 3. Otherwise, I am home practically everyday by 1, or at least can make a quick trip during the day at noon back to my apartment.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My boyfriend does not care one way or another about adopting a pet of any kind. He would like a dog that ""clicks"" with him when adopting. It is known that the dog would be my financial and time responsibility.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We do plan to have both a dog and a cat at some point down the road. I am interested in adopting the dog now since I believe they fit with my activity level, and we live in a very dog-friendly area.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not really, as I do not have much family in the area. The only children would be ones that would be encountered during walks.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We do currently rent, and the breed restrictions are about 10 breeds including pit bulls, german shepards, american staffordshire terriers, akitas, and other ""aggressive"" breeds. There are no weight restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live on the US East Coast, and I do not know of any breed bans.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* A typical summer day can be around 88 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, while winters are typically 59 to 61 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

750	[Help] Who do I call to come pick up a stray dog?	So there is this dog who started sitting on my front porch yesterday. We just let it be thinking it was lost or something and will go back to its owner, but that wasn’t the case this morning. Now its bothering us and we are struggling to get inside the house because it’s trying to get in. Thanks for the help in advance and I live in the Los Angeles area.	dogs
751	[Discussion] Visiting the local shelters in a few days, to see about adopting a friend for my rescue Jack	"I've had my boy Jack four years now, and he turned ten this year. In those four years he's gone from being Sir Barks-a-lot every time he sees another dog to Sir Wags-a-lot wanting to greet them all.
His puppyhood with other dogs and humans was awful, hence the initial reactiveness, but before we got him he also had a brief stint in a foster home where he lived fine with other dogs too.

And after a lot of months considering the time has come to visit the shelters and see if we can't welcome someone else.

They are good shelters here, everything will be able to be taken at Jack's and any potential dog's paces. The staff will have tons of advice. I feel like I'm prepared for all outcomes but now a visit is imminent to see actual dogs I'd love to hear others experiences of getting a new rescue to join an already established one in the home. I've experience of a multi dog home but only dogs from breeders all pretty much growing up from puppies together.

I guess my main worries are just missing any small signs that Jack isn't happy with the situation once he realises what is going on, especially, and thinking way ahead to a point we may not even reach, if it got to the point of bringing a new dog home. Which again I know the shelter staff will be very helpful with when seeing if there's a good match for us. Whilst I'd love to give another dog a forever home right now, if Jack disapproves it's simply not meant to be which I'm perfectly okay with too as at least we'll have tried."	dogs

753	[Help] Dog forgot housetraining	I have a 9 year old dachshund mix who, up until the last 2 months, was a perfectly housetrained dog since he was a puppy. Since then, , almost every time we leave him alone in the house, even for 30 minutes, he will go to a corner and pee or poop.

754	[Help] Risk of heartworm?	"My dog was free from heartworm two weeks ago when my vet checked him out. I got some heartworm / flee monthly pills, but at the time, they recommended to hold off on those until his kennel cough antibiotics brought him up to speed.

It's been two weeks now, my dog is doing a lot better and is cured from kennel cough symptoms. I gave him the first heartworm pill last night. Is there a significant risk that he may have contracted heartworm in those two weeks? Mostly an inside dog, but I take him out each day.

755	[HELP] My 1.5 yr old whippet mix has never shown aggression before but just attacked 3 dogs	"As the title states, I adopted a whippet mix from a shelter 3 months ago. In the entire time I’ve had her, she avoided any and all conflict, relying on her speed to get out of situations if need be. Today seemed like any other day, come home from work, pick her up, go to the dog park. The difference today is that we get there, and a German Shepherd and maybe 8-9 other dogs are already hanging out. I put my attention on giving her water, but then hear and see her barking, teethed bared, and biting in a way I’ve never seen it before. Thankfully no one was hurt. I wasn’t sure if it was her or the GSD, but I chalked it up as an isolated incident until she started fighting with another dog. I took her on a walk, on-leash, to cool her off, and she seemed to be listening to me once again, so I tried one last time. This time, she was rolling in the grass like her old self, but I guess got startled when a smaller dog came close to sniff her and proceeded to fight and bite this dog. I don’t know what’s gotten into her, but this incident is making me very anxious about how I want to proceed.

A couple things to note:

We very often come to this dog park, but were out of town visiting family this past weekend

She’s generally very shy and meeting a bunch of family members for the first time may have put her on edge 

It is very hot today, around 90 degrees with humidity

We moved to an isolated area of the park leashed for a little while longer before heading home. 

Have any of you experienced this sudden aggression? What’s the best way for me to act in this situation? Any advice would immensely help, thanks.

757	[Help] My dog won’t go potty outside!	My recent rescue will not go potty outside. She was a stray and was abandoned when we found her. We unfortunately then lost her for a week one of the first few weeks we got her when she got spooked while on a walk and slipped out of her collar. She is clearly traumatized and is a huge flight risk and tries to run and hide whenever she is spooked (inside and outside). She’s leash reactive, but need to have one to go outside bc she want to run away and hide if something scares her. Everything scares her though. She is absolutely terrified of going outside, any noises, birds, cats, cars, etc. She won’t take treats when she is outside, so it’s hard to counter condition her. She doesn’t like to potty in the house (holds it sometimes for 48+ hours). We have tried fake grass, potty sheets, etc. It makes it nearly impossible to take her outside to potty though. She hunkers down into her safe zone and won’t budge. She is a medium size dog, so it is hard to comfortably hold her, but we have had to carry her outside to potty. She will go right away and then immediately want to go back inside. Any tips for this? It seems to be hurting our relationship at this point with her, having to pull her from her safe zone to potty. She won’t come to us, she won’t look at us and basically avoids us for the most part. She does explore the house when we are not home though. 	dogs

759	[help] Our dog literally insists upon sleeping in our bed	"My dog is some kind of mystery poodle mix. She is a rescue mutt who was found with her brothers and sisters in some godawful part of Los Angeles. Because I have always rescued older dogs, she was our first puppy so part of it was misunderstanding some things early on that I regret now, and part of it is she seems especially challenging (which may merely be our perception). We are her forever home no matter what happens and we adore her. That out of the way, we could use some help. I've read some useless dog training books and have been watching a lot of YouTube videos that seem equally unhelpful ""Do you have a stubborn dog? Simply train them in exactly the same manner that didn't work for you before! You're welcome.""

I think part of the problem is, she was unintentionally coddled by the various fosters she was initially placed with when she was young. She was most assuredly not kept in a crate at night, but slept with either other humans or other dogs - possibly both. Another more general problem I've noticed is that dog training books and videos are woefully naive, giving people a false sense of what to expect. Everything they say that 'lasts two weeks' they ought to say 'could actually take several months or not work at all'.

Upon arrival with us, she would cry for hours at night when placed in her crate no matter how much exercise she received. This is what I had been led to expect, I thought, no issue. You just wait it out and ignore her, right? This went on for MONTHS. She cried at night no matter what we did. When she finally settled down after an hour, she would sleep for a few hours, need to pee in the middle of the night (which is normal) but then she'd need to go through the process of crying all over again. Yes, we tried putting the crate not in the bedroom at all. She howled louder and longer. After FIVE MONTHS of this we finally broke down and bought a baby bassinet co-sleeper (the kind for actual babies!) so she could sleep in a crate-like environment, but still be at the level of our bed. I even tried keeping one hand on her at night to reassure her that we are right here, right next to her. But every night, she would wait for us to fall asleep, then climb in with us. So every time she did it, we patiently put her back in her bassinet, told her ""stay"" and waited for her to fall back asleep through her crying. But throughout the night, she kept climbing into bed with us. Another several months of this? We stopped correcting her for our own sanity and our own interest in getting enough sleep ourselves. She's now a year old and has been sleeping in our bed for three months now. I'm curious whether there are any alternatives anyone may know about because allowing her to sleep with us wasn't our first choice by far, but it was driving us crazy and we felt like we were out of options. We also tried a trainer who wanted us to dominate the shit out of her, hold her down, bite her ear, etc. But that freaked me out. It felt like she wanted us to traumatize her for the purpose of making her experience Stockholm Syndrome. We would much rather address the root cause. If it were just me, I probably would have gotten her another rescue because part of the problem seems to be she is about a thousand times more extraverted than any other dog I've ever had. She cries when other dogs or human strangers ignore her or don't want to play with her. She has an insatiable desire for the company of other beings. But my partner doesn't think this is a good idea. Honestly, if it were just me, I would have probably just let her cry for YEARS if necessary and worn ear plugs to sleep. But my partner is very sensitive about his sleep and doesn't like ear plugs, so we often ended up relenting for his sake."	dogs
760	[help] Going to adopt a dog - are we a good fit? timing?	"So this is a little bit in the future but I like to plan and be prepared. 

My husband and I want to adopt a dog but we currently live in an apartment where they aren't allowed. We will move to a different city January 15 (roughly) and of course we'll make sure our prospective landlord is okay with our plans of dog ownership. But it'll be in the city (250K inhabitants but very green, lots of parks, pedestrian/bike friendly). And we plan to have a two-bedroom (1 bedroom, one home office for my husband). So it won't be that big, might be on the 5th floor or something, and might not have a balcony.

The standard weekday schedule would be like this:

7 am: 15 min walk

12:30 pm: 15 min walk

5:30 pm: 60-90 min walk, dog park etc.

10 pm: 15 min walk

Is that enough? We'd do more on the weekends when feasible, but there might be days when we're busy and the afternoon walk will be cut short...

We plan to adopt an adult dog, 2 years and up, medium size (between 1 ft and 2 ft). I'm partial to spaniels and setters, but we'll just look for a dog we like and not care too much about breed.

I'll graduate from med school in November and will start my new job on March 1 next year. So from whenever we get the dog to February 28 I could basically hang out with it all day. (My husband works from home, so even when I work long hours, the dog won't have to be alone more than a few hours a few times a week.)

So my question is when the best timing for the adoption of a dog would be? And how far in advance would we have to apply (?) for a dog? Since they usually do a home visit here before approving you for a rescue dog, should we wait till we're settled into the new apartment to apply? (I'm slightly impatient in case you couldn't tell.) On the one hand, I don't wanna stress the dog out by the arrival of a new couch, for example, but I also want to have as much time as possible with the dog before I start my job.

Thoughts? Thanks :)"	dogs

769	[Discussion] Two-year old Golden Retriever refuses to eat from her food bowl.	"I am at a bit of an impasse and thought I would see if anyone else has experienced this or has advice. I have had my girl, Elle, since she was 9 weeks. I have never had an issue with her eating, though she is fairly dainty of an eater, opting to graze throughout the day over scarfing everything in a few minutes. I noticed she hasn’t been eating as much in the last week or so, but has shown high interest in treats and human food. She gets excited when I fill her bowl, but when I place it on the floor during our evening routine, she sniffs near it and backs away from it. I thought maybe it was the food, since we changed a few months ago, but she ate it fine at the start. It had been sitting out for a few days at this point, so I tossed it thinking perhaps it had spoiled in some way? I don’t know, I’m not a dog food expert. But when I went to refill, she reacted excitedly, circling around herself, and when I set it down again, she backed away nervously. So I thought I would offer her a couple of pieces by hand. She took them eagerly. I move the bowl towards her because she seems to be okay eating it, but she jumps back as if she’s afraid of the bowl. I took off her collar, thinking maybe the sound of her dog tags hitting the metal was scary for her, as she frightens easily with loud sounds. She still wouldn’t go near it. I should maybe add that she recently stayed with my parents and her dog tags fell off while there. They fastened them back on with a thick meta wire, and they hang much lower than they used to. So I dumped her food on the floor, and low and behold, she goes straight for it, and ate over half the food in one sitting.

My girl ranges on the pathetic side of the bravery scale. We only use her crate when needed, because she seems to really hate going in it, so we keep it folded up to save space. So when there are loud sounds (I.e. thunder, fireworks, construction), she will hide in the bathtub if we aren’t home. Have I coddled her too much? My fiancé blames her behavior on being “spoiled”, though I would argue she is simply very exceptionally loved. 

Has anybody else experienced this sort of behavior with their dogs? Any advice or thoughts on how to ease her back into eating from her regular bowl? Should I just crack the whip and leave her to eating the food in the bowl as her only option when she gets hungry enough? 

Also, lovely pics of Elle can be found if you go to my page.

770	[Help] Dog is suddenly afraid of men??	I have an 18 month old female lab mix who’s been with me since she was 9 weeks old. We were very conscious about socializing her as a puppy and up until a few months ago have never had any problems - she’s always been friendly to everyone. We got to spend a lot of time together this summer and I’ve noticed when we go out that she’s not as friendly around strangers, particularly men and usually men in hats. She’s never tried to attack anyone but she barks at them when they walk by or come near us. Like I said, this just developed over the last few months. I can’t think of any negative experiences she might have had around men, and it’s not like we ever stopped socializing her. She’s fixed and she doesn’t have any health problems that I know of. I just think it’s strange that she was never scared or wary of anyone (literally everyone was her friend) up until recently. Should I be concerned? What can I do to fix this? I don’t want anyone to be scared of her or think she is aggressive. Thanks 	dogs

My husband and I established that we need a trainer since our shelter dog has shown aggressiveness to other dogs. Trainers have many different methods and before I contact one, I want to know what method is the best.

772	[HELP] Not sure if this is the best place to ask this. But it's about a puppy that will be imported from Romania to the UK. About the KC/Pedigree certificates and if I was to breed it.	"Hello! I have a good Romanian friend which I will be buying a puppy from his litter. He will transport it to the UK for me. Both parents are pedigree and he can show me pictures of their pedigree certificate. However he will not be pedigree registering this litter he is selling to me, I am unsure of why he is not but I know that he said if he was to pedigree register it the puppy will instead be double the price I'll be paying. I am fine with the dog not being pedigree or KC registered, I'm only keeping it as a family pet and will not be doing shows/competitions etc.

​

However I do have a question about breeding. Do breeders care about dog's being registered as KC/pedigree? (This is probably my most important question)

​

For example, if I was to find another same breed or even different breed owner, will they prefer not to breed with my dog since i was unable to make my puppy KC registered? (if it's the case that i am unable to)

​

And if I find an owner that does not care about pedigree/KC will the litter that are born be able to become KC registered or pedigree registered if it's the same breed? (I just realised I haven't mentioned the breed! It's a GSD :P)

​

Can I pedigree register a dog myself (I read/heard it was possible through blood test with DNA sample or something) Or if I only provide images of the documentations (this is probably highly unlikely since they'll want to see it, but maybe if i said I lost it or made up a story etc).

And since he is importing it under the table most likely it will not be KC registered either. Can i KC register the puppy myself, if he provides a picture of the parents pedigree. He will vaccinate the puppy and I will receive all documents of the health of the dog and it will be microchipped aswell.

​

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  

By under the table I mean, he drives to romania and drives back, it's a long trip but it's what he does, he will simply put the puppy in his car and drive with it back to the UK, where it wont be found basically. Atleast that's what he has said, he has also done it before according to him. I trust him and he is my friend, known him for a few years now. 

The breed is german shepherd.

The breeder has registered their dogs, both mother and dad of the puppy is pedigreed and SV registered, some German dog club, he has documentations of this.

​

The dog will also be fully vaccinated and microchipped before he comes into the country with it, and i will recieve a full health book and documentations etc. Meaning rabies, since I read UK is strict as heck on rabies!

773	[Help] My mom won’t let me take my dog with me. read post for context.	"Context:

I’m getting married next month, and moving out to a new home, so the problem I have is with my mom (she’s the best person I know) and she does not want to part ways with my dog. 

She doesn’t want me to take my dog with me for really bs reasons, while I understand that she loves my dog, she needs to understand that so do I. And that wasn't our deal from the beginning (deal was that I take the dog to our home and then, take her when I move out), But I can’t just leave my dog for this reasons:

1) I have a brother who’s a good lad, but he drives a big truck and doesn’t really pay attention to his surroundings when coming home, he’s too reckless and I am affraid he will kill my fog (he already killed my cat accidentally and crippled other)

2) I know that, while my mom lhas the best intentions in her mind, she won’t take the proper care, she never did really with an animal before, a dog of her spent the last times of her life very sick due to poor care, (cancer) and partly because she works so much and doesn’t really have the time and proper knowledge to do so.

How can I talk her out and convince her to let me take my dog withouh creating too much drama?

It's not constant but he does it every 5-10 minutes; especially when he's laying down.

He doesn't seem to have any other symptoms other than the snorting.

778	Dog maybe having separation anxiety? Advice and help needed! [Help]	"My dog is in a flat house for the first time in his life. We occasionally hear someone walking around and sometimes he growls and barks at the noises. Not always. I hope he gets used to them quickly. I usually use the quiet command and he stops. 

When I leave, he whines at the door. I've watched from Skype that he does it 0 minutes in the evenings and 5-20 in the daytime. At first he runs to his bed, sleeps, runs to the door and sleeps there and again and again. He sleeps maybe few minutes at the time. Then he stops and sleeps in front of the door, sometimes raises his head and might let out one bark but doesn't whine. When I come back, he is quiet. He might just sleep there for hours.

Does he have separation anxiety? Can I make this easier somehow for him? I thought about an 1-1.5 hour walk in the mornings and then leaving him with something to chew on like his morning food in a kong or a dry pig ear. I feel like he might not have separation anxiety, he is just getting used to a new situation? Should I ask for sedatives for him to calm him? He is 7 months old golden retriever and started guarding only a month ago, before we moved. He was fine being alone in our previous home, but would also sometimes whine when I left. It's more like a protest: ""hey, you forgot me!"" When he is scared or needs to pee he sounds totally different. He also lets me go to toilet alone and doesn't whine after me then. He is definitely stressed in this new apartment."	dogs
779	[Discussion] Sometimes you do everything “right” and it still goes wrong.	"I came to his subreddit asking to learn about breeders and pure breads and to be lead away from doodles several months ago. You guys convinced me. I did further research and took all the tips into account and at the start of the summer we brought home a beautiful Portuguese Water Dog who’s 110% fluff and 120% personality. We love her very much. [here she is checking to see if mom’s book is any fun to play with!](https://m.imgur.com/a/5gb7ZQo)

We found an AKC registered breeder with a litter in the correct timeframe. She checked all the boxes - only has 1-2 litters a year. Shows/titles her dogs. Did all the appropriate health testing for the breed. Had a waiting list (but someone on the list wanted to wait for a later litter and we lucked out on our pup). Very thorough application process for us, with multiple interviews - by phone as she’s seven hours away. Hundred+ pages of new owner education we had to go through before pickup and even more we went home with. Even needed to prove income to show we’d be able to support puppy, and of course there was a takeback clause in contract if for any reason we ever couldn’t.

We bought pet insurance and all the equipment we could possibly need. We take her everywhere Nd treat her better than some people I know treat their human children. We followed all the “rules” in the puppy books for socializing, vaccinating, puppy classes, etc.

Puppy still has some kind of congenital issue. She can’t swallow food or water well. No one has been able to tell why. She drinks from a rabbit water bottle and is hand fed small bites of soft food like eggs, mulTiple times a day. She coughs constantly. Immediately after eating or drinking she coughs up whatever she attempted to get down, along with gastric juice and saliva. She’s had two sinus infections requiring heavy antibiotics from fluids/food backing up into her sinus cavities at not even five months old and has been at the vet’s on antibiotics and iv fluids since Friday morning - it’s now Monday afternoon. She has pneumonia. We visited today and she’s doing much better, is acting more herself and we hope she’ll be well enough to come home in a few days. She’s ten pounds behind her siblings in bodyweight due to her challenges with eating, even though she started out in the middle of the litter.

This probably should have been a vent post, but I wanted it to stay open for other experiences or advice. We’ve seen four vets. We’re seeing two different specialists when she pull through this pneumonia to see if they can tell us anything. We did and are doing everything we know to have done, but the thing we’ve learned with our princess is that there are no guarantees. Our girl is a fighter, and we’re going to keep fighting for her too as long as we can. But all we’ve learned so far is that even if you do everything the right way, things can still go wrong. Everyone, just give your pups a hug for me."	dogs

Hello!!

​

I'm  getting a pupper soon, like withing a month or two, and I've been scouring the web on how to do this the right way.  The thing is there's a LOT of conflicting info from a lot of different places, especially around training.

​

I've had animals before, grew up with a cat and dog, I had a lizard as well, and I'm not new to caring for animals, but I want to go into this as up to date and prepared as possible.  I know that the whole ""alpha"" pack training thing is bunk but what would be the best resource on proper training methods and other dog care?  I don't know how much to trust the various dog-centric websites I've found.  A lot of them contradict each other or have info that feels pretty old-school, treating pets like property and less like companions, while others feel like the info was put together by people who seem to think  that anything beyond pampering your dog like royalty at all times is tantamount to abuse.

​

So!    Where do I look?  Who are some good actual \_authorities\_ on dog  behavior, training and health?  Who should I trust to give me quality,  up-to date information on raising and caring for a fuzzy companion?

​

Oh!  I suppose I should mention I'm looking a lot at getting a Male Dane, though that isn't totally set in stone if I fall in love with another pooch first!"	dogs

786	[Help] Dog acting strange after badly injuring himself and getting stitches	" On Sunday afternoon, we noticed that our dog (Alaskan Malamute x German Coolie) had some blood on his fur. Upon further inspection we found a rather large gash on his shoulder area that looked like it went pretty deep.

​

He didn't cry/whimper, didn't show any signs of pain and was acting the same as normal. When I went over to have a closer look, he rolled over for a belly rub like he always does. He seemed fine.

​

We quickly rushed him to an emergency vet who gave him a bunch of injections, anti-biotics and 14 stitches.

​

When we got him home again, he was pretty dopey but the next day and today he has been acting really weird. He's constantly sitting in random spots all over the house. Spots he's never sat in before, including spots he knows that he's not allowed in (and has never tried going there after learning that).

​

For example he knows he's not allowed upstairs but we've found him going upstairs multiple times, sitting in random places. Not just during the day too; we found him wandering around and sitting in random spots upstairs at like 3am last night.

​

It's not just random places he's sitting, but he also just isn't acting himself. I don't really know how to describe it other than saying he's just acting very weird and out of character.

​

Not sure if this is relevant, but we took his collar off to give the wound more breathing room and just to make him feel a bit more comfortable.

​

Do you guys know why he might be acting like this? Is there anything we can do for him?

​

Also, you might be wondering how he injured himself in the first place. So are we... We believe he did it in our backyard but we dog-proofed our backyard for our previous dog and I scoured our backyard on Sunday afternoon for about an hour looking for what could have done it and there was nothing that stuck out to me. I think it must have been a particularly sharp branch that he ran into while running around but I couldn't find one with blood or fur on it.

787	[Help] Owning a puppy while working full-time	"I'm thinking with my schedule it will be best to get a more established older dog, however, I'm wondering IF it is possible and reasonable to potentially adopt a puppy. 

I work full time and just started my new schedule, 8:30-5. After a few weeks I am going back to my old schedule, 8-430. I live 30 minutes from my job, so in the mornings I leave an hour earlier than when my hours start, so I'm leaving at either 7 am or 7:30 due to bad rush hour traffic. In the evenings it takes me 30-45 minutes to get home. I have weekends off.

My roommate currently works part-time so is home more often during the week. However she is in the process of getting a full-time job and is most likely getting hired sometime in the next few weeks. She will have similar working hours to me, with weekends off, so it's not like we can take care of puppy during alternating days. 

My mom has agreed to take the puppy for a max of two days a week, which I really appreciate. She stays home and has two other dogs, so puppy will have lots of socialization and play time. However that leaves 3 days of the week where puppy will be alone for 9-10 hours. Of course when I get home (or if my roommate gets home earlier than I do) puppy will get as much playtime and interaction as possible before bedtime (which is usually around 10-10:30 pm). On the weekends I would be spending as much time as possible with the puppy. I don't usually have action-packed weekends, I like to spend time chilling in my apartment and hanging out with family or a few friends or something. 

The puppy in question is, I believe, about 2.5-3 months old. She is very new to the rescue and has been at the vets' for the past few days, so no one knows much about her yet. A foster had her for a little while before she went to the vet, so I'm not sure how far she has progressed in crate-training, if at all. She is getting out of the vets' tonight, so I will learn more about her tonight or sometime tomorrow. 

Provided I keep her in a safe room (I have a decently sized laundry room) for those 3 days, with her crate door open and puppy pads on the floor so she doesn't pee/poop in her crate and ruin the crate training, does this sound like a decent plan? Is three days out of the week with most of those 3 days being spent alone too much alone time for a puppy that young? 

If it's too much and won't work--don't worry, I don't have the puppy and have not gone through the adoption process. I'm just entertaining the idea for now. If it won't work then it won't work, and I'll keep an eye out for an adult dog. 

Thanks for any tips or advice. "	dogs

I have tried almost everything, I filled her kong with a treat and peanut butter, got her the thunder shirt, got that scent Pheromone diffuser, the ultrasonic anti bark box and nothing has worked to stop her from freaking out. I have had to start locking her back in her kennel when we leave because she has been shitting and pisssing when we are gone.

789	[Help] When do you know it is time to put down your companion?	"Hi Everyone, 

to give you all a bit of context, my husband and I have an almost 11 years old pure breed Newfoundlander. We've had him since he was 9 weeks and he has been the most wonderful companion we could ever ask for...minus for the many health issues. For a quick summary: he has been dealing with serious skin problem since he was approximately 6 months and this has been an ongoing issue at least 6x a year. He also got a knee surgery at 2yo, then another surgery around 5 for a lump on his paw, he got diagnosed with a cancerous lump on his neck at 8 yo which they completely removed and he has been in remission since and for the past 6 months now, we've noticed that he has a lot of difficulty getting up and he has been dragging his legs more and more...we've also noticed that he's panting loudly by just getting up but yet, he has never complained. The vet saw him every month for the past year and at our last visit, she confirmed that even though his blood tests are fine, he is declining and last month she brought up how she is seeing his quality of life declining and we should start preparing ourselves. We know it's coming, but we don't know how far we should go. We always said: ""When Pablo won't be able to do what he loves: going for walks, for rides and going up the stairs, we'll know it's time!"" Well at this point, he can't go for walks anymore, but if we would ask him to go, he would gladly go and push himself to the max. Today I brought him for a ride and he got really excited but during the ride, I could see he was struggling standing up and he ended up just laying down between the 2 front seats. He's a newf so he has never been super active to begin with, but seeing him struggling with these simple things makes me terribly sad. I don't want him to become just a ""carpet"", but he still picks up his toys once in a while and will try to play tug with us. We've also tried pain medication for a month to see if we would notice a difference but nop, not really. 
People around us see the difference, and we do too, but it is really hard to make a final decision when he still shows some excitement for things he loves...even though he can't really enjoy them anymore. 

So here we are...seeing our perfect puppy slowly degrading and not knowing when it's time to let him go. I would like to know what would convince you it's time to let him go?

It's the exact same bowl from her previous family, and she seems to drink water just fine. We reached out to her previous owners, and they said she was free eating two whole bowls a day. We also learned that she had issues eating at the home before them, as another dog was stopping her from eating. We don't have any other dogs that might be stopping her, and we try to give her space once we realize she's interested in her food. Previously, I've had some luck getting her to eat out of my hand, or sometimes I will sit down at her food bowl with her and she will finally eat. 

She is getting more daily activity than her previous home (part of the reason they adopted her out - she was getting two walks per week if she was lucky). She came back from her walks today and had water just fine. She seems totally fine personality wise. She gets excited throughout the day, walks are good and exciting for her, she seems to sleep just fine. Is this just an adjustment period or should I be more concerned?"	dogs
798	[Help] Kelpie Cross having stomach issues	"My partner and i have a 3 year old kelpie cross, for the past 2-3 months he's been throwing up and having the runs a lot almost 2-3 times a week.

We took him to the vet and he said to put him on a low fat diet consisting of chicken breast and rice. but that still hasn't fixed the issue. 
Im planning on taking him to the vet again in a few days, im thinking something more sinister is wrong with him, possibly stomach cancer? 

Has anybody here experienced this before? 
Any help is much appreciated :) "	dogs
799	[Discussion] Can Humans Safely eat dog chicken jerky?	"Hey all, so I'm a batsh\*t crazy bodybuilder whose looking for an efficient source of protein.

Back at home, I would make copious amounts of chicken jerky as a way to get in insane amounts of protein.  Now that I'm away at college, it's not as practical for me to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

My solution was to buy chicken jerky.  As it turns out, most people don't eat chicken jerky, and it's really more a dog thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is, are there any cheap brands of chicken jerky that are safe for humans to eat?**

800	[help] my dog is still bored...	"So in the last few weeks I’ve stepped up my dogs exercise routine a lot but he is still bored. Last night while I was sleeping he ate the corner of the bed and threw up. 

We run for 30 minutes 3 days a week, and then on the days we don’t run we walk for an hour minimum. I’m working on being able to run more using the c25k app but I’m surprised he’s still this bored. 

What else can I do?"	dogs
801	[Breed] Searching for my ideal dog breed!	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog that is entirely my own. I grew up with a Border Collie, and as a teenager my family got an Australian Shepherd that I was partially (maybe about 60-70%?) responsible for training and taking care of until I moved away.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Probably a breeder although I would be open to the right rescue dog... but don't want to run into behavioural/health issues. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Definitely a companion first, I want a dog that cares about me and wants to be near me most of the day. I would love to have a cuddly dog! However, I also run and hike frequently and would love a dog that could go on 5-10k runs and frequent long hikes as well. So a mix of active and lazy, I suppose. I want a dog that can do things with me, but will have a good off-switch when we are not being active and will be happy to just be pet. Preferably mid-sized. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I do love Border Collies and Aussies but I think their personalities are a bit too intense for me - and neither of the ones we had would ever sit still or let you pet them for any amount of time (that might have just been them though!) Other dogs I have thought of: Nova Scotia Duck Toller - not sure if they would have too much drive for me though, Finnish Lapphund, I love the personality of Italian Greyhounds but think I would want something that can be outside and in the cold more, Corgi, Shikoku, Samoyed if I wanted something bigger. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Definitely puppy obedience and basic training, but I'm also looking into agility, more intense obedience/tricks, and potentially dock diving if I had something like a Toller. Not too interested in competitions, but just training for fun. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours? I would ideally have a dog that would like to be near me (eg. on the couch) where I could also spend time idly petting it but not intensely paying attention to it. This would be extra time on top of actual training/playing. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Daily exercise would ideally be 30 min - 1 hour, with more on weekends. At least walks every day, with runs and hikes 2-3 times a week. I live very close to a dog park so would love to be able to take a dog there, and also live close to several large off-leash trails. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am very open to grooming myself or taking the dog to a groomers!

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Ideally somewhere around a border collie or slightly smaller, but not tiny. Let's say corgi - border collie range.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, barking is okay if it's not constantly, not a fan of slobber though! 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is fairly important to me but potentially not a complete dealbreaker. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly as they come! Or at least likes being nearby. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Definitely eager to please. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't need a guard dog, so anywhere from indifference / cautiousness to friendliness is good with me! I would like if my dog likes visitors but it's not super important for me to have the golden retriever ""everyone is my best friend"" personality. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression, like I said above, I would like to have a dog I could walk off-leash and not worry about it running away. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not very long, maybe a few (3-4) hours a day on average. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I wouldn't rule out a cat in the future but have no current plans of getting one. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Renting, no restrictions though. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Canada - my province has no bans. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is usually fairly mild with weather 20-25 Celsius (~65 - 80 fahrenheit)? Winter can get down to 0-10 Celsius (~30 - 50 fahrenheit). It rains a lot.  

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  "	dogs
802	[Breeds] which breed is right	Hi, I am looking to get a dog in the next year and am trying to decide on the correct breed. I am looking for a medium to large sized dog that isn't necessarily a guard dog but is loyal and will protect me and the house if need be. I also have 3 cats that I would like the dog to get along with and I also know that alot of that had to do with training. A few breeds that I've had in mind are blue heelers, Akitas, boxers, and collies. If you have any other input or suggestions Id love to hear them! 	dogs

804	[Help] My aunts dog attacked another dog, why?	"So, today my aunts dog attacked another dog (both dogs are okay, the smaller one was taken to the vet) that was a lot smaller than my aunts dog. I’m pretty sure she’s a Mastiff Lab breed but I’m not so sure on it. But anyways, she jumped out of the window and attacked a smaller dog for almost no reason at all. At my aunts place she gets along well with 2 cats, another dog and a bunny. She is 3 years old so is a bit young. But why would she attack another dog? ( to clarify it was sort of my fault because I had left her leash because I had no intent on actually walking her, just took her for a ride. ) The only way she was also able to let go of the dog was hitting her with a stick but she still kept going for the smaller one, even after getting kicked, eventually the police came in and tazed her. 

Both dogs are fine, sorry for repeating but, my aunts dog is still a little scared and from what I hear is the little one is okay. "	dogs
805	[Help] What med/large breed for house with children?	I am looking to get my son, who is five, a puppy for Christmas. I personally have owned and cared for a husky, lab, beagle, and a pug. I want something one the medium to large size, something that him and I could do a lot of outdoor activities with. We have a decent size home and a quarter acre lot that is next to a dog park. I want to stick away from the labs/retrievers and find something a little more ‘unique’. I do not want a husky again, I can clean up some shed but that was just a nightmare to deal with. Also no bully breeds, as we have recently experienced a loss of a child my sons age at the temperament of a Pitt bull. 	dogs
806	[Help] Walking with 1 year old Great Dane	My mom recently rescued a Great Dane puppy at the end of April this year and she’s now a little over one. We’re used to having dogs, we’ve been at 3 at a time for like a decade. Our Doberman died so my mom was uncomfortable without a guard dog, but she watches my baby nephew everyday so we needed a gentle but scary sounding dog. The Great Dane fell into her lap from a lady going through a divorce. My mom had Great Danes as a child and in her 20s but it’s been a while. The dog is great, she latches onto me and my mom like no other ( she’s the true definition of a velcro dog). She still wants to play and gets excited when people come over which we understand since she’s a puppy, but my mom has some issues with walking her. She does this thing where she like stands up like a horse on her hind legs?Or at least that’s how my mom describes it lol. She does it anytime she sees a dog and while it’s not in a malicious way, you don’t want your dog to be doing that, especially one that’s 103 pounds. I’m away at college so I was wondering if anyone had some advice for me to give my mom. She’s trained all our dogs and would never pay someone to train them (she’s very do it yourself haha) so if there’s any tips or anyone who’s familiar with Great Danes I’d appreciate it.	dogs

809	[Help] My dog has a sudden limp	After camping this weekend and coming home late Sunday, I noticed that my 11 month golden retriever had a slight limp on her back right leg this morning. I had just spent a very long time brushing her to try and help with the crazy shedding so I figured maybe her leg had fallen asleep or something so I didn’t really think anything of it. Later today I took her and my boyfriend’s dogs to the park and I noticed that she wasn’t nearly as energetic as normal and though the limp was very slight, she had some difficulty moving around. This evening, we had guests over and it took her forever to get up, so her leg is definitely causing her some pain. She slept most of the evening and didn’t really greet anyone, which is highly unusual for her. I felt her whole leg and foot and didn’t see anything. She didn’t seem to be in pain when I was feeling her leg, so I’m just not sure what could be going on. Her limp was much worse this evening and she won’t put her full weight on it. I was thinking that since we were camping this weekend and did a lot of hiking and swimming that she may just be sore (but it doesn’t really make sense for it to just be one leg) or have gotten stung or bit (but I didn’t see or feel anything when I checked), so I’m just not really sure what’s going on. My current plan is to wait a couple days and if she’s still limping I will bring her to the vet. Does this sound reasonable? Does anyone have any other ideas as to why she may be limping all of a sudden? She does get flea/tick and heartworm prevention and is vaccinated against Lyme disease. Thanks for any insight! 	dogs

812	[Breeds] We are getting a dog, I would love to hear people’s opinions on finding a suitable breed.	"I posted on r/Dogtraining asking for advice regarding training a 13 week vs a 8 week old puppy. One kind redditor suggested I fill this out to find a easier breed to start with. 

All thoughts on suitable breeds appreciated!

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder but open to rescue. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Happy, stable, likes being inside and outside of the house, smart, calm but likes to play, affectionate without sitting on me.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Rottweiler: I like how they look, that they are smart and trainable. All rotties I’ve met have been lovely, calm and friendly dogs. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Obedience, tricks, would like to do a dog sport (haven’t decided which yet as I was very convincingly talked down from Schutzhund)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Hour in the morning and 1-2 hours in the afternoon. Inside/outside dog. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same as above, the total time would be split between training &amp; exercise. Playing catch and going for walks would be the main physical exercise along with some sort of dog sport. Hiding food around, frozen treats, puzzles for food would be main mental exercise other than the training itself. Dog park if I found one where I would be confident my dog wouldn’t get injured. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Have 2 cats, they get brushed when they are moulting. Used to trimming nails and other grooming. The cats get a bath as required (they don’t like it but they live and I don’t get mauled). Would prefer a short coat with minimal regular brushing outside of moulting. Happy to pay for hair trimming as required as I have no hairdressing skills. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to Large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: there is at least one bit of cat fur on everything we own. It can not be escaped. Rollers are our best friends. Barking: medium to low. The preference would be for the dog to be trained not to bark outside of play or warning. Slobber: on the low end of medium to low if that makes sense. We all drool sometimes but no ropes of drool from jowls to puddle on the floor. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not particularly. Yard will be fenced and my personal  preference is for the dog to be on a leash when outside for their safety. Would like to do a dog sport so I’m not sure what level is actually required. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Bit of both. I don’t want a large dog that only wants to sit/lie on top of me, I don’t weigh enough to survive it lol. I would like a dog that is happy to be chill next to me or head in lap or leaning on me. I don’t get upset if they want/need personal space, neither of the cats is a lap cat but will sit next to you and have pats when they feel like it. They follow us around when they want pats. Affectionate but not needy I guess is the best description. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Bit of both. No Maremma level of do your own thing  but also not a dog that wants to please anyone and anything.  I guess I would prefer a dog that trusts/obeys me and my partner but is not interested in others. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Not react to knocking or bark a couple of times. Entering yard, bark, lots of bark. Bark for days. Prefer a dog that has no real interest in strangers and is fine to have visitors but again no real interest in them. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Within reason. I would really like to do some sort of dog sport, presumably there are other dogs at clubs so preferably no aggression towards other dogs. It is important they they are not aggressive towards cats. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I don’t know all the possible behaviors so it’s difficult to tell. I don’t want a dog that jumps on people to say hi. No dogs with too much energy (I’m not a runner). 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Monday to Friday for about 9 hours. We have always had someone live in our house when we are on holidays to look after the cats so that would continue. Don’t like boarding. Am open paying for a an additional walker but prefer not. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Partner, also wants a large dog, regular involvement for the first 6-12 months then a job with lots of travel so I have to be able to manage the dog on my own. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 2 cats (British shorthair &amp; Ragdoll) male, desexed, inside only. They are non negotiable as part of the family. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent. There are no restrictions as we will not be living in apartments. We already have to live in pet friendly houses as we have cats. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Will be in Brisbane Australia. Banned: American pit bull terrier; dogo Argentino; fila Brasiliero; Japanese tosa; Perro de Presa Canario; Pit bull terrior (sic); Presa canario. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 30/22 degrees Celsius and humid and winter 21/10. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Happy to answer questions. Not sure what else to include. 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* I would love to hear people’s opinions on what would be a suitable breed. "	dogs

814	[Help] poor golden has an abscess	"So my big happy 2 year oldgolden grew an abscess between his toes a few weeks ago and the vet believed it to be cheat grass. She tried to remove it but couldn't find any but none the less patched him up and put him on antibiotics. 

A few weeks have passed and now he has a new abscess on the bottom of his paw. I'm hoping to get him in tomorrow (they weren't open today for labor day). I'm worried that it could be the cheat grass traveling or maybe some sort of bad spider bite. Is there anything I can do for him tonight to ease his discomfort? I've been applying ice, lots of love and gave him one of the old pain pills I had from his initial appointment as well as a light numbing spray.

Thanks!!"	dogs
815	[Help] My first puppy - Am I on the right track with training?	"I am raising my first puppy ever and I always feel like I'm worrying about doing the right thing. He is about 13-14 weeks now and to be honest he has been such a good boy.

We live in an apartment, so we are using pee pads right now. I know that not everyone agrees with it, but honestly it has prevented so many accidents. He goes on the pee pad I would say 55% of the time, 40% outside and I would say maybe 5% accidents. Accidents rarely happen, though, it has been a little over a week now since he's had one. I would like to take him outside more, to be honest, but we were told by our vet that parasites were really bad right now so we are mostly trying to keep him inside right now just to be safe. 

The biting was a little bit discouraging at first... I definitely got some pretty bad cuts from him, but I've been focusing on positive reinforcement, not getting frustrated, approaching him with toys and working on bite inhibition. He has improved a lot, though! And he is now starting to roll on his back for belly rubs with little to no biting. Now when he bites it's pretty gentle and if he starts to bite harder I just say gentle or ouch and he stops. 

When we first got him we received a lot of unsolicited advice about how to discipline him. I had done a LOT of research beforehand and I have never agreed with punishing a dog, especially a puppy. One coworker in particular stated I should do alpha rolling, which I completely disagree with. Instead I have been focusing on positive reinforcement and giving him lots and lots of treats. I mostly give him the dehydrated chicken and beef liver treats or a bit of his kibble. 

Training-wise he has been so eager to learn and please and I'm so proud whenever he gets down a new command. So far sit is super strong - basically anytime he wants anything now he will sit first. We also make sure to make him sit and stay before we give him his food. He also knows stay pretty well, down, come (still working on his recall), drop it, paw, and he now knows roll over! We're also working now on getting him to follow through commands in distracting environments and work on his recall. 

So far we haven't noticed any food/resource guarding. We put our hands in his food while he is eating, take away his toys and give it back (drop it/fetch) and he is not aggressive whatsoever. 

We have also been socializing him as much as possible. He has met so many people and is so friendly to them. He is surprisingly really good with kids as well! We have also introduced him to as many vaccinated dogs as possible and he is very good with them so far, too. He has not been aggressive at all.

Again, this is my first puppy and I feel like raising a dog is so stressful because you are the determining factor in how they act when they are older. I read a quote that one year of training is what determines if your dog is well behaved for a lifetime. I just wanted to go over what I have done so far and see if there is anything else I can be working on. I love this puppy so much and I would really do anything for him.

818	Need [help] with problem dog and boyfriend	"I never thought I could or would ever hate a dog. I actually never imagined that I would hate any animal - I love them all from fur to scales. But here I am, scouring the internet for all the “Help: I hate my boyfriend’s dog” articles.

&amp;#x200B;

I’d like to start out with my history, as I know if someone doesn’t have dog “sense”, dogs just aren’t going to work out for them. I however, have years and years of dog sense. It’s not just owning dogs - I mean, I have \*worked\* with dogs. I did obedience and dog showmanship as a kid and agility with herding breeds throughout my life. I’ve owned hunting, toy, herding, rescues, mutts, etc. from my childhood up through my adulthood. Training has been my passion and my absolute favorite. I’ve worked in vet clinics, volunteered at shelters, and just three years ago started my own pet sitting business consisting of dog training. I understand dogs and I understand this one I’m having a problem with… so the problem? I can’t stand this dog. And quite frankly, I don’t even want to work with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Meet Charlie: A seven year old rescue border collie/australian shepherd. As you probably already know, Charlie is not my dog. To be entirely honest, if Charlie were my dog, I wouldn’t need to write this article. Because Charlie would have been properly trained. Charlie belongs to my boyfriend and my boyfriend rescued this dog when he was a year old. \*But\* those who know border collies and australian shepherds know that these can be difficult breeds if there is no mental and physical stimulation for the breed(s). And if you don’t provide that, I’m not sure you’re doing those breeds any favors. Charlie is highly reactive toward other dogs, people, and anything that has wheels. It’s not just barking - it’s like an ear splitting whine/bark that makes everyone stop what they’re doing and look at you. He also has separation anxiety which results in urinating/defecating in the house, chewing, tearing into the trash (though he’ll get in there even if you’re standing beside it), and barking/screaming at the door when you leave. Now, I’m not so much annoyed at these behaviors because it’s truly not his fault. His mind just doesn’t understand how to remain calm in these situations that basically cause him to stress. Really, my annoyance is directed toward my boyfriend who comforts/babies Charlie when he performs these bad behaviors. I mean, yes, it is annoying that a motorcycle can’t drive by without this dog running to my window and knocking over my plants to scream at something that will literally disappear in 5 seconds. So what annoys me? The things this dog can control. Like his bladder, for one. Okay? This dog is medium sized. He’s not a small dog with a bladder the size of a bean. He’s able to be put away at night (he’s put into a room at night because he gets on furniture, into the trash, and will try to hurt my free roam bunny) and let out when we decide to get out of bed in the morning. But nope! He’ll wake you up at 7am (we get out of bed at 9am latest) and screams until you let him out. If you don’t, he’ll pee or poop on the floor. Water and food is put up after he’s last taken out to potty before bed so I honestly don’t believe he can’t hold it. Why does he do it? Because he literally has to have all the attention. Every. Second. If not? Whining/screaming over and over again, even if you tell him no, right in your face. I wish you guys could hear this bark, honestly. I understand that dogs can’t talk and barking is the closest way to tell us that they need something but honestly? I refuse to revolve my existence around this dog. I’ll play fetch with my dog but after we come inside, I expect him to go lay down and chill by himself. Speaking of which, I have my own dog. He’s also seven years old and is a shepherd/husky mix. He’s also a rescue and I also got him when he was a year old. He was crazy, just like Charlie, but you want to know the difference? I trained him. I researched the breed (never owned a husky), I taught him basic manners, I taught him tricks, I went on hikes with him, but most importantly - I had the time for this dog. My boyfriend has worked 7am-5pm this entire dog’s life and it infuriates me because it is ridiculously unfair to the dog. And pretty selfish, if you ask me. Charlie follows my boyfriend around and demands my boyfriend’s attention 24/7. And my boyfriend just eats it up like halloween candy. They’re constantly tearing through the house, scratching up the floors while Charlie constantly barks, steals someone’s socks, takes my dog’s toys and tries shredding them, and when things are quiet - Charlie comes and demands it all over again. Honestly, I feel terrible for hating this dog, but his face is something just makes my blood boil. I have NEVER experienced this before. I’ve stayed weeks at a client’s house with up to four dogs at a time and never ever have met a dog that I absolutely can not stand. Just one thing I’d like to mention is that I also have a 3 month old holland lop rabbit - maybe you all are dog people but I’ll tell you a few things about rabbits. These guys are FRAGILE. And I’m not just saying that because I want to blame the dog more - I mean these fellows can have a heart attack just by dogs barking. If they get hit too hard in the neck/back area, it can completely fracture their spine. If chased by a predator, because they are obviously prey animals, they can flip on their backs and go into a immobile state. Also can result in a heart attack. My dog, Bowie, the shepherd/husky can be left alone with my rabbit and I 100% know that nothing would ever happen. We’ve had rabbits before, we’ve fostered kittens, and have taken in orphaned/injured wildlife when I volunteered for the wildlife center. He’s so gentle with her. But Charlie? Charlie screams when he sees her, tries chasing her (he’s always contained), and literally has no self control around her, or, with anything. I know it’s natural instinct because dogs are predators. And maybe that’s what you all will tell me. But guess what? Bowie has a bigger prey drive than Charlie. Rabbits, cats, deer, wildlife outside of our home? Fair game. But Bowie, again, is trained. His loyalty toward me is stronger than that prey-drive. We’re a team. I understand that Bowie isn’t a human and I don’t treat him like a baby - but he is a living thing and deserves respect. That’s what I give him and he rewards me with loyalty. My boyfriend just doesn’t understand that with Charlie - he doesn’t understand that dogs actually need and thrive with leadership.

​

The worst part? I am fully capable of training this dog. I am. I understand why he is reactive and I know why dogs get separation anxiety. I’ve desensitized plenty of reactive and fear aggressive dogs BUT they haven’t been personal. I didn’t live with these dogs. My animals were not at risk when it came to me training these dogs and honestly, I do it for work. Charlie is personal. My boyfriend and I are about to move into a home together and honestly, I can’t even be excited because of this dog. It makes me so sad. I’ve tried to love him - I really have. But between his bad manners and my boyfriend’s bad training, it’s become unbearable to even be around this dog. Now, Charlie has stayed with me for a week and we did some training. He was introduced to a gentle leader and taught “heel”, “look”, “touch”, and “leave it”, which he learned all very quickly. He’s an intelligent dog - truly. He just doesn’t get the physical and mental stimulation that’s required for his breed(s). He was taught “go lay down” when I wanted alone time or when I left the house. He stopped reacting toward the motorcycles, bikes, people, etc that passed by my window. He very rarely reacts anymore. So that’s an improvement and I recognize that. He stopped waking me up in the morning with his yapping and I made him wait until I was ready to get up and that was when he wasn’t barking/whining. I made sure to always reward the desired behavior and honestly, it went very well. He was the calmest I’ve ever seen him. Our walks were sometimes rough but he did very well in heel position. I live in a small town, two hours away from my boyfriend, and there are a lot of triggers here. I used commands like “look”, “touch” and “leave it” to focus his energy on other things when we came near a trigger. In the beginning, he had meltdowns but there were times we would see a bicycle in the distance and he wouldn’t even react. We had a cat meowing and following us for a block and this dog did AMAZING. I was so proud of him. I loved him for his progress. To be entirely honest, he listens to me way better than he does with my boyfriend. I don’t let him beg or have table scraps, I didn’t let him on my furniture, and honestly - I just didn’t baby him. I then gave my boyfriend “homework” after my week with Charlie was up and that’s where it all went crashing down. I would see Charlie right at my boyfriend’s feet, begging. We would video chat and Charlie would be on the bed. My boyfriend wasn't giving him the mental or physical stimulation that he needed. And then I just stopped wanting anything to do with Charlie. I know it’s not Charlie’s fault and it’s my boyfriend’s own but… he still affects my life, animals and space. I don’t want to have to lock my bunny in a room because Charlie will hurt her. I don’t want to leave the room when I’m trying to relax because Charlie is screaming at something. I don’t want to come home to a chewed couch or urine on the floor or that sort of stress after an already stressful day. And honestly, this would be more about my boyfriend and his actions, but everything is literally so great when Charlie isn’t around. I struggle trying to envision how Charlie even benefits my boyfriend because he’s just… obnoxious all the time. But at the same time, that’s not really my place, I suppose. I’m just not sure on what I should do. I’ve communicated with my boyfriend, obviously, because he was given homework - he knows that there is an immense amount of stress built up between me and Charlie. But again, he’s not my dog? So should I just not be bothered? Isn’t it not my place to be offering training tips, etc when he’s not my dog? Do I isolate myself? I mean, what do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m sorry this is so long. I just feel terrible about this whole situation… should I try and get my boyfriend to hire a trainer? He said he tried hiring one years ago but the guy basically said that he wasn’t able to work with Charlie. Which, I mean, I’m not sure about that. I have training experience but I’ve never went to school for it and I saw incredible results just from one week of working with Charlie. I’m pretty anxious about having to mention anything to my boyfriend, and I try to not let things bother me, but it just sort of bottles up inside of me and then I can’t stand to be around either. It sort of just turns into anger and then I’ll cry because I’m just not sure what to do about Charlie or my boyfriend. My boyfriend said that he would try and make things work when we move and if they didn’t, he would rehome Charlie. Which makes me feel even worse because I don’t want it to come down to that. I can’t stand the dog but I am sympathetic to him.I don’t know. Anybody have advice or can you share any similar experiences you may have?"	dogs

820	[Help] Puppy buyer etiquette	So I’ve done all my research, picked a breed, and gotten in contact with some recommended breeders. I got lucky and seemed to hit it off with the first one I contacted who even has a litter on the ground (this was mentioned upfront). However, the catch seems to be that the litter is elsewhere with the mother dog’s co-owner. I don’t think I’ve been ruled out but I also haven’t paid a deposit or been put officially on any sort of waiting list. I’m kinda wondering how this process works now ... the puppies should be five weeks old so would I expect to find out if I’m getting a puppy the week they go home (10 weeks or so) or should I assume that I already am? How appropriate or often should I check in? Are you supposed to keep talking to other breeders until things are set in stone? Thanks for any advice!   	dogs

822	[Discussion] Approaching a breeder/mentor	"I'm incredibly interested in getting involved in the Lagotto Romagnolo breed within the next few years. I've been told that the best way to get into a breed is to contact a breeder and, basically, find myself a mentor who will lead me into the world of my chosen breed.

I think this is a fantastic idea for me, especially considering that fact that I'm not an experienced dog owner (I got my first dog a year ago) and, with a rarer breed such as the Lagotto, it might not be the right choice for me even if I adore them as deeply as I do. Rather than potentially buying a pup or dog and realising I'd made a mistake, I would much rather dip my toes into the water, so to speak.

Not only do I want to get into the Lagotto breed, I also want to get into the showing scene too. I love watching dog shows and, no matter what breed my future dogs will be, I feel like I'll be involved in them no matter what. I'm eager to learn EVERYTHING.

I think I've found a potential Lagotto person who'll take me one or who'll direct me towards someone who would take me on and I've decided to send her an email at the end of the month. She's a small-time breeder who doesn't have litters too often but she's fairly known in the community for her three dogs which she shows and also has had some success in agility with, which is everything I want in my own Lagottos. From what I can tell, she also has some connections to some of the top Lagotto Kennels in my country who show in conformation more than she does. She's kind of perfect for me.

However, I'm a little stumped into what I should put into my email when I contact her. I feel like I have so many questions but I can't put them into words. How do I convey that I'm very serious about learning and finding someone who'll introduce me to the big wide dog world? Does anyone have any tips?"	dogs
823	[Help] How to retrain the way my dogs ask for attention?	"My one dog, 4 y.o. mixed breed male, will paw at us to get our attention. He's basically scratching, but slower and with more pressure. If we ignore him, he presses harder and becomes more insistent.

My other, 5 y.o. mixed breed female, adopted this trait from the other. So she does everything I described above *plus* her own brand of intense licking. She is always licking, always. It's her first reaction to anything and everything and I can not stand it. My husband encouraged it, but he won't be home for a few months so I have some time to hopefully quell this behavior.

I have no idea how to stop it. I feel bad in ignoring or negatively reinforcing the behavior because they're just asking for affection. It's not that I want to deny them the attention, but I hate the way they ask for it. Not sure what to do here.

I had three dogs (one chihuahua - girl, one bichon - boy and a mixed race one - boy) and they all got along together fine for years until the chihuahua died (giving birth) and then soon after these other two started fighting trying to kill each-other. I had to give the bichon away to a family that promised to love him and all but recently I went to visit him and he was in a really bad state, not taken care of, with fur never cut, all dirty and all and I immediately took him back. I washed him, cut his hair, and now he's all good and really happy to be back home but the other dog still remembered him and still tries to fight him (even tough it was about 2 and a half years they stayed apart).

826	[HELP] I’m dog sitting my friends dog and noticed she gets what looks like spasms in her back legs when she lies down. Any idea what this could be? Worried dog sitter	"When she lies down and starts to relax or fall asleep her back legs twitch, I feel so sorry for her she can’t seem to get comfortable or relax, she starts to doze off and the twitches wake her up.
She’s very active/hyper and doesn’t seem like like she has any pain preventing her from being her happy self however she does occasionally hold one of her back legs up for a step or two while she’s running, also if she’s coming down the stairs she holds the same leg up the entire time.
I haven’t tried to touch the leg or anything because I want her to be as comfortable as possible with me, I’m sure it’s hard enough for her being in a strange house and she seems to have taken a liking to me so I don’t want to scare or hurt her.
I’ve had dogs my whole life and I’ve never seen this before, this is my friends first dog and she’s very inexperienced, my thought is that while she may have noticed her doing this she probably thinks it’s just a quirk but I’m not so sure.
Could I be a trapped nerve maybe?

828	[Help] Does a possible vet misdiagnosis warrant reimbursement?	"Hi everyone,

My dog injured her nail while being boarded and was brought to my vet’s office, but was seen by a vet I’ve never met before. The vet claimed the nail wasn’t broken, only ground down (oddly, the only nail on that paw to have been “ground down”), and that’s why it was bleeding profusely. The nail was wrapped up and my dog was sent back to the boarding facility without pain meds or antibiotics.

Five days later, the boarder discovered that my dog’s injured nail was rotated. The vet was called again, said they didn’t have time to see her, and made an appointment for the following morning (17 hours later). So, the boarding facility took my dog to the emergency vet. The ER vet said her nail was likely broken from the initial incident, and had to remove the nail. My dog was then on crate rest for a week after, and her nail won’t grow back for a long time.

The vet (whose office my puppy has been going to since she was brought home), denied ever seeing my dog in the first place (later went back on this statement), denied the nail was broken when she was examined, and is refusing any reimbursement for the almost $400 ER vet bill. I don’t see how her nail couldn’t have been broken when she was initially seen, and my dog wouldn’t have had to go to the ER vet if her broken nail was initially treated. I feel reimbursement is appropriate. 

Has anyone here had an experience like this? I feel like there’s no possible way the broken nail was a separate incident from the “ground down” nail, especially since my dog’s paw was wrapped during that time and her activity was restricted. I know no one wants to admit to making a mistake, especially when it would cost their business money, but I have spent a great deal of money at this vet over the past year, and they’re adamant about not reimbursing anything from the emergency vet. To say I’m disappointed is a huge understatement. Does anyone have any advice?

I ran out and it looked like her leg was broken based on how she was sitting on the ground. I ran to her and went to comfort and she bit my hand, plenty of blood. I backed off to grab some towel for the blood and she drug herself to the house and laid in my roomates arms as i got dressed to take her to the hospital. She wasnt in pain anymore and stayed at the hospital till she could use the bathroom. It wasnt a broken leg and without an mri i may never know.

834	[HELP] behavior issue with my dog	"I’m brand new, joined so I could ask for help. If you know a better sub, please let me know. 

I have a rescue Pyrenees mix, and she’s always been a difficult dog. Typical pyr behavior, stubborn, has her own agenda, etc. it’s always felt like for every step forward in training, we take a step back. 

She had parvovirus as a puppy, and we adopted her shortly after she was given a clean bill of health. She hated being touched and petted, and it took us a good year and a half of teaching her that touch is good before we could pet her without her trying to bite or paw at us. Now she lets me rub her belly, so obviously she’s very trainable! She’s currently 4 years old, and I couldn’t imagine life without her...

So let me tell you what happened today. 

Walking my dog has always been a chore, and I’ve had to work hard to get her used to being in a park setting. I have an electronic collar (the kind that plays a tone if the dog does something bad), and sometimes she has to have it or she just won’t act right. I’m talking jumping up on people, pulling, growling at nothing and everything, chasing bicycles, skateboarders, what have you (I know she sounds like a terrible dog). 

Lately, the neighbors have been gathering at the community pool and cooking out all day on weekends. My dog loves this and only wants to walk around the community pool now, because the neighbors love her and pet her and love on her and spoil her, but I think it’s starting to be detrimental to her behavior because the last few times I’ve tried to take her to the park (big dogs need long walks, and the neighborhood is not big enough for her daily exercise), she’s been stubborn and tried to turn towards the pool. 

Today was no exception. She didn’t want to get in the car, was doing her typical Pyrenees stand on the sidewalk, not budging, turning towards the pool, all of that. I finally got her in the car and took her to the park. I went with my mom, and when we were halfway through the park, my mom decided we needed to head back because it was too hot (American southern state, it was 90f and HUMID). I reasoned that it would be the same distance if we kept on and did the whole route, but my mom seems to have a little Pyrenees in her too and pointed out that we would be more in the shade if we turned. Not really, but I had already argued with the dog, i was hot and tired, and fine, we’ll go back the way we came. 

My dog did not like this. She wanted to continue. I did too. Mom was adamant, so I got behind my dog and started playfully “herding” her along. 

As we’re doing this, a couple was coming towards us. 

Keep in mind, my dog has gotten used to everyone in the world loving her, so she sees these people, and even though she doesn’t know them, she expects some sort of love and acknowledgment from them. She jumps on the guy and he loses it. I’m apologizing, my mom is apologizing, but he kept saying, “wow, that’s just great. Wow, that’s real nice!” His wife was saying something similar, “oh that’s just nice, isn’t it? God, that’s SOOO nice!” 

My mom is a nice person, I’m not. She was like, “I really am sorry.” I couldn’t believe they were being so rude. I stupidly said something like, “I guess dogs know who good people are, huh?” Because I’m an idiot. The guy goes nuclear at this point, dropping F-bombs, accusing my dog of attacking him, trying to bite him, he chased after us and got my license plate I think (he had his phone) and said he was calling the cops. I told him to go ahead. 

So I went to the police station right away (it abuts the park) and made a statement. The officer told me he doubted the people would do anything about it, but I’m still worried they’ll try to sue me or something. So my mom and I are at the station, which is part of the park, and they saw my mom go out of the station because you pass it if you’re on the walking trail in the park (I’m sorry if this is confusing), and these jokers start taunting my 72-year-old mother saying, “you’re getting arrested! They’re gonna Arrest you!” I was talking with the officer inside and she came back in and told him what they said, she was almost crying. The officer thankfully rolled his eyes and said that some people have big mouths. He still doubted they’d do anything. 

I can’t calm down, though. I keep thinking I’ve done something wrong with my dog. Why is she like this? She kept trying to jump on the officer, too, because he didn’t talk to or acknowledge her. He was thankfully okay with it, and said she was just being protective. 

I’m not sure what more to do with my dog. It seems that I always need to have her electronic collar on her, no matter what now. I feel like I can’t take her back to the park anymore. I just feel so defeated. This doesn’t feel like a step back, more like a leap. 

Also, I’ve never seen her jump on people like that. When she was younger she’d try to jump on them, but I got her out of that habit. She doesn’t jump on our neighbors, they’re all great and kneel down to talk to her and pet her. The whole thing was just out of character, and yet not out of the realm of possibility for her. 

Thanks for reading. I think I’m going to cry in the shower now. "	dogs
835	[Help] dog repellent for edge of lawn	"I live on what would appear to be the most popular dog walking route on earth.

I cannot build a fence on my front yard due to town ordinances.

I'm searching for a solution. I've read about the ultrasonic ones but it seems kind of cruel, though I may resort to this. I have tried spraying chili powder, but I read that is not great because if they do go on it, they can rub it in their eyes etc.

What could I do? Most of the ""dog repellent"" sprays on Amazon have bad reviews.

She takes issue when I pat him on the head. I pat him firmly but not roughly. He smiles and leans up into the palm of my hand and begs for more when I stop. He will manipulate my hand back onto the top of his head in various ways. She seems to think I could injure him doing this. I have always done this with the dogs I've owned who enjoyed it. That is to say, the dogs who do this same behavior: leaning up and into the pats. I like to think I can read a dog's body language/behavior pretty well. He also enjoys noogies and she doesn't correct me for that. I couldn't find any clear answer to whether this might hurt him so here I am. Of course I don't want to hurt him.

Can anyone identify whether he’s a mutt/mix/or pure breed? My vet told me he might also be some kind of a Brazilian terrier mix. Thanks.

841	[HELP] Sub for Fromm Gold? My local store is no longer carrying	"title sums it up. I know many folks go round about high protein/no grain versus a balance, and the science behind it, but this stuff really does work for my pup. My local place is discontinuing their carrying, so I'd like to find a reasonable substitute with comparable ratios.

Kirkland? I'd prefer not to mail order.

[edit] My local place carries TotW, Iams, other usual suspects (murdoch's in the rocky mountain west). if i mail order, i'll probably end up staying with Fromm's or go to Candidae

842	[Breeds] Looking for recommendations for breeds that will suit!	"# Introduction

Hi all, we're considering getting a dog next year and doing our research into what breeds might be a good fit. Our dream dogs are huskies and we'd love to have one, but we're not sure they're a good fit for our situation - would love advice on that and suggestions for any other alternative breeds that might be a good alternative. Thank you for your help :)

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No - I used to have a Jack Russell, who was a bit of a handful due to lack of training and suitable care by his previous owner (they kept him inside a small flat 24/7 so he was scared of everything). He was wonderful with me, but could be anxious/overly protective and barked a lot at men and big dogs. I trained him as much as I could but I was young and inexperienced and I didn't know how to train him properly (nor did I have the money to take him to a trainer). Now that I am older and hopefully wiser, and in a much better financial situation, I am keen to make sure that we do the research and take the time to make sure that whatever dog we get is a good fit and well trained.

This will be my husband's first time owning a dog.

**2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/**[**http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**)?**

We would rather rescue if possible. We're leaning towards getting a dog that's 1-2 years old, rather than a very young puppy, due to not being able to be at home enough to look after a puppy.

**3)	Describe your ideal dog.**

A happy, playful dog that likes affection but is also willing to just chill sometimes. A dog we can take to social events and can be well behaved around other dogs &amp; children. Ideally fluffy, medium sized and wolfy looking :)

**4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

 Looks-wise, we like 'wolfy'-looking dogs most. We both absolutely love huskies and this would be our top choice, but I've done a ton of research and we're not sure if it'd be a good fit for our situation. I'm also a big fan of Shiba Inus but am worried about the aloofness! I also like the look of German Shepherds but the breed restriction issues put me off. We like labs and collie-type dogs as well, and we're not fans of small dogs like chihuahuas.

**5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Just basic commands - sit, stay, stop etc. If they like learning more commands or tricks then great, but not a requirement

# Care Commitments

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

During the week, a couple of hours a day. On the weekend, pretty much the whole day most of the time.

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

We'd be looking to get a dog walker (probably daily) for weekdays. I'd also be up for a short walk in the morning, and another longer one in the evening in the park, depending how much exercise is needed. We live opposite a (smallish) park (30 seconds away!), which has an unfenced dog area. On the weekends, we might do the odd hike or go to a bigger (fenced) dog park.

**8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Some brushing would be ok - few times a week. Willing to do grooming at home but may also pay a professional, depending how tricky it is.

# Personal Preferences

**9)	What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium - probably up to about 60 pounds. We'd consider something a bit smaller (30 pounds maybe) but we're not really into small dogs.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Some shedding is ok as long as it's manageable with a robot vacuum and a weekly house clean! Some barking is ok but we do live in an apartment block so it couldn't be excessive (the block is dog friendly, and we only have neighbors on one side and above - next door neighbor has a dog - but I think we'd get complaints if it was barking constantly). Would prefer  a minimal amount of slobber.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It would be more convenient to be able to but it's not a deal breaker.

# Dog Personality and Behavior

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

We'd like a dog that is affectionate and likes being petted - ideally one that'd sit near us when we're on the sofa, for example - but it doesn't need to be a lap dog!

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Slight preference for eager to please but not totally sure.

**14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

As long as it's not aggressive towards visitors, we don't mind.

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Chewing, excessive barking, aggression towards other people

# Lifestyle

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

On weekdays, we both are out from about 8 to 6. However, there is some flexibility - some days one of us can probably work from home some or all of the day. We will get a dog walker for days we are going to be out the whole day.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My husband has similar preferences to me, but is less dog obsessed than I am - but he likes them and is up for getting a dog. He's willing to share responsibilities but I think it's likely I'll do a bigger share of the 'work'.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

No. Maybe in future we'd get another dog but not until we were in a bigger place, with a yard.

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not regularly at the moment but we have friends with kids, and it's likely we'll have kids in a few years (i.e. within the dogs lifetime!)

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We rent and are allowed 1 dog, with no breed or size restrictions. We live in a fairly large 1 bed apartment. There is a small communal courtyard, but otherwise we do not have a yard. We will likely continue to rent for a few years, and then we'll either be buying or moving back to the UK where we're from (we own an apartment there).

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

we live in san francisco, california.   There seem to be some rules around pitbulls, and potentially insurance issues with some breeds.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It's moderate most of the time - average low in winter is 43f and the warmest days get to 80/90f

# Additional Information and Questions

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

We're really keen to make sure we make the right choice and get a dog that we can provide a good home for for life. We are willing (and expect to) take a dog to training classes and socialise it early on.  We will travel back to the UK 1-2 times a year - we have friends who may dogsit, or will take them to a kennel if not.

Thank you all for your help!"	dogs

846	[Help] My 7 month old golden is chewing on painted baseboards	"Hi all, 

My 7-month-old golden, Nala, got fixed about 10 days ago. She's having a really difficult time relaxing and chilling out while healing (it's been ROUGH keeping her calm, but we're doing okay). Last night, we finally let her sleep in our bedroom again and not in the crate. Well, I woke up around 6:30 to a very strange noise and looked over and Nala was chewing that painted wooden baseboards. Now this is at our new apartment so I am really scared my baby is going to get sick from this because it had paint on it! I am petrified, I could care less about the damage that it did to the wall but how much damage is it going to do to my girl?! Any insight? I sprayed them all with bitter apple spray and I turned on a movie with doggies in it so that's keeping her entertained for now (so cute) but I really am worried about her!"	dogs
847	"[RIP] Gertrude (""Gertie""), Chihuahua, ~3 years old..."	"[Good Girl](https://imgur.com/JfOYGUF)

I know this is long, but she was my first dog friend and I'm not even a dog person. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First, I think it's fair that you know I'm a cat person. I never had a dog as a child, I was attacked twice by large dogs as a child, and in general it's hard for me to get past that ""dog smell"". BUT that's what made Gertie so special. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In late 2015, we found her wandering some rural back roads freezing and starving. Even though I'd never had a dog friend before, I love animals and I certainly couldn't leave her out there. So we scooped her up, put her in the warm car, and drove around knocking on doors and trying to find her home. It was getting late and dark so we decided to take her home for the night and call shelters in the morning. I had a 4 month old at the time who was exclusively breastfed, so many nights we would sleep on the couch or in the rocking chair. This tiny little chihuahua just hopped up and snuggled right in with me on the couch. I'll never forget it - how happy she seemed to be warm. her big, bug eyes looking up at me whenever I got up. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the morning I called the county shelter. They said that where I found her was the next counties jurisdiction. So I called them. They said it was my counties responsibility. So I made flyers and went back to the road to see if anyone was missing her. She was so tiny - only about 2lb at the time. I called some other rescues, but no one had room or didn't want her. So the kids and I took her to the store and we got her a nice coat, some booties, and some toys. She wouldn't eat dog food, but seemed to like the cat food (our cat wasn't too big on the idea, however). My aunt is a vet so she said cat food would be ok if she wouldn't eat soft puppy/dog food. (She never did. She wouldn't even eat the special Chi mix). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 weeks go by and still no sign of her first home. We were already potty training her. The cat had finally warmed up to her (or given in...). Just wiggled her way into our hearts just like she did with the covers. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We were still calling her dog, so we though up some names. She made me think of that scene in 101 Dalmations about them watching the people walking their dogs on the sidewalk and how they looked like each other. I imagined she was owned by an ugly old woman with a nasty disposition and the name Gertrude just stuck. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now, Chihuahuas aren't exactly energetic dogs. She didn't quite understand fetch and didn't like to play for too long. Once around the block was enough for her. But Chi's are loyal and protective. She guarded our house and sidewalk and yard and garden and trees and fence...like nobody's business. So in April this year we moved. The new house had a fenced in back yard, but some of the fence was spaced out. So we put chicken wire around the bottom. She kept getting out and damnit it all if random people didn't bring her back home. We live a few doors down from a grocery store and she would frequently wander over and bark at people as they came out. If we were out working in the yard or the garage, we would let her out and she would stick by us. If we weren't out there she thought she owned the block. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The problem, is that we live on a busy one way. And my husband let her out this morning while he was working in the garage and he forgot she was out there. The kids and I were inside cleaning and I didn't even notice she was gone (she usually hid from the broom, but was the vacuums superior). I saw a police car out the window roll by, stop, back up. He got out. *that's weird. what's he doing* You couldn't see her or the ground because there was a bush in the way, but he stepped to the side *no...* and there was a thin, dark blue thing in his hand *no no no no* my heart sank like the Titanic. I knew. I ran out the door and I saw her tiny little 5lb body lying there. I didn't know what to do. She died all alone (though probably instantly). It looked as though someone had placed her on the grass between the sidewalk and curb. Who could do that and not see if anyone was around that loved her? 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My heart is absolutely broken. My 12 year old son is devastated. They were best buds. Top it all off it was his birthday party today. He cried when he went to bed as she slept with him almost every night. I usually stay up late doing homework or housework or work work and she would sit with me until she was ready for bed. I liked how little and cat like she was. She fit so perfectly in my lap. I really never thought I would take this so hard, but it's very quiet in the house right now and her little bed she never slept in (but humped violently) is empty. Her toys just sit there. Her little pink jacket with the fur around the collar is hanging on its hook with her pink leash with the little bow. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was a good girl. I really don't know what to do..... We buried her this morning in the family pet garden. I chose a nice spot under the zucchini plot. I think she'd approve. My grandma made her a little cross. My mother and brother came - she loved them so much and would go so excited whenever they came round. She was the perfect dog for this cat person and I'll never have another like her. 

And it's raining and she's in the cold ground getting all wet and she's alone ..."	dogs

850	[HELP] My dog suddenly has terrible smelling breath and won't stop licking his paws.	"My dog, Spike is a mix breed we rescued from a local shelter a year ago. We estimate Spike is 3 years old. He's supposedly yellow lab &amp; Australian Shepherd.

Yesterday I got home from work and I noticed his mouth was extremely smelly. Almost like Garbage! We went for a walk and I ended up rubbing his snout. I got his odor on my hand from his mouth and couldn't take it! It was like everything had this stink.

I noticed he was licking his front paws a lot when we got home, and the smell got so bad I had to stop eating dinner... Last night I woke up and he had licked his paws so much that our bed sheet had a huge wet spot and again the smell was awful.

We are planning to take him to the vet, to have a tooth cleaning done but we can't get in for a few days. Is there any recommendations. I have never brushed a dog's teeth but I was going to pick up some supplies after work today to attempt a good brushing. Any other suggestions?

851	[Help] Puppy possibly has intesusception	Hi there.  I have a 5 month old Tibetan Terrier who I have to take to the Emergency because she had thrown up all day.  We took her there and that vet said she possibly has an intesusception and we could have her put in hospital to be monitored and have surgery.  It was 3000-6000 for that.  We ended up deciding to take her home with medicine and to monitor her as the xrays they did still didn't confirm if it was intesusception or just gastroenteritis.  She has pooped a normal poop after we took her home, still has an appetite, is playful, but has since puked twice in the past two days.  I'm going to see our vet tomorrow, but I'm worried that I'm making the wrong decision by not taking her to the hospital to be monitored.  Shes not in pain at all as far as I can tell.

852	Adoption guilt and regret. [Discussion]	"After speaking with my SO and several other people who have gone through similar feelings, I’ve decided to post. Please read to the end before making judgements. 

My SO and I adopted a dog in late June. We had been discussing adding another animal to our family (we have a cat) and decided on which shelter to adopt from. We gathered all necessary supplies for the general breeds and sizes we were most interested in (toys, bowls, treats, etc.) and went looking at the shelter. We looked and interacted with almost every dog regardless of breed, size, and age. 

We both really connected with a dog that had only been at the shelter for a day. Texas has a law that all animals brought in as strays must be kept on a 3-day hold for observation and to give owners a chance to find their lost animals. The morning he was available we were there ready to adopt. We signed all the paperwork and were set to pick him up 2 days later (he needed neutering and his shots). 

I felt an extreme amount of guilt about adopting a dog that hadn’t been at the shelter for very long. I felt guilty that the dog we choose was a “desired breed” instead of a pit bull type dog. I felt wrong calling him a rescue dog when he hadn’t been at the shelter for longer than a week. 

The day we’re set to pick him up I get a call that his heart-worm test came back positive. We decided to adopt him anyway, despite what we thought would be a major financial set-back. We were lucky enough to find out the shelter partners with local vets to provide no-cost treatment to animals adopted from their facility. That was truly an unexpected blessing and something I’m incredibly grateful for. 

Once we got him home and took him to our vet of choice for a check up we found out he also had hookworms and a case of kennel cough. He also proved to be very hyper and energetic. 

Th first couple of weeks after we brought him home were hard. On top of the guilt I felt for not choosing an older, longer stay dog, I also felt like I didn’t adequately prepare myself for having a dog in my life. He was a lot of work and had a lot of energy I wasn’t fully prepared for. He didn’t have any training so he had accidents and didn’t know not to chew on things. I hate to admit it but there were days when I did feel regret about adopting him. 

After having him for a little over 2 months now, I can say all those feelings evaporated. He is the joy of my life. The work and effort we put into training him really paid off, and he flows well into our daily lives and routines. He is now hookworm free and starts treatment for his heart-worms next week. I don’t feel guilty about choosing him over other dogs at the shelter anymore. By simply adopting a dog, I opened another space at the shelter for a dog in need. At least two people have also adopted from that shelter because of how highly my SO and I speak about it. The reason I’m choosing to share this experience is because I was ashamed to admit I had these feelings. But, I think they’re completely normal because adding a living creature into your life who depends entirely on you is a major adjustment that takes time. If you also feel this after adopting, just stick through it and establish a routine. After a few weeks you’ll feel like you’ve always had the dog with you. 

TL;DR: I felt guilt about choosing my dog over any other at the shelter. I also had feelings of regret because of how drastically different daily life was. After a few weeks these feelings evaporated and I can’t imagine life without my dog.  "	dogs

854	[HELP] Advice on Nationwide dog insurance	"Hello there!

855	[Help] Taking in an unaltered, untrained dog	"Hi everyone! 

I have finally convinced an aquaintance of mine to let me take her dog off her hands. He is a 4 year old Chihuahua mix that has been to a vet once and is not neutered, so that is something that is going to get done as soon as I have him. He has spent the majority of his life contained to one room and has very seldom gone for a walk, so he has virtually no training whatsoever. 

I had dogs my entire childhood but the training and vet stuff was taken care of my parents - they were all fixed as soon as they safely could be and trained while they were puppies. I have two cats now and he will be my first dog in 5 years. I have no clue where to begin.

So I guess my questions are:

1. He sprays and howls, presumbly due to not being fixed. Are these behaviours that will stop once he's neutered, or is it harder to stop since he's older?

2. I don't even know where to start in terms of training. He is a smart dog but will it be harder since he's older? Would a training class (like the ones at PetSmart) be of any use here?

3. I adopted one of my cats at 10 years old, but she made herself right at home so there was no adjustment period needed for her. The dog is very anxious so I assume he will be nervous in a new home away from his owner and other animals. What can I do to make this transition as stress-free as possible for him?

Any other tips/advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!"	dogs

861	[help] dog vs cat	We’ve had our 8month old dog about 2 months. Had our cat about 5 years. Cat is not dog-savvy (won’t fight back, always runs) and turns out the dog has a high prey drive. The cat is getting a bit bolder about being around the dog, but still spends most of her time hiding or running. The dog is constantly fixated on the cat.  Looks for her, sniffs around her food area and litter box, stares while she is eating. We’ve been fairly successful so far in preventing chasing and getting her to “leave it”, but are starting to feel like this behavior isn’t ever going to be “trained out” or go away. When she starts to get fixated I try to distract her, get her focused on me, usually make her sit, or lie down, and sometimes do target practice and other small tricks like “paw” to get her attention, but sometimes it’s just impossible to even get her to look at me. I can’t even physically turn her head away she is so focused. What other methods can I use besides distraction to get her to leave the cat alone, or am I just dreaming that this will ever happen, and I’m going to have to keep them apart forever?	dogs

As much as I didn’t want to be in the room, I thought of all the terrible things I’d been through that she was there for, of all the heartbreaks she healed me through, of all the sicknesses she stayed by my side during, and decided there was no possible way I would let her go alone. 

So I stayed. I smiled, and I stroked her fur, and I told her what a good girl she was until I felt her body stop moving and the vet confirmed that was it. I lost it. I had to be dragged out of the vet hospital by my dad, sobbing and barely able to move. It was the worst feeling, the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

That being said... I wouldn’t have done it differently, but I wonder: do most people stay for this? If you did, why, if you didn’t, why not? "	dogs
866	[help] About to adopt a dog and I see some warning signs. Wondering if I’m viewing this in rose-tinted glasses or if I’m reading too much into it.	"I have been preapproved to bring home a puppy that I’ve fallen in love with. My parents foster dogs and in the past month I’ve gotten a job that allows me enough financial security to own my own dog. I went to meet this dog at their house and fell in love with her. The only step left is tomorrow she is meeting my roommate’s dog to see if they get along. However, there was an incident today that is making me question if I should go through with the adoption.

She is a 4 month old lab, pit, and Rottweiler mix. She was part of a litter of 12 that for the first 2 months of their lives, they were left outside to fend for themselves.

Today we had a lot of people over for Labor Day. She is fine with people, though a little shy. I was taking this opportunity to do some leash training and I was giving her treats pretty frequently to reinforce things I saw as positive, such as looking at me when I said her name, sitting or lying down, or following me when I walked away (before, she would flatten like a pancake when I put the leash on her). There were 2 other dogs that she had been perfectly fine with for the past few days that were walking and standing nearby. I was doing this for maybe 10 minutes when suddenly she snapped and lunged at one of the dogs. However we didn’t realize this is what had happened until a few minutes later when she did it again, because in that second we had all looked away at something else. So twice within 1 minute she growled and lunged at a dog. 

I put the treats away after that and she went back to normal. She was playing with the other dog just fine after that. 

I asked her previous foster if she has ever seen food aggression in her. She said once, she was eating in her crate and another puppy walked by and she growled at him. She said she never saw her show any aggression outside of the crate. 

I have fallen in love with this puppy and I would hate to back out on this adoption. Common sense is telling me that I should not take on a dog with an issue like this. Outside of this food aggression towards the other dogs, she is perfectly fine towards people and seems very easy to train. 

I guess my question is, how easy is this to manage, really? Could this aggression spread to toys or other possessions, and become aimed towards people as well? Do the pros of owning a food aggressive dog outweigh the cons? 

Bear in mind she is expected to mature at around 80 lbs. If I adopt her, I will enroll her in training classes. IF her aggression gets worse, her size could make her quite the handful. Or am I reading too much into these 3 instances?

like I said, I really really like her otherwise.

Any insight would be appreciated :) "	dogs
867	[help] My dog’s acting weird and not at the same time. Should I be concerned?	"My dog is an Australian Shepherd and border collie mix and is about a year a half old. My SO and I have had him for about 6 months now. He’s been relatively healthy aside from some illness he wasn’t treated for at the shelter (which was quickly taken care of with medication) and a hot spot a couple of months ago.

He used to love drinking water and would do anything for an ice cube and would drink his bowl of water as soon as it was set down. Lately he doesn’t care for ice cubes and he barely drinks his water but still goes for the puddles outside.

Over the past day or two he’s also been laying in more enclosed spaces. He doesn’t normally sleep or lay in his kennel on his own but the past few days we’ve found him hanging out in there. This is a little weird to us since he doesn’t normally like going in there. He also tried jumping behind a chair just to sit in the corner of the living room. 

There’s a recliner that’s near the corner of the room and the couch directly next to it so the only way he can get back there is jumping down from the arm of the couch or squeezing between the two. He used to go back there just to lay down and put his head under the back of the recliner but we decided we wanted to stop that so he wouldn’t get hurt in any way. He’s good about not going there but today he forced himself past me just to sit back there and pant.

This is the next thing: he’s panting more often now. It’s summer in the south so I can understand him being hot outside or panting because he’s excited about guests, but the apartment is cold and he’ll pant just sitting around. It’s one of those things where I can’t imagine why he’s worked up so it worries me.

My SO recently moved into the other bedroom in their apartment and someone else has moved into the new room (who the dog loves). Over the past week our dog has been laying outside the old bedroom more and I don’t know if it’s because he think it’s still his space, if he trying to sniff out the new roommate and his cat, or if it’s something else. 

He’s still playful, eating, and desiring just as much as attention as usual, but something feels a little bit off. I don’t know if we need to take him to the vet but I’m feeling like we should. He’s a little sleepier today than usual but I can’t tell if that’s something wrong with him or he’s just having a lazy day.

Are these things I should I worry about? I don’t know if I’m being overly concerned or there’s something we should really be looking into. Googling isn’t helpful since the answers are either “it’s just stress” or “they’re dying and it’s time to be sad.” Should I take my dog to the vet soon? Any help is greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Tonight we’ve noticed he’s been holding up a single paw sometimes when he sits. He’s switched paws a couple times too. He’s not limping, not pulling away or yelling in pain, and there’s nothing stuck. He did trip going up the concrete stairs earlier so he might have stubbed a nail or landed weird and hurt his paw a little. 

We are going to the vet as soon as possible to get him checked out.

EDIT 2: took him to an emergency clinic since we were worried. Doctor said there’s no physical issues she can find. She said it could be some anxiety since there’s a huge storm that’s rolling in this weekend and the barometric pressure is changing. "	dogs
868	[Breed] What breed is my corgi mixed with?	"When I first got my dog, Scout, I was told she was full corgi. However, now that she's over a year old and pretty much grown, I think she has got to be mixed with something else. Hell, everyone at the dog park says the same thing.

She has a lot of the corgi characteristics, like short legs, long body, no tail, and thick coat. She even sploots when she lays down, but I feel like her face is different then what I've seen.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/1P1sJLF) are some pictures of her I snapped. She doesn't like to sit still long enough for a picture usually, but if anyone wants a picture of her from a specific angle let me know and I can try. "	dogs
869	[DISCUSSION] What do I do about my dog and her lip problems	My dog is 9 years old and since around 8 months ago, she has developed scans around her mouth in the lip region. I think she got them after getting in a fight with a Pomeranian or after I gave her some chicken wing bones which she usually knaws on but that time she crunched them up sharply. Since then she has had the habit of scratching her lips to try and remove the scabs but she doesn’t realise that she is making it worse. A dog can’t remove a scab perfectly without it making it worse. She digs in deep and gets her lips all bloody and I then have to get a tissue to clean her up. She’s just making it worse for herself. I have tried negative reinforcement by giving her a small slap on the head every time she does it but I hate doing it and she doesn’t even care. I took her to the vet and they said to use a cream but it wouldn’t matter. The scabs would still be there and she would still make it bloody restarting the process. My only idea is for her to wear a mussle but I don’t want to put her through that. 	dogs
870	[Help] Need help with yeast infected puppy	" 

Hello everyone. We just recently got a 5-month old beagle who's been with us for a week. When we got him he had reddish skin and was itching all the time, so we took him to the vet last weekend and the vet told us he has yeast infection. We bought some medicine that the vet recommended but when I was reading online about this infection, I read that diet should also be adjusted to help him get fine quickly. Currently we feed him kibble from Holistic Recipe (that's what the prev owner told us to feed him) and I found out that kibble should be avoided to help him get rid of the yeast faster.

Can anyone who has had yeasty dogs provide some tips on what you fed and what you did to help him get cured? Really felt bad about his current condition since his hair is starting to get very thin."	dogs
871	When is it time to let go of your dog? [Help]	"Background: My fiancee and I adopted our dog from a shelter more than 6 months ago. The dog is a border collie mix, estimated to be 4 years old. The previous owner of the dog died leaving our dog and another. The dog was aggressive since we brought him. Whenever he doesn't like a touch from a human or another dog, he would snap and nip on the hand. We had a behaviorist coming home to see his behavior. The behaviorist said (after hours with him) that it is alright. The behaviorist added that nipping is the way to warn you that he doesn't like what you are doing. We live in a spacious 60 square meters appartment with no other pet. We take him out at least 2hrs per day. We walk with the dog out 4 times per day spread across the day. The time outside is split between playing scavenger hunt in the dog park (when the dog park is empty) and walks on a 5m long leashes so he can explore comfortably and safely. We try to make the time indoor as stimulating as we can. Keeping indoor time stimulating is really hard specially that our dog does not like any toy, we manage though with kongs and some kibble in a box with cloth tht he digs in for hours.
We spent the last six months of our time trying to avoid whatever annoys the dog. We used muzzle when we had to do something he doesn't like (nail clipping, vet visits). All fine until two days ago. I was combing the dog's hair (like we always do) and I believe I touched something that caused him pain. The problem is, this time he didn't nip or showed teeth. This time he full on went to bite my finger. I had to hold him by the neck to leave the finger. This is not the first time the dog bites me, it is just the first time he is so intent to hurt. My index was almost chopped.
I am not angry about that accident. I know that my dog loves me and that he trusts me. I am just afraid now of the future. There is no set of things he hate, some times he will turn crazy for no apparent reason. The dog does not intend harm, but he might hurt my fiancee (who leaves with me) or another dog or even worse.
We are cautious with him all the time. We never let children or small dogs approach him. I am just afraid of one time that something unexpected happens and the worst occur.
I love my dog. I am willing to take more bites (if it doesn't cause permanent damage). I am just wondering when to decide that the dog is a hazard or not safe. I am not angry or emotional in anyway. I just want to avoid serious injury for someone. I can't muzzle the poor animal all the time. I can't re-home the dog either since other people might not realize how aggressive he can become. When should an owner consider putting the dog to sleep?
TLDR; An adopted dog is aggressive even after many months of living in a safe environment. I am afraid of the dog causing serious damage to us or someone else. When should an owner consider putting the dog to sleep?"	dogs
872	[Help] How much companionship do Cavalier Spaniels need? Do they have to sleep in your bed?

He's alone in the house 6-7 hours so we spend the remaining 8 or so hours with him in the living room. Is that enough? I'm worried he'll start feeling lonely if we keep him off the bed too long?

I stop it when I see it, because I don't want our other dog getting an ear infection. But, she acts the same way about licking his ears as she does when I rough house with her.

878	[discussion] Adding a second dog to the family	"My fiancé and I have been discussing getting a second dog, but I keep backing out in the fear that our current dog won’t be happy. We have a 3 year old dog at the moment who is the most perfect, big baby. She is a 50 pound mutt that we adopted when she was 6 months old and we think she is a boxer/Rhodesian ridgeback mix. She is the sweetest and laziest dog ever at home. She sleeps all day, loves to cuddle, and loves being with her people. We have a dog park at our apartment and we have never had a problem with her and other dogs - she loves them all, ESPECIALLY small dogs. 

All of this gives me hope she’d be ok with adding a second dog to the family, but she’s just so spoiled I’m scared she’d get mad at us. She sleeps in bed with us, gets all the cuddles she wants, she even cries while we play with our hedgehog each night because she wants all our loving. 

Anyone have any personal experience or advise on whether we should go through with this or if it would be better to just stick with our current dog as an only child? 

EDIT: when we first adopted her we were living at my fiancé’s house where they have a dog. So she did live with a 6 year old dog for about her first 1.5 years with us before we moved out and she became an only dog. "	dogs

He immediately followed us, and we didn't even feed him. He followed us for a few days and he stayed by the pool in the night, and then we decided to feed him in a restaurant, because the owner of the apartments didn't want the responsibility over the dog. Another family came to the apartments next to us, and one of them was a vet. She said that one of his leg wasn't good and that it was broken before, and it didn't heal right. The operation to get it back would cost a lot of money, and he would suffer from it later. She also said that he is about 9 months old and a male, we don't know the breed, but he is castrated, because he has two  tiny cuts in his eat. We really wanted to take him back home, but we decided that that wasn't a good idea, since we have two cats and we live in Amsterdam, which is so much different than here. But we just couldn't leave him here, as he will probably die here, he was so hungry and tired. We love this dog. So we decided to find a solution, one day before we leave.

The vet put him on antibiotics and hydrocodone in case he has an infection, but she didn't seem confident that that was the cause. We have to wait for the xrays to be interpreted on Wednesday, but the vet mentioned the xray suggested it could be heart related.

896	[Breeds] SO and I are looking at getting our first dog. Looking to learn to make the right choice.	"Sorry in advance, it looks like I messed up the markdown/formatting.

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, our first.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would rather go through a breeder. We’ve checked local shelters, the dogs tend to be larger than we’re prepared for, and we’re not sure about the emotional issues they may carry.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* 15lb to 20lb, low to medium energy, non-shedding.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My SO is interested in Bichons because of their size. I am interested in labradoodles because I have met some who were smart, moderate in energy, and loving. EDIT: Forgot, she asked me to also include Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Shih Tzu on the list.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Apart from basics, we’d like to be able to let the dog run around without a leash and know that it’ll come back. I’d like to exercise like run or bike with it someday if the dog’s size allows it. We’re not picky.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* On weekdays, maybe 1.5 hours per day. More on weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Can exercise and playing with the dog be done simultaneously?

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* A local breeder suggested the labradoodle might need weekly care or less often, this wouldn’t be a problem for us.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 15lb to 20lb.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The least shedding possible. Barking, maybe not a lot, but some? Unsure about slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is a nice to have, but if we need to stick with a 20 foot leash, we’ll deal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A bit of both.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A local breeder suggested as first time owners that an eager-to-please dog will be easier for us to trian.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Any reaction is fine. It’d be nice if the dog could sit and wait for visitors before approaching. If it can’t, it is not a problem for us to control the dog’s environment so it cannot approach immediately.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* My SO and I both work full time. Her schedule is erratic and changes day to day, she might work regular business hours or might work later in the day. She occasionally works weekends. I have a more typical work schedule, with options to occasionally work from home. I can come home during lunch, although it would only be about an hour and half of that would be driving.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* We’re trying to figure out how to provide the time and attention to the dog. My schedule is more regular so for now we’re assuming I’d be setting more of the dog’s schedule. A schedule for me today might be waking up at 6:15am to eat breakfast and shower, leaving for work at 7:30am, leaving work around 5pm to head to the gym, and getting home around 6:30pm or 7pm. I’m trying to figure out what I can change to accommodate a dog. Wake up a little earlier and play fetch? Find some way to prep breakfast ahead of time so I can walk the dog and eat in the morning? Invest in a home gym so I can be home earlier in the evenings? I’m not sure how others have gotten by.

We’ve heard that mixed breeds may have a better chance of avoiding genetic health issues that pure breeds have, and we’ve also heard that smaller dogs may be at risk for certain heart disease, but we don’t know how true it is or if that should influence our breed selection or size selection, or not.

EDIT: I don't know depending on the breed or size if running with the dog or biking with the dog is possible once they are fully grown. Doing so is not a requirement, but would be nice."	dogs
897	[Help] Leash aggressive but okay at the dog park. F(2yrs) “Boxer/ American Staffordshire Mix”. (Looks to be pit mix?) Spayed.	"So my boyfriend adopted a dog that was around one, so now she’s two years old. He adopted her before we started dating, but I am now the primary walker (9.5x/10). She does pretty well at the dog park, but she prefers to sit by us rather than go play with other dogs. When she does play, though, she does seemingly well. I did notice a few warning barks whenever another dog tried to smell her private part. However, when I walk her on the leash, she is rather aggressive to other dogs. I’ve tried calming her down during the situation by reassuring her in a calm voice, which didn’t work for obvious reasons. I’ve also tried simply turning around and walking in the opposite direction which I then learned was incorrect. I’ve tried sitting there to let the dog pass. I’ve also tried walking diagonally away either forward or backward, but nothing seems to work. I would like to be able to walk her like I used to with literally every other dog I’ve owned, but this dog just feels exhausting and now I’m loathing every time I have to walk her. It is no longer enjoyable for me.  She’s this way even with my boyfriend walking her.  Is all lost? Is she just leash aggressive in general? 

If I’m doing something wrong, please let me know. The things I do have always worked on other dogs, but this one has me beaten down and exhausted."	dogs
898	[Breeds] What is my lab mix mixed with?	"Hi all!

I just picked up a 9 week old lab mix puppy. He is a medium sized puppy with a black and brown coat with white on his chest. The ears are long and floppy and the snout is connects to the head with a gradual slope, instead of a ridge. Is there any way I can tell if his characteristics are hound or doberman? Im a little worried since I live in an apartment and do not know how well I would be able to entertain the doberman energy level. 

Any help would be appreciated!"	dogs
899	[Help] SO moved in with cats. Looking for some integration tips.	"We've been living together for 2 months and we are definitely than a better spot than at first. 

Mac is a 90 lb bully breed mix (Am Staff and Boxer according to DNA testing). He's not getting excited anymore when they are separated by gates or if he's kenneled and they come in the room.

Today I tried a leash and harness on Mac and let the cats down on the first floor. Things were going fine for a while. Mac laid on the couch and the cats did their thing. Some curious nose boops were had and even a nuzzle from one of the cats. 

After a few hours Munch (one of the cats) got a little too curious about Mac which peaked his curiosity. She backed off and when he crawled over to her she ran, which trigged him to run. Thus was the end of our little experiment today. Munch went to hiss and growl mode after that. 

I'm not discouraged because that kind of behavior was happening even when separated so this had been good progress.

Anyway. What are some tips to follow for successful integration?"	dogs

901	Do any of you ever feel like some strangers can be over familiar with your dog ? [Discussion]	"I left my dog with my parents at an outdoor coffee shop when I went shopping and when I returned there was a woman laid on the floor with my dog stroking my dog who was laid on her back and she was talking to my dog telling her how beautiful she was.

My parents were cringing as it was supper uncomfortable and everyone was watching as it went on for quite a while perhaps 15 minutes soon as I turned up my dog came and sat in between my legs away from her. This isn't the first time it's happened it's happened a number of times and my dog is actually scared of one woman who lives near me as she grabs her head and bends over and presses hers again it and does baby talk to her for an equally awkward amount of time  and my dog physically backs away.

Do any of you come across people who go beyond the usual petting etc into the realms of really cringy and uncomfortable ?

903	[DISCUSSION] Labrador prefers to sleep next to my husband now that I am pregnant. Anyone else have a similar experience?	"I've had my 11 year old Labrador her whole life (and I've had my husband for 10 :). She loves us both very much but she is definitely more my dog. Since I've become pregnant (currently 38 weeks!) she has taken to sleeping on my husbands side of the bed. She sleeps on the floor as close to him as possible. She has a bed very close to this but usually prefers the floor next to him, almost under his side of the bed. 

I'm wondering if anyone else's dog has had a change in behavior similar to this when becoming pregnant. To be clear, it doesn't bother me- I just find it curious. She is just as affectionate to me during the day and always wants to be close to both of us when possible."	dogs
904	[Breeds] Owner-trained service dog breed?	"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* No, I have a sheltie and have trained her out of her reactivity. We've gotten our CGC and are about to get our CGCA. She doesn't have the size or drive necessary to be a suitable service dog, though. She's also lacking in the necessary confidence.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* 100% breeder, I want predictable genetics and temperament. How do you know how to find a service dog breeder? Do you just find a reputable breeder of whatever breed and the dogs should be suitable for service work? Most ""service dog"" breeders online I've seen look sketchy.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Non-aggressive, biddable, low/medium prey drive, high handler focus, friendly to strangers/other animals. Medium/large size (60-70 pounds?), I'm not interested in dogs that are aloof in any way, those that lack confidence, or those that may have any reactivity problems. I want a drivey dog but not one that is neurotic. I'm also not really into curly/wire hair, but I could probably deal with it if necessary.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* Goldens and labs for their reliability in service work. Also interested in flat coated retrievers since I had one as a kid. I also like English/Irish Setters or maybe spaniels?

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* Medical alert, tactile stimulation (DPT), body blocking, search the house for intruders, in addition to the obvious training necessary for service work (CGC, CGCA, public access training).

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* 24/7 as I am looking for a service dog

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* Maybe an hour of dedicated exercise in addition to what they would get going around with me all day. Absolutely no dog parks, I don't trust other owners.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* Yeah, I don't really mind any grooming. I have a sheltie, I do all the grooming on her. The only thing I'd be uncomfortable with is trimming hair like you would on poodles.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Medium to large, large enough that DPT would be effective, but not so large that they would be difficult to fit in places. Plus, extra large breeds don't live long enough that the training would be worth it, sadly.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Don't care about shedding. Barking and slobber should be kept to a minimum.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* Important, but can be worked on with training

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* I want a dog that will be by my side all the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\* Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* Friendly, preferably minimal barking, but that can be trained out. I want zero reactivity. No aggression or shyness whatsoever.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* Not at all.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* Shyness, reactivity, unfriendlyness with strangers/other animals/children. 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\* 

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* Not really ever 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* It would be my service dog so that doesn't really matter, BF doesn't care

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* Yes, dog (sheltie) and cat. Both are lazy af

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\*  Probably? Definitely has to be friendly towards them. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\* Yes, no ""dangerous"" breeds due to renters insurance, please.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* USA, no banned breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Summer high is 115, average around 90-95. Winter is around 50?

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\* 

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

 \* No additional information.  

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

906	[help] is my dog depressed?	"I've got a 18 month old lab border collie mix. He's never been a huge eater, but he eats roughly 3 cups a day ,only doing it when my GF and I are sitting on the couch. he used to spend time with us while I played video games. He gets a nightly half hour walk (which has always been more than enough for him) or we play fetch/wrestle in the basement.

Now, ever since my GF's sister visited us and left (~2 weeks ago) he rarely eats (maybe once every two days or so), barely plays in the basement and doesn't like to go for walks. Finally, this morning he coughed up some yellow bile. By this point he's lost a bit of weight and we're making a vet appointment this week.

I'm worried about him and wondering if there's anything we can do between now and the appointment.

We looked up yellow bile and everything suggested it was a lack of eating. He doesn't have diahrrea or mucus or anything else.

Anyone else have this happen? What did you do?

907	[Help] I dont know what to do anymore	"EDIT: Sorry for the long read, Ive posted this on /r/puppy101 as well
Hi guys,


I've been with my Bichon Frise puppy for 2.5 weeks now and I'm at my wits end. Right now I'm living alone because my parents and brother have been on holiday for a while and looking after this little guy has proven more difficult than I could have ever expected. I don't know what to do anymore so I'm venting here :/


Before I picked him up, I did so much research. Trust me, I spent day and night for months reading about raising puppies and Bichon breeds. Finally, I picked him up and since then my life has been consumed by constant overwhelming depression.


To be honest he's not a terrible puppy. I know the problem is with me but I can't help myself right now.


I can't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time which simply doesn't work because by the time I fall asleep, he's awake for a potty break again.


I really struggle to tire him out especially since he hasn't had his second vaccinations so I can't walk him in the park. I try to keep him on a schedule:


9:00 Breakfast and potty


9:30 - 11:00 Play tug, chase &amp; obedience training


11:00 - 13:00 Potty then nap


13:00 - 15:00 Potty then play with toys &amp; obedience training


15:00 - 17:00 Nap


17:30 Dinner and potty, no water from here onwards.


17:30 - 19:30 Nap


Until 22:00 I try to play with him to tire him out with potty breaks every hour and put him to bed at 22:00. Sometimes he literally just flops onto the floor and takes an hour nap before bed time (ruining my plan).
From then onwards he wakes up every 2-3 hours and I take him out then take him straight back to bed. This is where he starts whining and Im just begging for some sleep.


He relentlessly whines if I take one step out of my room. I can't wash my hands, eat, shower etc without him just freaking out. I've tried training him by going out of the room several times throughout the day when he's in his crate but he doesn't show any sign of improvement. I put several chew toys for him to stay busy in his crate but he just ignores them in there.


Im trying to get him used to his collar and leash but once again its proving difficult. He's fine with his collar but as soon as I put the leash on him he freaked out screaming. I didn't even pull him but he started pulling back and screaming. I tried luring him with treats but it didn't work he just put his whole body on the floor and refused to move.


He's shown great improvement in simple commands like, take it/leave it, come here, sit so this has made me feel less incompetent as an owner.


Guys I'm really struggling and I dont know where to turn anymore. I feel so incompetent and can't help but think this was the worst mistake I've ever made in my life. I have no time for myself, I cant sleep, I cant eat, I cant shower, I cant do anything. Do I give him away? Surely someone else out there can give him a better life than me. I feel like I'm losing my sanity! Please someone help me decide."	dogs

910	[BREEDS] Trying to find a good fit for a second dog, but getting more confused by the day	" 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* We currently have a 10 y/o rescue , who we got about 8 years ago. We dont know her specific mix,but we assume some kind of herding dog or spitz, as she looks kind of like a border Collie, but white. Before her I had a Saluki. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* In our country there really arent that many rescues, and breed specific ones are pretty hard to come by, so we are looking to get a puppy from a reputable breeder. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Pretty low key in the house, preferably low - but up to medium exercise.  My first dog, a Saluki, was awesome,but super aloof and not very cuddly. Would prefer a friendly dog who likes a few cuddles every once in a while. Preferably also a dog who is not too stubborn. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*  We've been looking into a few, but information varies and we're still very uncertain. We have been strongly considering a standard schnauzer, but after reading a few books on them I'm worried about their energy levels. The no shedding is a great plus, but not essential. Basset looked like a pretty good fit for a while, but the health problems seem way too overwhelming, and combined with the stubborness we're not so sure anymore. We have rarely had to deal with any sort of health problem (except old age) with the two dogs we've had, and i dont really want a dog prone to a lot of health risks. The Basset fauve de bretagne and griffon seem healthier, and look awesome - but I dont think their personalities and exercise needs would be as good a fit. Our main choice right now is the English Cocker Spaniel, but i see those too have some health issues. The more we seem to read about a specific breed the more sceptical we seem to get, so right now we just have no idea. We've taken a few breed selectors online, and a lot of them seem to be suggesting Old English Sheepdogs, but the amount of grooming seems pretty overwhelming to be honest. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just basic obedience

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours plus walks.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*  Our current dog and us go on walks totaling to about an hour each day. We also have a large fenced in yard (about 2 acres). 

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We will pay a professional if necessary.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Can handle some, as long as it is not excessive

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice, but its not super important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* We would like a fairly affectionate dog,but not one who constantly needs to be on your lap or have your attention.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Preferably one who is eager to please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* We can tolerate some barking, but would prefer a friendly, easy-going dog.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We already have a senior dog, so the ability to get a long with other dogs is very important. 

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Anxiety

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This will vary, as my husband works shifts. Sometimes he will have whole weeks of, and some times he will start work when i get home. Usually I'd say 8 hours max, or 4-5 hours. Our older dog would be home too. 

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My husband and i would share the responsibility. 

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have three chickens and a 10 year old mixed breed dog. Our dog is super easy going and friendly to all dogs. 

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Norway. The breeds who are banned here are not dogs we are considering. 

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 20-30 degrees (celsius) Winters - ranges from -15 to -5 degrees ( celsius ) on average, with some milder weather in between. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

*  Would prefer a medium sized breed, but we're open to other sizes as well, as long as they are not giants or super small. Our main issue with many of the smaller sizes is their look (neither of us like the look of the Havanese, cavalier, french bulldog etc) , which we realize shouldn't be super-important, but if there are some options out there for a breed with both the right look AND temper we would love to hear about them and we're hoping for some suggestions. Our top priority though is finding a chill, low key and affectionate dog with low to moderate exercise needs, and which will go well with our older dog (and not go berserk around our chickens).

913	[Help] Restless and doesn't seem sure what to do.	"My dog got spayed on Thursday. Since then she has been moving about a lot and just wanders in circles getting in and out of bed and then going all around the apartment and getting back in bed.

Eating seems fine, she drinks water. Bathroom is good too. But she seems to not be able to settle down. If she does, it's not for very long before she is back up wandering.

They gave us medication and we used it all as instructed and we thought it was that, but her last one (7:30 pm last night) should be out of her system now right?

I told the clinic the other day, but they didn't seem worried. This is my first dog that we went through the spay together (others had been spayed for a long time before we got them)  so I'm not sure if I should be worried.

She isn't crying or acting if she is in pain. She just seems lost? Unsure what to do with herself? Anyone go through anything similar who can give me any comfort or tips? Should I be worried?"	dogs
914	[Help] potty training.....?	So I have a male 2 yo dachshund (neutered) who I adopted a little over a year ago. When I first brought him home he would sometime have accidents in the house but I believe that was due to him being kept in a shelter where they were not able to potty train him. Since then, he has learned (somewhat) that he is expected potty outside. That being said, he never has any accidents in the house unless I have guests or other dogs over. He gets jealous and pees in spite almost every time someone is over. He will even do this when I go to my boyfriends for the weekend when he feels he isn’t getting enough attention. He will pee in his kennel sometimes which I find very strange. I am desperate for ways to make this behavior stop.  Any tips or advice is appreciated. 	dogs

Each time, he would call the dog (who would listen) and hide in his house as I bring my dog inside, making it so I can't confront him in that moment. I'm also concerned a distracted driver will speed through and hit their sweet dog."	dogs
920	[discussion] [help] false pregnancy in spayed dog?	"Hi all - another new baby and dog question. 

Our spaniel has been home for a good few days along with baby. They get on well and she's being well behaved. 

However she's been exhibiting a lot of behaviour that fits with a false pregnancy. Nursing and petting toys, being extra snuggly (she's always been cuddly but she's sort of extra cuddly) trying to make nests... When I'm breastfeeding baby boy she curls up next to us and looks totally blissed out (a bit like baby boy when getting boob). She's also been licking her nipples. 

Not sure if this is normal? She's definitely picking up all the new mum/ baby hormones. 

She's not really showing any anxiety. A bit of curiosity towards baby. 

Any ideas? She was spayed over a year ago (she's 2.5)."	dogs
921	[help] pit bull stomachache	I adopted a 2 year old pit bull from my local animal shelter about 2-3 weeks ago.

For the first few days she didn’t seem to have any issues with the new food, but this past week she has been having diarrhea and she threw up twice last night.

922	[News] 7 Ways to celebrate World Dog Day	" 

1. [Adopt a dog](https://www.ourdogbreeds.com/tips-for-before-buy-german-shepherd/) from the street or your local animal shelter (And inspire your friends to do the same instead of buying from a breeder)
2. Volunteer in a shelter whenever you can. (Support them with the old newspapers, clothes, food items and toys)
3. Get your neighborhood dogs sterilized and vaccinated (consult the local animal welfare NGO and municipal body on ABC – Animal Birth Control program.)
4. Try to help someone you know get rid of the fear of dogs. Offer them to walk your dog or play with him, dogs shouldn’t be feared. Given how great the dogs are, it is but too short a life to not discover these wonderful friends.
5. Walk up and say *Thanks* to that rickshaw puller, the army veteran, those little kids who care for roadside puppies and that old man you so often see feeding the stray dogs. Let them know that their efforts are appreciated.
6. Assist an ill or elderly neighbor by walking their dog.
7. Spend more time with dogs (yours or the ones you bump into)"	dogs
923	[help] taking care of a friend’s dog...did we spoil her?	"She’s been with us for a week. Our routine is I take her out for a morning walk before heading to work, and my mom is with her for the rest of the day until I get back. My mom refuses to feed her the dog pellets my friend gave us and spoils her with rich human foods like milk, eggs, and meat (I managed to convince her to stop feeding her sugary treats, but I can’t be sure she doesn’t while I’m away).

My concerns:

When the dog arrived at our house, her poop came out as a single solid piece, with what seemed like a healthy consistency. Her poop has gradually become small, dry, and harder to pass. 

Especially worrying is that she refuses her regular pellets now, and barely even drinks water anymore (I suspect because she knows milk is on offer).

I love this dog, but I’m eager for her to return to her conscientious owner so she can resume a healthy lifestyle. My question is...is there anyway I can facilitate her transition back to her pellets and save my friend the effort? "	dogs

928	[Help] How do I fix my dog's behaviour? Need serious help.	"Okay, so in March of year 2017, I made a really immature decision. Against the advice of my parents and a one or two classmates that I knew at the time, I got a puppy. I got him just because I wanted a dog. I underestimated the responsibilities assocsciated and all the troubles that I might face owning a dog for the first time. Things like whom to leave the dog with during vacations has been a great trouble.
The area we live in doesn't have many trainers to begin with and all those who I could find were just very cruel. Their solution to every problem was just using a stick or something to beat the dog.
So I stayed away from them and decided that I have no other option than to train the dog myself.
By the way, I was dumb enough to get a Dogo Argentino as my first dog. As the pup grew, I feel like the pup I got is a mix. 
As a male, he lacks a little height and isn't very muscular, he has brown and black spots and his face is broad but not as much as it should be.
So I used information from internet to train my Dogo mix.
I taught him some basic commands and he was alright in the beginning. But as I said, my parents were against the dog so they never took any effort to train him or look after him, it was all on me. As every puppy has a tendency to bite things in the house even after getting chew toys, he did destroy a lot of furniture and peed in the house. 
So instead of helping me train him against that, my parents left the dog in balcony every time that we had to leave him alone at the house, though I was against it, there was nothing I could do to convince them at the time. Walking this dog has always been a pain. So much pulling. I walked him most of the time but when I had classes or had to go somewhere that I couldn't avoid, my dad walked him and any amount of training that I gave the dog went to waste because he would let him pull and do whatever he wanted.
The street dogs and other pet dogs are a big problem during the walk. They bark at him and try to attack him for no reason and then my dog pulls on the leash more. If he sees the dogs that he's friends with, instead of walking with me to the dog calmly so I can let him play, he'll start pulling and jumping in the middle of the road.

During the time I've had this dog, I've gone out to see my friends very less because no one would care for this dog when I'm gone initially. My friends don't come over much because my dog jumps a lot. He never bites or acts aggressive towards any guest but he just jumps too much with excitement. These reasons have caused me to be very lonely.

With time I've convinced my parents to let him stay inside the house under the watch of our maid when nobody is at home and the dog just sleeps and acts fine most of the time. I've also taught the dog not to pee in the house.But those are the only things that I've had success with.

My dog never eats without the eat command but he has gotten food aggressive over time and I don't know what to do about it. Whenever anybody even tries to walk around his food bowls when his food is being prepared, he starts to growl and show his teeth. Sometimes he even jumps but never bites. This has made my family scared of him. It was so hard for me to get my parents to bond with the dog and now it's all ruined. The dog's behaviour was limited to food previously but now the growling and jumping occurs even randomly for no reason or if someone tries to play with the dog while he is sleeping.

This aggression, his hyperactivity in the house when we are around (he's calm when alone), so much pulling during walks, it's all made it impossible to handle him.

I walk him twice a day daily, sometimes I can't walk him in the morning but it's rare, usually it's 2 times a day. And that walking is just getting harder and harder. The dog is completely fine after a few hours of walk and then is completely energetic again and causing trouble in house. 
Paired with tje aggression it's impossible to handle him.

I'm at the end of my patience now and I don't know what to do, how do I fix his behaviour?
If it wasn't for me, the dog would on the streets by now because my parents are tired of him, my little brother who supported me is also with them now. It's just me stopping them.
We all love the dog but the behaviour is too much.
I've sacrificed my life outside school for my dog and it's just too much now.
I'll be going to college next year and I won't be here most of the time so thw dog's responsibility will be up to my family.
I know that this was rather long but please help me put with these issues. I love my dog and I don't want to let him go.
I just want him to be a normal pet."	dogs

936	Is this a worm? Corgi has non regenerative Anemia. [Help]	"Hi, 
My dog (corgi age 11)  two weeks ago was very weak. He was taken into emergency room given blood transfusion and spent the night there. He’s currently on atropica and prednisone for non regenerative anemia. His red blood count was 15% it is now 28%. They have done ultrasounds and numerous tests on him to rule out cancer, ticks etc.  

Last two days he started having a very minor nose bleed a few drops. 

He sneezed this out. It was one piece but I accidentally broke it in half when getting it from the floor.  Does it look like worm? It is brittle and maybe 3/4 of an inch long. 

https://imgur.com/a/1OVUzW1

I did take him to emergency room and was left with what looked like an intern who said they had never heard of a worm or anything that could be sneezed out like that and they asked their colleague who said they had not either. They did a quick red blood count test just to be sure his count was still ok but other that said nothing could be done. 

Just wanted an opinion to see if it could be something they weren’t aware of? It looks pretty worm like to me but obviously I’m a layman but they haven’t been able to figure out a reason for his anemia so I was hopeful it was this. I fully realize I might be just desperately hoping for a solution to his anemia. 

Thanks everyone!

942	[Help] Methods for determining if someone will be allergic to a dog in advance?	"My Mom is looking to get a dog. She's a near perfect fit for an owner (works at home, constantly going on walks already, extremely careful, able to give it a ton of attention, etc), with the one big issue being that she's always been allergic to dogs. 

Obviously, she is looking into hypoallergenic dog breeds that might help. But here's the issue, at least as relayed by her (I can't confirm if this is medically plausible, though she is a doctor so generally I take her at her word). Her allergies to dogs varies, depending certainly on the breed, but sometimes she even thinks depending on the dog itself (two separate questions I suppose). Certainly it helps in general to be hypoallergenic (she reacts much less), but it varies a lot depending on the dog, and an individual hypoallergenic dog might cause her just as much trouble as some other non-hypoallergenic dog, it just depends on the individual (obviously, I don't imagine this has thoroughly been tested, this is just her experience when visiting friends and family).

So my question is if there is some sort of method to test for allergies from a dog in advance. Is that a thing? I'd really hate for my Mom to get a hypoallergenic dog, and then find out she's reacting anyways, and have to find another home for it. That's just a poor outcome for everyone involved. Are there any common practices for determining if you'll be allergic to a dog in advance? 

I'm asking broadly for any sort of methods that are used. I mentioned breed vs individual dog above because I think these might be separate issues. I imagine testing for allergy to a certain breed is much more doable, and once that's confirmed she could just look to get that sort of dog. But she really does think that her allergies don't correlated perfectly to breed, and that sometimes she can be allergic to one dog and not another of the same breed,  in which case I was additionally curious if there was ever a way to test for allergies to a specific dog. Any advice or help is welcome."	dogs

I just want to thank everyone for all the advice and information! I thought a lot about how to approach the issue to make everyone happy and decided to see how night crating goes. I left her crate in the living room and she let out a little yelp every 5 or 10 minutes until falling asleep within 30 minutes or so. It was relatively painless. She didn't cry until 6 am when she was up for the day. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will be a good option until she can be trusted more because there are some things that I just can't block her access to in my bedroom at night. I also got her some rib bones, beef hooves and a couple more toys. She will be the perfect dog in no time flat with all the help I'm getting here! 


Hi everyone! 

I brought home a 1 year old golden retriever mix a couple of weeks ago. She has done pretty well... came out of her shell and loves to play, but she is chewing up EVERYTHING. 

Thus far, we have lost a pair of shoes, bluetooth headphones, a phone charger, a vase full of silk flowers, a bag of candy and the wood shutters on my French doors. Last night I caught her trying to chew the corner of my sectional couch. She has plenty of toys and bully sticks that she loves... but the minute I leave her sight, she is headed to cause destruction. 

Most of the items she chewed were retrieved from on top of a table. And if I catch her with something inappropriate in her mouth, she bolts out of sight and acts like it's a game. How do I fix this?

EDIT:
I guess I should clarify that she is crate trained (but doesn't sleep in it) and confined to the living and kitchen area. She is confined to my bedroom at night and everything is picked up, but she crawls under things to find cords or grabs things from higher places to chew. "	dogs

Medium-sized, with a compact / sturdy body. The coat is smooth, definitely not curly or wiry. Friendly, polite, cuddly; the type of dog that would happily follow you anywhere.

Primarily Corgis (either breed). They check almost every box on my list in terms of appearance &amp; size, and they are intelligent, trainable, and goofy.

Other breeds I like: Teckel, Beagle, Fox Terrier, Keeshond, Swedish Vallhund. I used to want to own Pugs &amp; Frenchies, but after doing my research, their health problems (and the moral dilemma that comes with them) wouldn’t let me. Chihuahuas seem interesting, too, but my SO doesn’t agree.

5)	*What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*

Basics &amp; more-useful-than-fun stuff first, but I’d like to teach him more complex tricks if he is eager / craves mental stimulation.

​

**Care Commitments**

6)   *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*

2-3 hours dedicated exclusively to him; more in puppyhood, on the weekends, and my schedule permits on that specific workday.

7)   *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*

At least one hour daily (on a weekday) of walking, playing with other dogs, fetch, and soccer. More on the weekends, and if the weather &amp; my schedule allow it.

8)   *How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

I don’t mind brushing him daily, cleaning his ears, trimming his nails, cleaning his teeth etc. I’d let a professional groomer take care of the haircuts, though.

​

**Personal Preferences**

9)	*What size dog are you looking for?*

Medium.

10)   *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

I’m ok with shedding if it’s manageable through daily brushing, diet, and vacuuming a lot. Barking can be a problem (because neighbors), but I’ll do my best to train him not to overdo it since puppyhood. I don’t mind slobber.

11)   *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Not very.

​

​

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12)  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

Snuggly.

13)  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?*

Both are ok.

14)  *How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?*

Any reaction is good as long as it is not hostile. Barking &amp; being suspicious are ok, but I don’t want an aggressive dog.

15)  *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

No.

16)  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?*

N/A.

​

**Lifestyle**

17)  *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

It varies a lot, but at worst, he’ll be alone for 7 hours; at best, someone (my SO usually) is home with him all day.

18)  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

My SO agrees me with me on the size &amp; temperament, but he wants a lower-maintenance dog (a couch-potato). He is slightly less tolerant of shedding &amp; barking than I am. I will be the primary caretaker, but my SO will walk, feed, &amp; play with the dog whenever I can’t.

19)  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?*

I plan on bringing a second puppy to the family, after the first is between 1-2 years old.

20)  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

No.

21)  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

The apartment we live has no breed restrictions AFAIK, as long as its size is reasonable (so no Great Danes probably).

22)  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

We live in Romania. I'm aware of banned / regulated breeds (Pitbulls, Brazilian Mastiffs etc.), but I have no interest in owning those.

23)  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

July: 22 °C / 72 °F &amp; January: -2 °C / 28 °F.

​

**Additional Information and Questions**

24)  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.*

I’m not planning on getting a dog very soon. I want to wait for 2-4 years until my life is a bit more stable (I'm 20 now) + I have a few free consecutive months to raise the puppy. Right now I’m just doing my research on breeds, breeders, and puppy training so I will be ready when that time comes.

25)  *Feel free to ask any questions below.*

As expected, my six month old houndish mix is very unreliable when it comes to recalling with heavy distractions around, whether it be people, dogs, other animals etc.

I know he knows what to do, as he has no issues with his commands in a normal environment, what can I do to boost his recalls effectiveness? 

I’m not really looking to off-leash him much, but my neighbors have a pair of boxers he absolutely loves to play with, and no (only invisible) fence. When he was younger he was super good about playing only in their yard, but recently when he gets up and excited he has been leaving their yard, and with a street there and possibly people walking past it could be very problematic. 

I’m cutting off his playtimes until I can work this out. 

I do work at doggie day care, and when he is with me I always try and work on recalls and placing. His recall in daycare has gotten much better, but still leaves much to be desired. 

I know he’s being stubborn, i just haven’t worked out what to do about it yet. 

Any and all help appreciated!

(also just wanted to pop in that yesterday he got barked at and he didn’t reactively freak out, so happy to see some of my work come to fruition!!!)

954	[Help] Yanked dog using leash?	I have a lab pup about 3 months old, and I was walking her earlier this night when we came across a toad.

I'm getting a harness for her tomorrow, but I didn't know the dangers of yanking/dragging her when walking until recently. I read online that yanking/dragging can cause dogs to have trachea or larynx damage. How do I tell if she's okay? She gets stubborn when I'm walking her, and sometimes she would lie down or sit down to resist the tug, and I thought she just didn't want to walk, so I would yank her up and drag her, not knowing it was hurting/choking her. I now am educated about this and will not do it in the future, but how can I tell if there's any damage from the past?	dogs

958	[HELP] New dog growls at old dog when he thinks old dog is going to invade his space	"We adopted a new male dog a week ago (1.5YO so not a puppy). Our first dog is a female. They are both generally very submissive and get along quite well. There have been a few growls as they adjust but nothing worrying.

The only scuffle we’re still dealing with is on our couches. We have two in the living room. My old dog does not think anything of bodily contact with me or the new dog, so she’ll lay down wherever. But if that happens to be right next to the new dog (whether she touches him or not), the new dog will do a sharp growl, jump up, and move to a new spot. This only seems to happen on the couches, where space is most limited (as opposed to floor or bed, and I don’t think my old dog attempts to lie as close to him in either of those places for the same reason - there’s just more space).

Do I need to take any action here, or just let him learn to trust my old dog?"	dogs

963	[Discussion] Buying a field-bred dog for companionship only	"Hi, 

I'm thinking about getting an English Springer Spaniel. I was originally looking more at Brittanys, but my understanding is that the English Springer Spaniels are a little bit less intense. I prefer the field-bred lines along several categories, like the fact that they have lighter coat, are less prone to ear infections, and have shorter ears. 

Since even dogs that hunt are companion dogs the \~9mo out of the year or so (i.e. when it's not hunting season), what are the key challenges to owning field-bred dogs as companion dogs only? I'm assuming they'll have genetically higher prey drives and higher exercise requirements. What are your opinions and insights? "	dogs

966	[Discussion][Fluff]Expectations	"So today I realized that with my training, and probably in other aspects of life, I expect myself to advance too much too fast, and that may be holding me back. In general when I train with my dog, Calvin, I expect him to learn 1 thing at a time, so training sessions are for just 1 learning task. Today I realized that with herding training I haven't been doing that. I've been working on something, and then expecting him and I to be able to continue to apply it once we get it down in that situation. He's great at holding to the fence in whatever direction he's moving, he's also great at doing a standing stop, and we are working on getting a lie down and turning. I've been expecting to go in with him and him to be able to do the first 2 things just like that, and work on the other 2 things at the same time as him doing those first 2. I didn't realize until today, when my training said ""hey lets just work on either turning, gate manners, or lie downs, we're putting too much on him"", that I was pushing him too hard. And I realized I do this in life as well. When I have to write a program or learn a skill and I've got the basics down, I then expect myself to be able to do everything without struggle and end up frustrating myself because, surprise surprise, I'm not going to be able to do it without more research or concentrating on each aspect, and if I don't realize that I'll never get better at those things. I think I will start to reevaluate how I go about working on things. I had always thought I was breaking them down into their smallest pieces, but I guess today I realized that those pieces all have their individual steps in them that I need to conquer first. As Calvin and I make more progress I will have to remember to not raise expectations too fast, otherwise I may frustrate myself and give up.

967	[HELP] should I get another dog?	"OK as a huge dog lover i want to get a second dog. The question is when. I want to get one like immediately, of course, but i'm trying to be objective and see whether i'm really ready. Please help in sharing your experiences and give me advice!

A bit about my current situation - I have a year-old male sterilized dog (cocker spaniel mix). He's the friendliest dog ever (he can play with any dog and not a barker at all) with high energy. I live in an apartment and work full time, but we spend a lot of time outdoor and he's mostly sleeping while i'm out. Never destroyed any furniture. He attended basic obedience and did OK. Honestly he's not the best mannered dog like you'd see in obedience competitions but he's alright. He doesn't have any separation anxiety. I take my current dog for various activities - running, swimming, etc, and train him daily.

The second dog I want to get is a female border collie. (I read generally the opposite sex dogs get along better) I know it's a high energy dog and may be challenging. But i'm an outdoor person and I plan to send my dogs for daycare once a week (right now i don't because my current dog doesn't need one)

So if I bring home another puppy now, the dogs will only be one year apart and they will age together. Is it better to have two dogs that are similar in ages or should I wait till my current dog is older?"	dogs
968	[Help] Dog suddenly doesn't want to go for walks at night	"We've had this dog for about a month. Up til 2 days ago, he wanted to take epic walks morning and night - 90 minutes at a time.

I fear part of it might be that he has bonded so strongly with me he doesn't want to go on walks without me. Is that a thing? Obviously that's unacceptable and he has to go out with my husband.

Could there be some other reason for a sudden change like that? He runs around our back yard just fine, so I don't think he's injured."	dogs

972	[Help] 10 year old chihuahua won't stop whining	Hi, I'm really hoping you guys can help me diagnose/fix the problem my dog has been having. My chihuahua will not stop whining/crying throughout the day. He is around 10-11 years old, not neutered, and well trained. I believe I have ruled out worms and fleas since he is not biting his tail or rear end, isn't scooting across the floor, isn't scratching himself, and I've checked his feces several times and don't see any worms or anything out of the ordinary. This problem started about 3-4 months ago and hasn't changed much since (if anything it has gotten slightly worse over time). I don't believe he is injured or in any pain since he doesn't show any signs of pain and the only thing he does when you pick him up is wag his tail and lick your face. He stays inside except for the few times a day when he is let outside for 5-10 minutes to urinate/defecate and to get some sunshine. His urinating/defecating habits haven't changed at all. I've tried researching this problem online and I've basically ruled out any of the problems the different articles list. I also don't believe this is any kind of mental problem since nothing seems to have changed. He is also trained fairly well. He sits and stays on command, and I've also recently trained him to stay when I put a small treat on his nose and he won't attempt to eat it until I tell him to. Does anyone have any ideas what the problem could be? He is driving me absolutely crazy... He whines from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to bed, only stopping when he decides to take his afternoon nap. Yelling at him and spanking him doesn't help at all. I've stopped spanking him since it isn't helping and I don't want to punish him for whatever problem he has since I don't believe it is his fault. I plan on taking him to the vet for a blood test in the next few days. Any advice on any other tests I should have done at the vet? Other than the constant whining the dog seems to be happy and normal. Thanks for your time.	dogs

974	[Discussion] [Help] Taking care of a street dog	"There's a park not far from where I live, and there are a few street dogs who live there. I go there with my dog mostly because she really likes them and they play well together. 

There's one in particular that she clicks with - they're a similar size, same breed, and I guess he's not so old. However, he is very skinny, has some ticks, a small wound on one of the back thigh - in general, he's a normal street dog. 

There's hundreds of street dogs just in my neighbourhood and I can't help them all, but I'm in contact with this one several times a week so I kinda feel a bit of a need to do something. I've started taking some kibble with me (he gets so excited at the sound of the bag rustling!) I was also thinking about deworming with Drontal Plus, and giving Advantix for the ticks. Is this a good choice?

The wound isn't huge or especially worrying from my perspective, but it is sleeping a bit of white liquid. Does anyone have any suggestions for care? Clorhexidine? 

Some other users of the park often see to the vaccination and spaying of the female dogs, so I'm planning on inquiring into whether anyone knows if he's been vaccinated. But is there anything else I'm missing? 

I am toying with taking him to the vet, but I'd like to try to manage the situation without that. Otherwise I'd need to trap him, transport him, board him at the vets, etc, which seems like quite a palava for both me and the dog.

975	[Breeds] Getting a second dog for my family	"I'm a 19 year old, still live with my family and go to a local college. This dog will be for my family and then come with me when I eventually move out. I understand the concerns of a college student getting a puppy but I have all my classes two days a week, work on my father's almond farm and so have flexible hours (we don't live on the property though) and I have the support of my parents who also will take care of the dog although it is still my responsibility. I know how much of a commitment it is.

**Introduction**

no preference

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Friendly, medium sized and not overly energetic, but not a total couch potato. VERY important that it is trainable and able to be off leash eventually because then I can take it to work at the farm like we did with my first dog. Don't want a brachycephalic dog.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

Ive looked into the spaniel breeds as they seem to more or less fit these criteria, also labs but my family prefers not to have a dog that big

General obedience and off leash training

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I can be flexible with exercise needs, but 2 hours on average would be about the maximum I could go. Walks/runs and dog park trips would be included 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Willing to brush regularly, haven't done grooming at home before really but I would be open to trying

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Medium sized, probably under 50 lbs but not super tiny. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

976	[help] Roaches + dogs: how the hell do i safely do this	"We live in an area of the country that just gets roaches this time of year, and we have an old house, so they get in. So far I tried putting a little bit of diemetacious earth around, which didn't seem to do much, and a bunch of thsoe black plastic traps, but somehow my little dog got ahold of one of them that I'd shoved under the fridge and chewed it up (she's fine! called poison control, she was fine.) But now I'm scared to do anything! 

I crate them at night so I could conceivably set something out in the kitchen  overnight, since that's when they're active. It just seems like every solution I see is pretty well negated by dog needs (don't have standing water, it attracts roaches! well they kiiinda need a water bowl) "	dogs
977	[help] my dog bit another dog today out of nowhere. how can I prevent this in the future?	"I was walking my two dogs today when I walked past a guy walking his small dog. we stopped to let them smell each other, as my dogs are super friendly and love meeting other pups. they were sniffing each other for a good minute, tail wags all around, when all of a sudden my dog Z decided to bite the other dog on the back of the neck. we immediately pulled them apart and I asked to make sure the other dog was okay, and he assured me that he was and hadn't broken the skin. 

but I was horrified (and embarassed.) Z has never acted aggressively to other dogs before, usually he gives a sniff and then ignores them completely. however he is very excited when it comes to squirrels and rabbits and usually wants to chase them, so I think maybe that's what happened and he acted as if the smaller dog was prey? except he was just happily sniffing him for a solid minute and not chasing him or anything else.

I've had him for a year now, he's pretty well trained on leash and with basic commands. he's so friendly and relaxed, any time I have small kids over he loves to lick their faces and run around with him. I'm just at a loss as to why he suddenly did this. was there body language I missed? he just seemed excited like we he meets any other dog.

for reference, Z is 7 years old, 70lbs, a major mutt but maybe with some great Pyrenees or amstaff In him, not sure. the smaller dog was maybe 20 pounds. do I just have to avoid dogs in the future? is there any way I can teach him not to do this?"	dogs
978	[Help] My boyfriend and I are getting our first dog , a rescue, what can we do to make him more comfortable? He has some special needs.	I should preface this by saying while this is technically our first dog, we both have plenty of experience pet sitting, raising puppies, and taking care of dogs with special needs such as anxiety. We also have a cat, Jiji who we love like our own daughter. The dog we are adopting is 1 year old, and came from a difficult past. He was rescued from a home in which he was neglected and abused, left in a kennel for most of the first 6 months of his life. We feel prepared to properly socialize him to new experiences, and he's great with other dogs and the rescue has assured us he's lived with cats with no problem. However, he has significant resource guarding issues regarding food and other dogs which we do not have experience with. He is otherwise a wonderful, mellow puppy. We've been told to feed him alone if he is around other dogs but doesn't have issues with people. Is there a good way to train him not to be as food aggressive with other dogs? I would love to hear some advice on positive reinforcement training with issues such as these. What's the best way to introduce him and our cat? I would also love some general advice on making a home transition as easy and comfortable as possible. Thanks!	dogs

Fast forward a few days and it looks infected possibly. I have attached a photo, she does not seem to be in pain. Is this a vet visit or is there an oral antiseptic I could apply to see if it clears up first. Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend!

981	[Discussion] my dog gets aggressive around bigger dogs, what can I do?	I have a 2 year old cockapoo male, who is a bit dominant. He gets along really well with smaller dogs, but with bigger dogs he will lunge at them and growl. I'm not sure how to get him to not act aggressively towards them. He's never bitten or done anything to another dog, but I really don't like this behavior. Once he does it he goes back to being friendly and wagging his tail, so it's not like he's super on guard once he sees a bigger dog	dogs
982	[Help] Too many preventative flea, tick and worm medicines to chose from! Concerned about overdose. What do you use?	"My Aussie is currently on Heartguard for heart worms and K9 Advantix II for ticks, mosquitos, and fleas. We MUST have tick prevention - that is non negotiable where I live and the tick collars don’t work well. 

I really want to get him on hookworm, ring worm and other worm prevention like what Trifexis does because it’s so hot where we are and there is stagnant water and mud everywhere. But we can’t use Trifexis because it also kills fleas and the vet said our dog could overdose on flea medication when combined with K9 Advantix. 

What types of prevention do you recommend? Any suggestions would be much appreciated! I don’t mind buying several types or just one but I really need it to cover ticks and worms, and my google search is becoming overwhelming...

984	[Help] Medium/long haired mixed breed; How should I trim/groom her?	"Warning: long post

Age: \~1.5 years

Location: USA, Georgia

Breed: According to Wisdom Panel, \~25% Chihuahua, \~12.5% Mini Poodle, \~12.5% Mini Schnauzer, and the other 50% is some mix of Sporting, Herding, and Hound groups.

Name: Diana

​

I know that some dog breeds are alright to trim, and for others it's an absolute no-no and can lead to heat stroke and sunburns. I have a feeling some parts can be trimmed, but other parts shouldn't. I've been tracking her fur growth to see what parts keep growing and what parts stay at their current length.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shedding:** Very mild. Running your fingers through her fur, you'll only get 1 or 2 hairs. When brushing, there's a small amount of fur on the brush, but only about the size of a quarter.

​

**Flanks/Sides of the body:** Short, soft, and dense. Literally feels like dryer lint.

​

**Front legs:** Paws are short but have little tuffs of fur sticking out from between the toes. The tan part feels more wirey, but the black part has that same soft, dryer-lint-esc feeling to it.

​

**Shoulders:** Kind of merge into the neck/chest fur. Not as soft as the other fur, but also doesn't continuously grow. Slightly curly/wavy.

​

**Back legs:** Similar to the front legs, but where the black fur is, it is much longer. It is still that fluffy, dryer-lint texture. Matts very easily. Seems to keep growing.

​

**Hips:** Soft, short fur like on the flank, but with some more hair-like fur on the edges (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing.

​

**Chest:** Fluffy, long, slightly curly. Kind of a cross between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint-esc fur. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Belly:** Very long (like 3 inches), thin hair (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing. Definitely more hair-like than the ""dryer lint"" fur.

​

**Back:** Curly ""faux hawk"" trailing from her neck to her tail. More of a loose curl. Not very dense. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Tail:** Long, thin hair like on the stomach. Seems to just keep growing with no sign of stopping. Strangely enough, doesn't get matted very easily despite being a good 4.5"" long.

​

**Neck/Shoulder blades area:** Similar texture to the fur along her back. Loose curls with a hair-like texture.

​

**Ears:** Similar texture to fur on parts of the chest. Kind of like a mix between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint fur. Soft, but not wirey. Seems to keep growing. Matts VERY easily. I have a miniature schnauzer and she has similar fur on her ears. Grows continuously.

(I tried to get good pictures of everything I want to talk about, but it's hard to keep her still long enough haha.)"	dogs
985	Why do some people get dogs they know are wrong for their lifestyle? [discussion]	"This may end up being more of a rant than an actual discussion. 

At this point I’m used to hearing people say they want a husky, shiba inu, or corgi even if they’re not a great idea for the person. 

Yesterday, I talked with acquaintance who took it one step further. This person, who has very limited dog experience, wants a Caucasian Shepherd. I was immediately confused. How come a person who doesn’t have any livestock, or any land, want a huge territorial dog? Because they look “cool”. I began trying to educate the person, talking about how much training would be needed and how the dog would not like the lifestyle this person would provide (small yard and not enough exercise). Everything I said, this guy said “I don’t care the dog is cool”. I eventually brought up the fact the dog would more than likely bite someone and he thought that was “cool”. I then brought up the fact the dog could, and most likely would, be put down if it happens more than once or if it happens to be a child. 

So what is with this kind of person? I find it absolutely mind boggling that someone could have this thought process. "	dogs
986	[Fluff] You know that moment when you come across someone in a hallway and neither of you know which way to go and you awkwardly keep trying sides until eventually one of you stays in one place while the other goes around? That but with dogs.	It’s so surreal when this happens with my dog and I love it. She’s like a little person. She just like lives here and does her own thing most of the day until she comes to me for cuddles or a walk. So when I come across her in the hallway sometimes this happens and we bump into each other and I usually end up being the one to go around her and she stops lol. But for a minute there we have a very human interaction of not knowing which way to go and not wanting to be in each other’s way. 	dogs

989	[Help] Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia	" Lolly, 5 year old Vizsla on Saturday morning 28/07/2018 started throwing up and having diarrhea, we took her to the vet, who ran tests as follows: x-ray with full anesthesia which showed enlarged spleen (possibly due to anesthesia according to the vet), air in the intestines; blood-work showing low platelets (possibly due to enlarged spleen according to the vet), and that it is not poison; cause of diarrhea / throwing up not established. According to the vet the condition was not critical, even though it was not clear what was wrong, it was advised by the vet to go home for the weekend and come back on Monday to repeat the tests. Later that day at home Lolly was coming down from anesthesia, sleeping/lying down a lot, throwing up, seemed dizzy, had diarrhea, was panting. On the next day seemed very tired, was sleeping/lying down, refusing to drink/eat, panting a lot. On Monday went back to the vet to repeat the tests, x-ray showed less air in the bowels, thick bowel walls, blood-work showed dangerously low platelets. Further the vet established that diarrhea and throw up had blood in it (it was black, so we did not pick up on it on our own, now we know). Lolly was put on a drip and kept at the clinic for further tests. She was put on antibiotics and steroids (Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day). Platelets count went up, overall condition improved, on Wednesday she started eating on her own, on Thursday she went number 2 for the first time since Monday and there was no blood in it, so she was released home with the following prescription: Controloc Pantoprazole 40 mg per day (not to throw up other pills), after that in 30 minutes steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 35 mg per day and Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day. On Thursday 09/08/2018 steroids Corotrope Prednisolone were reduced to 25 mg per day. On 25/08/2018 a drop in red blood cells was diagnosed. New prescription was Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Course of  Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day was completed and no longer required. A week after that, today on 01/09/2018 a diagnosis of Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia was given, a course of  Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Hepatiale Forte 1 tablet per day (in order to protect liver) was prescribed, new appointment at the vet was set 1 month from now. During the appointment ultrasound was performed, enlarged liver was diagnosed (which is also visible, abdomen is enlarged) and impact to the liver was detected due to the steroids.  

At the moment Lolly seems to be not critical, but a bit tired, not very active (she used to play and run around a lot, she doesn't now), panting a lot, walking only for 10 minutes and rushing back home to the air-con, she has very good appetite, drinks a lot of water. Visibly enlarged liver gives us a great concern.

We requested all our data to be emailed to us, once it is done we will be seeking a second opinion, even though we do not have any complaints, our vet seems to be professional and caring (but what do we know?), we just need to be sure that whatever we are doing is right, nothing is overlooked, the diagnosis is correct, etc. Also, we currently live abroad in a small country with not many good  options regarding veterinary care (knowledge and equipment might be also outdated).

Therefor we are asking for any information helpful in this matter, please help! Anybody has any experience / knowledge in this area? What to do? What not to do? How to avoid further damage to liver and possibility of Cushing's Disease? Anything we need to read/know? Any online resources/communities which can help us?

Our Lolly is a very beautiful and precious doggy; she is a rescue, who was found at 2 months old almost starved and with a broken leg, life was not kind to her, but she is a fighter and our very special princess. Please help us make sure that she lives a long and happy life!"	dogs
990	[Help] Dogs penis leaking uncontrollably	"So my big boy 160lbs Bandit ate a whole salami roll yesterday by accident. I came home with groceries and as I emptied the bags on the counter he must have grabbed it (there is a reason why his name is bandit) without me noticing. I found the wrapper 10 minutes later on the livingroom floor and one happy looking dog. He was absolutely fine for 6hrs until bed time when I woke up in a puddle next to my head. A salami smelling puddle, I was very confused and thought bandit had thrown up but it was clear and just smelled like salami. As I'm walking over to bandit ro make sure hes ok i see him sleeping on his side and clear liquid (i asume pee) dribbling out of his penis onto him and the floor, he noticed 2 seconds later and started licking himself. I let him out and he went for a good long pee. After I let him back in, I change the bed sheets and notice him doing it again. I let him out and he goes pee again for a long time ( I watched him to see if he had to pee). This happened 5 times in the middle of the night over and over again. He would dribble a little as hes relaxed inside and would full on pee a minute long later outside. 

I'm thinking he drank to much water from the salty salami, but I've never seen him full on pee 15 minutes after he just went. His poo looks normal and he is behaving fine too.   Is this going to pass on it's own or do you think he needs to see someone right away?

991	[Help] Husky Mix is terrified of fireworks	"So, last night my wonderful neighbors blew off some pretty LOUD fireworks. to put in to perspective, it sounded like dynamite. to make matters worse, my dogs including my Husky was in the yard at the time. My other 2 were shaken but seem okay. but my husky seems to have taken the brunt of the nervousness. 

I proceeded to allow him back inside. waited a bit and brought him outside on the leash. He was shaking violently. I brought him into the yard with a leash and my other dogs. No luck. still terrified. When my boyfriend got home, we took them for a walk together. and he did use the bathroom. 

After bringing him in, he ran to my bedroom and proceeded to have diarrhea on my bed. 

This morning he did eat. but he wouldn’t leave my bedroom and he wouldn’t go outside. at all. 

I decided to remove all of them from my house and bring him to my moms. partially cause my mom has an overly confident Lab. 

So far, he’s still shaking. He still won’t go outside. and he still isn’t willing to play.   

I don’t know what to do. Should i take him to the vet? I’m at a loss here. i know fireworks can cause fear in a dog but he’s so scared. and it’s literally breaking my heart. "	dogs
992	[Breeds] I don't know a lot about caring for dogs, so want to see if my expectations and preferences are realistic.	"Not to long ago I started saving money so I can get a dog when I move to my own place In a few years, but was told (by people how know nothing about dogs just like me) that the kind of dogs I want would be unfit for the living conditions I'll probably have. There's nothing I want more then to get a dog, but if I need to wait 10 years until I have a bigger house then that's what I'll do. 

**Introduction**

 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs

 * yes.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

 * I would love to a rescue.

 3) Describe your ideal dog. 

* I mostly like medium to large dogs, with a medium coat (I think. Examples are golden retriever, German shepherd, border collie, Australian shepherd) . This is based on looks alone, since other than golden retrievers being friendly I don't know the personalities of dogs, and I feel that most websites don't do a good job describing them. 

 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

* pretty much listed adove. Also husky, but since I live in the middle east Im worried it'll be too hot for it. 

 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

 * probably not more than the basics at first. 


**Care Commitments**

 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* around 3-4 hours I think, but Ill be home with him longer than that.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* Im assuming I'll take it for a walk twice a day, and if its a breed that need more exorcise Ill find someone to walk it a third time when Im not home. And yes we will go to the dog park (as longs is it like to be around other dogs of course).

 8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* as much as brushing as needed. I am open to doinf these things at home, but I think I migth mess it up, especially trimming, so Ill probably pay someone/get a more experienced friend to help me. 


**Personal Preferences**

 9) What size dog are you looking for?

 * as I said earlier fairly large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * shedding is ok, just as long as its fairy easy to clean (does that even change between breeds?). Barking in general is also fine with me, just need to be able to train it to not bark at guests. Slobber I cant handle. 

 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

* I'd like that very much, but its not crucial.


**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

* snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * both I guess? I do need SOME alone time (not in a different room or something, just no playing with it) but I don't want to have to beg for its attention like with a cat. 

 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Its very Important to me that It will be (or can be easly trained to be) clam when visitors arrive and not jump on them. A good friend of mine is very uncomfortable with that and I don't want to be afraid to come to my apartment. 

 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

 * yes, but I feel that it's not a good idea since I'm new to dogs.

 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * I dont think so. Just not jumping on visitors. 


**Lifestyle** 

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

* In a week day probably a few hours. Ill try to use walkers and day cares as much as I can. On the weekend I'll mostly be home all day. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* um.. I cantnreally know right now. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

 * no

 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

* nope

 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* I will rent, but obviously I dont know any of this stuff yet. Lets assume ther are no restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 * No laws like that as far as I know. From Israel.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* hot. Summer is usually 25-30 C°, but very moist (70-80%) so feels like 30-35 C° (all according to our weather website). 


Maybe Im delusional, maybe theres a breed exactly like I want.  I have no idea. Sorry for any English/ terminology or any other mistakes. 

Thanks in advance!"	dogs

She also wrestles with our older dog, but the older dog is 5 and has bad hips so wrestle mania doesnt always last very long.

996	[Update] 3y.o. dog’s sudden fear of going outside has progressed to him eliminating indoors.	"Howdy dog-lovers!

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/9b4n3h/discussion_just_moved_from_tx_to_pa_dog_ive_had/?st=JLJIQQWZ&amp;sh=2f0d0d9a

First and foremost, we HAVE scheduled a vet appointment. I was hoping this was a fluke but now that it’s been a minute he is going to be checked out by a veterinarian for any possible medical causes. Could use some support in the meantime however.

I have also switched from calling Samson’s problem “anxiety” to “fear” because I feel like that is closer to the truth. He doesn’t bark or chew things up or anything of the sort, he just tucks his tail and cowers.

Some background I didn’t give in the last post: Samson is a pit rescue from a kill shelter that was at full capacity when I adopted him. He was so fearful of everyone and everything that I was surprised they categorized him as adoptable and had to leave with him that day before they re-considered. This has never manifested through aggression, only through the cowering/tucking I mentioned above.

The shelter was unable to give us any information on him but I do believe he was an owner surrender in large part because he was already potty trained. Our very first adventure was de-sensitizing him to the presence of humans, and then dogs, and he never once eliminated indoors.

It was about two years later that we moved across the country and I cannot stress enough that he was exhibiting no signs of fear whatsoever at that point. I, and the people around him, considered him socialized and rehabilitated.

His first three weeks went even better than I anticipated. He didn’t like the busy streets and I didn’t push him on that. We walked along the residential ones and through a nearby retirement community. He loved meeting new people and smelling new smells... until this past week he suddenly just didn’t.

Someone asked in the last post whether I had a little patch of yard for elimination and I do! Initially when he was showing resistance towards going on long walks out through the back of our building I tried taking him out to the front, which I have avoided because the street is busier, and that worked. During this time we were doing some re-conditioning with treats and he seemed very amenable to the process.

One night I went out for three hours, got home around midnight. He whined to go out so I took him out front and he urinates. He whined when we got back so I took him out again and he did nothing before hitting his fear threshold and cowering before the door. My initial thought was that I had misjudged what he wanted so we went back in and he continued whining. I tried a few other things and eventually the whining stopped but when I woke up in the morning he had defecated indoors.

Because I was not the one to potty train him I know nothing for certain but can only judge by his reactions that it didn’t go well. The first thing I noticed when I woke up was that he wasn’t sleeping with me. He was in his crate and I couldn’t get him to come out.

The next day I took him out (w treats of course), he urinated, then came back in and defecated within thirty min. I did not punish him because I know he doesn’t respond to that sort of thing.

Last night I loaded up on more treats and cheap toys that he loves to tear up for more positive reinforcement. Again I took him out, he urinated, but I woke up to him having urinated and defeated in the apartment. At the very least he is reacting less shamefully to eliminating indoors, which I am happy about.

When we are inside and he hasn’t had a recent accident he is the exact same happy, silly dog that I know and love.  But as soon as I grab the leash it’s all far. I hoped it was a bad smell emanating from an overflowing dumpster but despite an initial improvement upon it being emptied this doesn’t seem to be the case.

Initially I was resistant to potty pads as it felt a bit like de-potty training him but do you think this would be a good idea? Any advice at all would be appreciated, I am not at a point in my life where I expected to be potty training a dog so I am not as familiar with this process as I would like to be. Please keep us in your thoughts."	dogs

I run mostly on pavment but sometimes trails. I live in Arizona and it can get up to 120 degrees in the summer. but I run in either the late evening or early mornings so ground temp shouldn't be a problem for paws.

Other than a running partner I'm mostly looking for a companion that I can hang out and cuddle on my couch with.

I work and shift job, right now I work 4-12am shift. So I have to be able to leave the dog at home for 8hrs. Sometimes I have to work 16hr shifts but usually only once a week. There are walking services in my area I can use during work and if i have to work overtime.

I don't care about shedding or anything I live alone so it won't annoy anyone else either.

999	[HELP] Is it too soon for us to get another dog?	"Earlier this week someone cut the chain on our gate and I can only assume stole our beautiful boy, Finn. There hasn’t even been a sighting of him and I can’t see anyone going through the effort to break a chain just to be an asshole and let him out. I am absolutely devastated. He is always in his crate when we leave the house but I was running late to pick my son up from school (the street behind us) so I left him outside because he was happily laying in the sun chewing on a bone. I was literally only gone for 10 minutes. I have a dog sized hole in my heart and I hope nobody has taken him for fighting. He is the biggest sook and he’s such a mummy’s boy. He’s familiar with the area from our walks so if he was wandering around I feel like he would have come home. 

A few weeks ago we decided that in the near future we wanted to get a miniature dachshund. But now that Finn is gone I’m heartbroken and i just don’t know if it’s too soon.

One of the shelter's requirements is that I have to spay her. I had  no problem with it, but recently I've read that female dogs can get more agressive and territorial after spaying and I kind of hate that idea. She's a small dog and likes most dogs in my neighbourhood. Being agressive could also be a threat to her, since most dogs around here are bigger than her.

I've only had male dogs up until now and any change in behavior after neutering was usually for the better - they would get more friendly towards other male dogs etc.

So right now I am getting seriously concerned about all this spaying business. I have to spay her anyway, but I wanted to ask if I have a reason to be worried or is agression in spayed dogs actually not that common?"	dogs
1003	[help]. My beagle s having strange seizures but can be ‘snapped’ out of it if I call his name	"My Beagle; Patch a cross King Charles is 12yrs and over the past 12 months has been having intermittent seizures where his head would start to wobble, be glassy eyed and appear not with it but has been getting worse to the point if left alone, he would loose the ability to stay sitting up and his legs would go out from under him.   Nothing else happens to him
But I can call his name with a sharp voice and he seems to respond and ‘snap’ out of it and go back to normal. 
Happening everyday now and the intensity is getting stronger to him, because i can still call his name and he stops the episode.

1010	[Breeds] Researching which sort of dog to get!	"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* My husband and I both grew up with family dogs but we havent had any as adults. My mother bred Pugs and spaniels so I have a reasonable exposure to training etc (but again, not for quite afew years!) My husbands parents picked up some random 'pet shop special' mixtures - both of which turned into quite large boisterous dogs so hes concerned about this  

*  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \*  My husband would very much prefer getting a purebred so we know the dogs (likely) temperament etc (after his parents experiences..)
*  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Affectionate and cuddly as well as independant enough to not destroy the house if left afew hours. Active enough to enjoy playing with the children/going for long walks but not requiring hours and hours of exercise.
* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* Japanese Spitz - They seem a good mix, friendly and affectionate as well as easily trainable, their easy-care coat is a big plus too. A good companion from what I can tell. Schnausers - They also seem friendly and a good family pet (my husband likes their look!) But very open to suggestions!
*   5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The basics - sit, lay down, heel, wait, roll over etc? \*\*Care Commitments\*\*   
*  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* I'm a at home mostly most days so would be around for companionship the majority of the time.   
*  7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \*  I go for a walk most days but could easily do 2 most days. (probably 90 mins total-ish) The children would play with the dog alot too but I wouldnt want to count on this as exercise.  
* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I would prefer a reasonably easy-care dog. Brushing afew times a week would be fine, maybe a proper groom afew times a year but not much more than that.
*   \*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 
*  9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Small to medium (I dont want too small, husband doesnt want too big :P)  10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* As little as possible of all 3  
* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Not terribly important, it would be nice to not have to worry about but also isnt a deal breaker at all.  
* \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Snuggly for sure, lots of affection!  
* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* Eager to please - But also would prefer one that isnt too likely to get anxious if let alone on occasion.   
* 14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Having abit of a bark would be fine but I dont want to have to worry about the dog biting or anything like that. A doorbell as opposed to an alarm system..  
* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No  
* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Aggressiveness towards anything.   \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
* 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* More days than not It could be around me - either at home or come with me to school pickups etc, on days it is left alone probably around 3-4 hours at a time.  
* 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* The children are excited for pretty much anything, theyll have jobs like feeding (although obv if they forget itll be one me), my husband is keen for a pretty easy-care dog (he travels alot so most of the day to day will be on me though)  
* 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* We have some tropical fish and 2 cats. One of the cats is a 12 year old birman and the other is a 2 year old Ragdoll - Shes pretty playful and will love having a buddy - her best friend for awhile was the neighbors freerange bunny..

1011	[help] Fetch on a long leash?	"There are several parks in my area that I'd love to play in with my 5 year old female chocolate lab named Coco. But none of them are closed off. So I was thinking keeping her leashed to me on a long lead would allow me to get her out and playing and keep her as safe as possible.

1012	[Help] Punch Biopsy Kwik powder instead of stitches??	"I went to go see a vet since I felt a lump in my dogs side. I think it was a punch Biopsy that was done but he said he put some kwik while it healed.

Obviously my dog licks his wounds and this is what it looks like.

https://imgur.com/a/y72A7A8

Surely it's not suppose to be exposed like this right?? I read online that normally they'll stich it up, leaving it exposed like this would probably get infected.

He said he looked at it under a microscope and the lump is benign.

Still, throwing kwik stop powder seems a bit half assed.

I'm gonna drop by tomorrow to pick up my dogs medical records and find a different vet that can stitch up my dog

btw this is on the inside of his upper thigh

1013	[Vent] I'm SO tired of people getting dogs when they aren't prepared for one	"So let me just explain this a little more. I have heard so many stories lately of people getting dogs and then complaining when the dog...is a dog. Or the most frustrating, when a puppy is acting like a puppy. 

For example: A woman I'm in a Facebook group with is freaking out because her 17 week old puppy ""pushed over"" her young daughter. Well, a puppy isn't going to purposely push over a child. She's worried about her daughter being hurt. Well, if you were worried about that, then you should've gotten an older, well-trained dog or waited until your daughter was older to get a puppy. 

I get so upset with these situations because these dogs most likely end up getting re-homed, because they couldn't handle it. A dog, and especially a puppy, is hard work...it's basically like caring for a baby. They need attention and if you can't do that, DON'T GET ONE. Ugh. People treat dogs and puppies like toys and it makes my heart hurt so much honestly.

1014	[Discussion] Are we prepared? + BONUS: dealing with staunch #ADOPTDON'TSHOP people	"EDIT: first time poster and just realised this should be a help tag 

Hey Reddit! Sorry for the essay. My partner (21M) and I (20F) are planning on getting a puppy post March next year. It'll be our second year living together, but our first year living together without housemates. For context: 

- We will most likely have a small yard, 3 bedroom house that we are renting (rental laws here say that you can keep a pet as long as it's reasonable eg. No Dane in a studio apartment, etc) 

- We are pretty sold on getting a German Spitz (Mittel) from a Registered breeder 

- We are planning on crate training, and setting up a 'puppy apartment for when we are gone (max 4 hours at a time and not in the first few months) 

- We have money put aside for maintenance of our future pup, including for a complete care membership for a vet/petstore which will give us unlimited vet visits, yearly dental care, free vaccines, and free puppy school. As well as discounts on grooming and premium foods

- We have a training plan, and we are firm on only using positive methods. 

Some more context: 

- We are both students (I know, huge alarm) but we don't do most things that students do. 

- We don't drink

- Social outings are at friends houses or at ours are very calm, and pet friendly (think movie and pizza nights, D&amp;D)

- We have good friends who are great dog parents and it'd give us a great excuse to hang out even more 

- I have experience in helping in shelters with training and socialisation, my partner recently fully trained his brother's dog, so we know what we're getting into 

- I am planning on getting my Cert III in dogtraining

-We are financially stable 

We have done hours of research on training methods, people experiences training and owning Spitzs, requirements from what type of grooming brush to use, to what is an ideal diet for their coat, health and wellbeing. 
Are we going to be prepared?

My next issue is that a couple of our non-dog parent friends are staunchly #ADOPTDONTSHOP thinking that reputable breeders are doing the same damage as BYB. We've been given a few choice words by them, disregarding the fact that there was a lot of thought put into our decision, including that the shelters around us are full of large dogs (not good for our space) and medium bully breeds (I love them, but will not be equipped for them). I am also hoping to train my dog to help me with teaching puppy school when I get my cert. This requires a dog that has a predictable temperament. We are also not equipped to deal with the behavioral rehabilitation that may be required of a shelter dog. They just don't seem to be listening. How do I explain to them that this is my partner's and my decision that we made not because we want a 'designer dog' and status, but because we're being realistic about what we can handle?"	dogs

1016	[Help] Dog's favorite toy seems to cause him anxiety	My dog, Squirt, destroys stuffed toys extremely quickly, but it isn't much of an issue since the local pet store sells 2 small ones for 5 dollars. I usually buy two of these every few weeks to gives him. One day before heading out in the morning I gave him a plastic green bone that I fully expected to come home to destroyed, however, oddly it was completely intact when I got home. Half a year later he STILL hasn't torn it up and often puts it next to him when he sleeps and sometimes just presses his nose down on it to hear the squeaky sound, so I figure it's his favorite toy. However the problem is every once in awhile he'll pick it up and start pacing around the house with it and whining. Though he doesn't seem to want to play if I try taking it nor does there seem to be anything specific that starts these little episodes. So I was wondering if anyone might know why he does this?	dogs
1017	[Help] Person keeps cutting dog leash on purpose at the park.	"Need some advice. I have a 90 pound German Shepherd who hates people and, dogs because he's fear aggressive and not confident, that being said, same with my neighbor has dogs that don't like people, but like dogs.

Anyways we go to a park, it's not even a park it's a patch of unused forest, behind their homes. So, dogs and or people can do whatever but there isn't much people who go there. there is a sign that dogs must be leashed, so that's what my neighbor and I do. We leash our dogs and play fetch with a 50ft leash connected to our dogs. 

This person, keeps coming by with her big horse sized Great Dane I think it  and chucking her ball at my dog, who hates dogs, purposely trying to get her dog to come closer to mine when I told her not to. Her dog is off leash while ours is on leash following the sign rules which makes my dog nervous and snappy because her dog will charge him. 

I told her dog needs to be leashed blah blah blah, and in revenge the next day the leash was cut up in pieces. I can't make assumptions who did it, cause I didn't see her do it, but, come on obviously it was her because I told her off, she's been doing it for awhile tho.

Soooo I need help, what can my neighbor and I do? Is there any like super long leash a dog can play fetch on, but.. Cannot be cut or broken and can hold massive muscular dogs who are 90 pounds rather than a nylon that can be skipped with ease?

1018	[Discussion] What’s your dog’s daily exercise routine? And does my schedule look enough?	"I’m starting to wonder if I’m perhaps not exercising my dog enough and I want to know what other owner’s routines are to compare so I can reevaluate mine and adjust accordingly. No behaviour changes or problems to note, I guess I’ve just been spending a lot of time combing through this subreddit and as this is my first dog I’m raising, I just want to be sure I’m doing it right and being the best owner I can be. 

Dog info: 3 y/o rescue Canaan/Shepherd (more than likely a super mutt). She’s very calm but can be  skittish or nervous around new people/dogs. She doesn’t really play with toys and isn’t interested in balls, kongs, frisbees, or puzzles. She’s a healthy weight according to the vet. 

Mon- Friday:
- 1x daily walk, approx 3-5 km 
- 2x week, full day daycare ~ 8/10 hours 
- 1x daily training sessions in a big field, off leash for about 20 minuets in the middle of our walks

Sat-Sun:
- 1 x weekend hike, anywhere from 8 to 20 km (Feb to Oct only) 
- 1x daily walks, approx 3k (on non-hike day)
- 1x daily training (same as above) 

Do you think she’s getting enough exercise? I’m mainly concerned about the daily walks. She’s only getting one walk a day when most dogs I think get 2-3 walks a day. When we first got her she had a morning and afternoon walk (dog walker) each up to 30 minuets but she was refusing to go out in the mornings (around 5:30 am) I don’t know if she’s just lazy or if I wasn’t being forceful enough but she hates morning walks. When I could get her up and going she’d sit at the end of the street and refuse to go further. We canceled the dog walker because she was having similar problems.

My city truly is like a giant dog park. To see a dog on a leash is actually in the minority here vs. free range.  

I've been working on recall a lot with my pup. We spend loads of time in the middle of the field (cyclists are an attraction) and I love that other dog owners have been very free with advice as well as help. Yesterday, a standard poodle owner (gorgeous pup!) was patiently helping me with my pup staying while she walked away with hers -- this is really, really tricky for my pup still.

Also, when I apologize for xyz that my dog did, people are so great at saying ""She's just a baby, she'll get it"" or ""you're doing great with ___"". They'll offer tips, tricks, etc. 

She's come a long way in just the few weeks we've owned her and is an absolute joy to work with. We start actual puppy classes in a little over a week and I can't wait.

1020	[Help] Any advice for a first time (Border Collie) dog owner?	"Hi guys! 
So me and my boyfriend have been taking care of Bennie for about 2.5 months now. He was a surprise dog; I went camping with a friend, and a stray dog with no collar or chip wouldn't leave our site. I couldn't leave him there, and no one came looking for him, so I took him home.

He's about four or five according to vets. Doesn't have any major health problems thankfully! But we're using Bag Balm to get rid of some pretty nasty hyperkeratosis on his paws.

I didn't know he was part of the smartest breed until after I took him home, but he's honestly a weird one and doesn't really live up to his reputation. He's smart but not very energetic at all. He'll sniff dogs at the park but he doesn't know how to play with them. He's not neutered yet, so I'm wondering if once that's done he'll be less of an introvert. We give him a lot of attention and take him on decent walks, but he gets tired easily (not sure if it's because of his paws).

He's not super affectionate but he does like to be pet by us. However when we try and get him to jump on our bed to cuddle, he looks away from us. He seems not to want to intrude or something. Don't know anything about his history; there were some sheep and horse ranches around where I found him, so vets think he may have been a ranch dog. But considering his activity level and disinterest with other animals in general, I feel like that's not the case.

But then later on a third and then a fourt time. So we stopped doing the run then walk thing and I gave him a rest befofe just walking back home.

We went out at 7pm and he hadnt eaten since 10am (fed once we got home-late dinner) but he did have a few training treats especially on the walk (loose leash training)

He didnt seem out of it and ate his treats with no issues...but should I be concerned about him stopping **4** times to poo?"	dogs

I rescued her in april 2017 and my husband and I have worked super hard on rehabbing her of all kinds of issues. Recently though, whenever she gets super excited she will get very humpy. She will start licking my arm or leg or whatever and then start clawing at me and trying to mount. I always push her off, and immediately boot her off the bed/couch until she calms down. I also try to redirect her to a toy instead since it seems to be an energy thing. The toy redirecting does help, but often she will end up dropping the toy after a couple throws and trying to do the same problem behavior. I just wanted to know if anyone else had any other solutions. 

Also I want to note, I havent been able to take her on a lot of long walks bc the heat where I am is insane and it's just not safe for her to be out longer than neccessary. I know this could be a contributing factor to the problem behavior, but until it cools down I need some kind of solution. "	dogs
1027	[Help] Making the hard decision to let my dog go	"My wife and I have been having a hard time making this decision and I was hoping other peoples more objective opinions could help us. We recgonize our own bias and are so torn.
My dog PupPup(yes a super lazy name)is an 11 year old terrier mix that has congenital heart failure with a significantly enlarged heart that pushes on his trachea which only worsens his collapsing trachea and collapsing bronchia issues. We have him on various heart medicines as well as couph suppressant.
He has always been a lazy dog so its hard to notice how hes doing or feeling. Overall he seems to have become more lethargic and cant really go for extended walks anymore because he cant breath after a while and starts making a gasping sound with an goose honk cough. He also seems to be restless at night and often lays on the tile to try and cool down. We will hear him at night trying to get air as well as different parts of the day but its everyday at this point .
Other times he seems totally normal and eats food and water and will chase his tail and play, but his breathing seems to be getting progressivley worse and I'm concerned hes just suffering needlessly since his issues dont have a cure. 
Our biggest concern is we know hes going to succumb to his illnesses eventually but that could be who knows how long. Is it better to ease his passing now or do we wait until we somehow 100% know it is time. If we choose the latter it feels like we made him suffer so we wouldnt feel guilty and that is equally painful to us.

I'm just looking for peoples thoughts.

"My boyfriend’s old golden retriever has been an outdoor dog it’s whole life (his dad grew up on a farm and believes this is how dogs should live). He’s the happiest doggo but he’s getting old, I think around 12ish and I love him and want to take him to live with me because i think i could provide him with a better life. My boyfriend and his family are totally supportive of this and are in agreement. I was just wondering if anyone has any advice to house training an old dog. 

I also do live in an apartment so I’m also going to try to figure out a way to teach him to go to the bathroom on the balcony. (If you’re thinking an outdoor dog wouldn’t be happy in an apartment, please know that he’s so old all he wants to do is be around people who love him and to sleep in some air conditioning.)

Any advice or support would be greatly greatly appreciated!"	dogs

1033	[help] How to keep dog occupied while working from home?	"I have a 9 year old standard sized, long-haired dachshund. We rescued her when she was a year old. That entire time, my husband and I have both always worked full-time jobs, so she is left at home for a majority of the day, and given copious amounts of attention when we get home.

For the last few months, my husband and I have been working from home a day or two a week, because our jobs allow us to do so. The problem we both have with her: she sits at our feet and cries. And whines. And cries. And jumps. And whines. She will do this for HOURS until we give her attention in the form of picking her up to sit in your lap, play with one of her toys, or getting up to get her a treat from the kitchen. Once you put her back on the floor, walk away from the game, or she finishes her treat, she goes right back to doing the same thing. Over and over and over.

I fully understand that this is a result of rewarding bad behavior over the years (mostly due to feeling so guilty for being at work all day). But now that we're both staying home (not at the same time), she's driving us both insane. My husband has a worse time with it, because she does that while he's on conference calls.

​

So I'm coming to r/dogs and asking my fellow owners, what can we do to keep her busy while I'm working?? You'd think she would want to sleep, but instead she has the crazy energy of a puppy that no amount of pre-work walking can flush out.

1034	[Help] How can I give my dog bones or chews safely? She is a rescue dog and tends to scoff things down whole.	"I'd like to be able to give my dog bones and chews-- they keep her occupied and I know she enjoys them. She comes from a very food-insecure background, however; raised in an abusive environment, then found later on the streets near starvation. 

I know that competitive/unusually fast eating comes from this type of environment. It really poses a danger when I try to give her anything to chew on, however. She's a shih-tzu, so she's quite small, and I am very conscious of the potential for choking or intestinal blockage.

Does anyone have any advice as to things I can do to circumvent this issue? Or would it be better for me to continue to refrain from giving her anything? I have a pack of dental chews I bought for her a little while ago, and they're soft enough that I could cut them up, but I feel like that could really increase the probability of a choking or blockage issue."	dogs

1039	[Discussion] dog breed, size, color: effect on strangers or intruders	"\*I'm curious if there are statistics or studies that show which dog breeds or types (if any) are most ""threatening"" to strangers on a walk or a home intrusion. Linking those would be wonderful! I also welcome personal anecdotes if you care to share them.

​

First, I'd like to clarify that I'm not looking for a dog that is actually aggressive. I have no intention of getting an attack or guard dog. I would love an alarm dog (my understand is most dogs are good alarm dogs) and be especially drawn to a breed that would bark its head off should an intruder ever come into my house. So a dog that is aloof with strangers but *not* human aggressive would be great for me.

​

You're also probably wondering why I am sounding so damn paranoid about an intruder or being attacked on a walk. I do have PTSD and now that I live alone, I get so fearful at nighttime that I can barely sleep. I also get fearful going on hikes since the trails are often secluded. I am going to therapy for this issue, but I think what would help me feel the safest is to get a dog that might ""ward off"" strangers. I currently have a small dog and her companionship has helped me tremendously. That said, she is very small and she doesn't make me feel any safer at home or on walks largely due to the stigma surrounding small dogs--people run up to her all the time, sometimes even pick her up and pet her without asking. I feel that wouldn't happen so often with a breed such as a german shepherd.

​

This brings me to my dilemma. I love herding breeds, specifically GSDS and belgian shepherds. I especially adore dobermans and beaucerons (if I could choose just one dog to have for the rest of my life, it would probably be a beauceron) . The problem is that all these dogs tend toward DA or SSA. Beaucerons in the US also tend toward HA. I don't need a ""dog park"" dog, but I would like to eventually have 3...or 4...or 5 dogs lol. So it is important to me that I get a dog that will enjoy living with several other dogs.

​

This leads me to think that I need to stick with sporting breeds and sighthounds. But those of you with experience with herding breeds, please let me know if you think any of them would be a possibility in my situation. I think a poodle could be a great option for me--I'm told they're rather velcro, biddable (I will do sports with the dog), expressive, and athletic. My concern is the stigma other people have for poodles. Would a poodle not intimidate an intruder or potentially ward off an attacker while on a hike? Again, I mean by appearance alone and do not mean for the dog to actually engage an attacker. I'm thinking a black poodle, shaved close all over, might be the most intimidating. But what if I ended up with a red poodle and wanted a [haircut like this where the body is shaved close but the ears are longer?](https://trainthatpooch.com/the-majestic-poodle/). I'm also interested in vizslas (not aloof with strangers but still might be intimidating?), GSPs (potential DA?), dalmatians (DA?), whippets (not intimidating looking)

​

I know, I know, ""any dog is a deterrent"". But my friend has a small dog and her house was still robbed while she was sleeping. The dog was barking at the intruder and they just ignored it. I truly feel a larger dog of a different breed would be more intimidating. Thank you for reading this ridiculously long post and I hope I don't sound too crazy. As for my lifestyle: I will be doing a lot of training and exercise with whatever breed I get. I currently walk/run on trails for about 5 miles a day. With a larger dog I would also like to start biking.

**​**

**TL;DR: Are there any statistics showing which dog breeds or types are most intimidating to strangers or intruders; also open to personal anecdotes. Dog needs to be relatively healthy breed and able to live in a house with other dogs. I am very interested in poodles but I worry they would not make me feel any safe than my small dog just due to the way some people perceive them**

1040	[Help]Walks	So put bluntly I need help with info on how and when I should walk my dog. My dog is a husky/cocker spaniel mix, around 8-9 years so she’s pretty old, and she’s also pretty fat because she rarely goes outside except for bathroom. She also runs near full speed whenever she goes out for walks if thats important info. Because I now have time on my hands and because I’m the only one in my household physically able to take her for walks, I’m determined to make it a part of my routine. However the issue is I know little on what to do. How often and how long? She likes to run almost the entire time, so should i encourage this or make her walk? Any patterns or tips for just starting out? I know its a shame that she didn’t get her daily walks prior to this but I want to change that, any help is appreciated.	dogs
1041	[Fluff] Hiding treats and ratting	"We have 5 border terriers. Every morning and night after they eat breakfast and dinner, we hide treats all over the yard -- along the fence, around the patio, under and on the patio furniture, around shrubs. We get 10 treats and break them up and hide those pieces. 

When we start to let them out, we get them to the door and all excited (barking, turning, scratching at the door) and as soon as we open the door, they fly out. They all scatter different directions, noses to the ground, looking for the treats. They usually find almost all of them, and have learned over time to get really good at this. 

My dad also has a barn that has a major rodent issue. He let's our 3 cats in the barn while he's working, and the cats catch mice &amp; rats and flush them out while the dogs catch the runners, and then we freeze them and feed them to the snakes. "	dogs
1042	[Breeds] 1 year out speculation	"**Introduction**

Teensy bit of context: I've been mentally/emotionally ready for a dog for two years now, since I finished undergrad. But I'm just about to move from the US to the UK for a 1 year graduate program. I do not plan on getting the dog until the program is done, I'm just excited and anticipating. Depending on employment status, I may remain in the UK and get a dog there, or I may move back to the US and get a dog here.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, but for the last year I've been primary caretaker for my parents' 11 yr old labradoodle, for 2.5 years I worked at a dog daycare and volunteered at the city shelter, and for 4 years I've been a dogsitter. I also interned with a dog trainer doing puppy classes.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* First dog, probably rescue because I'm ready for a dog and know that purchasing from a breeder can take months to years. I'm also not sure I'm ready for puppyhood.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Young, energetic, comes with or easy to train an off switch, cuddly, handler engaged, smart/innovative (yes I know...). A dog who will encourage me to go run in the morning and then sack out on the couch. Dream right now is a border collie (if in the UK) or an aussie (if in the US). Both are readily available in rescues in those locations and have the get-up-and-go I'm looking for. But those are both a lot of dog.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I LOVE herding dogs. I love their focus and drive and the problem solving attitude they bring to everything (even if there isn't actually a problem to solve). I'm also a big fan of terriers. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Probably start in rally-o but I'd love to do agility and/or obedience. In the future I'm interested in bitework and herding but those take more time and money than I think I'll have in a year. This in addition to standard obedience and any tricks I can think up. As above, I'd like the dog to run with me so good leash manners will be a priority.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 30-90 minute run (depending on where I'm at in my plan) plus 1+ hour walk, plus 2-4 (depending on where the dog's at) 5-10 minute training sessions. If (as is likely) I'm in an apartment, as many potty breaks as needed, and meals will almost certainly be done in a puzzle toy. So total, minimum of 1 hr 45 minutes of one-on-one interaction every day. Usually at least 2 hours.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I already go for a 1 hour walk a day and additionally a half hour run every other day, both of which the dog will be welcome on (once manners and joints are up to par for the run). Also a weekly dog sport. I have had good luck historically with dog parks but if the dog's not interested, that's fine too. On weekends when the weather is good, I go for hikes.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm open to hair trims and ear cleaning at home. I'm also willing to go to a groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium! Most apartments here have a weight limit around 50-60 lbs. I don't know about the UK but some time in the dog's lifespan we'll be back in the US. I'm not a big fan of tiny dogs, so at least 10 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is no big deal. Excessive barking is not my favorite thing, but I don't mind warning barks or quiet grumbles. Not a big fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Nifty if we can do it, no big deal if we can't.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggles! My parents' dog likes personal space and I really want someone to cuddle with.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* ... both? I want a handler-focused problem-solving dog. So more on the eager-to-please, but not to the point of stupidity.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A few barks and then a controlled greeting. I don't want a stranger-aggressive dog, but I can manage and train either excessive greeting or fear. I would like a dog who warns me of approach. On walks, ignoring strangers would be excellent.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Separation anxiety. My parents' dog has it, and it really makes it hard for me, as an anxious person, to leave her alone without feeling guilty. I don't want to feel guilty! I know that a lot of handler-attached dogs are SA prone and I'm willing to do some work initially, but as a rule, no big hysterics when I leave.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This is the mystery. I'm not going into a field with a lot of standard 40 hour work weeks, but I just don't know.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* When I get the dog it'll be just me. Eventually I'll move in with my girlfriend, and she also likes smart active dogs. She'll be the backup but I'll be the primary caretaker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Girlfriend is going to be getting a cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* As a rule, US apartments don't like bully breed mixes, GSDs, or other stereotypically dangerous breeds. I've also found they tend to have weight limits around 60 lbs.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Next year, Edinburgh UK and yes, no pits. After that, Tampa Florida, and not to my knowledge.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In Edinburgh it'll be about 15 C (60 F) in the summer and 4 C (40 F) in the winter. In Tampa, 85 F (27 C) in the summer and 65 F (18 C) in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I know I have a big life change coming up. I'm willing to wait until I return to the states to get a dog. I also know things will shift based on my rental status and employment. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether the breeds I'm interested in would be a good fit for me--and what others might work too.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

* It feels like I'm always one year away from being in the perfect place to get a dog. Does this ever get better or do I just need to say screw it and get the dog?"	dogs

1044	[Breeds] Help in choosing the right dog for me	"** Hi! I am looking to get a puppy sometime in the next couple of months, however I cannot decide on a breed. Australian shepherds catch my attention the most, but I worry that I won't be able to fit their activity requirements. I plan on doing lots of exercise with it but everything I read about the breed makes me worry that I won't be enough for it. I've taken various quizzes but I always get small breed dogs, which I'm not really interested in.. Idk, I've answered the subs questionnaire below **

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have always grown up with dogs so I'm not exactly sure how to go about answering this question, I have never had a dog that was solely my responsibility. I always helped in potty training and used to attend training classes with my cousin and her dog, which I plan on doing with my own as well.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* At the moment I think I prefer the idea of going through a breeder, however I'm not opposed to rescuing or adopting from a shelter, I just find it to be more difficult. In my area the majority in shelters and rescues are pit bulls, which I adore, but sadly the majority of homes in my area will not allow the breed.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My only real set in stone idea is a female medium/large breed. I love the look of a merle Australian Shepherd, and I will always be a sucker for blue eyes, of course neither of these are requirements for me. I also would like something with the same fur length as an aussie.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* As I stated above, I have been highly interested in Aussies, but the activity level is what worries me.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Of course, I plan to train basic commands such as sit, roll over, lay down, etc. I would also like to teach more advanced things like how to put away toys or jumping through hoops and stuff, I do plan on taking classes to help.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I am a college student and a part time waitress. I work Saturday-Monday with a maximum shift of 5 hours. I have school Monday-Wednesday for a maximum of 2 and a half hours. In future semesters I still plan on spreading out my classes enough to spend time with pup in between. I will be walking before and after work and classes.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I plan on walking 2 or 3 times a day. Around my neighborhood. The closest dog park is about an hour away so I could make that work once a week along with the occasional hiking trail.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am more than open to fully grooming myself, well, I would need to learn how to properly do ears as that is something that would worry me. I do not mind going to the occasional groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I would like a medium/large sized dog. Nothing smaller than an Aussie, nothing near the size as a Great Dane.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding and I can deal with barking, however I would prefer a dog that does not slobber/drool obsessive. I understand it as an occasional thing but I can't deal with constant drool lol

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This isn't something important to me. I worry about animals running in the road so I would always have mine leashed in my area. My boyfriend lives more in the country so as long as my dog is properly trained to be off leash and come when called I could deal with being off leash there. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm a sucker for snuggles. My dog doesn't have to be under my feet 24/7, though I wouldn't mind if they were. But I would like a dog that wouldn't mind cuddling with me at night.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I'm not sure how to answer this one either. I don't mind my dog doing whatever (as long as it's not destructive) when I am doing something around the house or homework or something, but I would like for them to be responsive and cooperative when asked to do something like sitting or coming when called.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind barking when someone knocks or enters my yard, as I know it can actually keep burglars at bay at times. I do want my dog to be friendly towards others and show no aggression. I know this will require socialization on my part.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would prefer my dog not be aggressive towards other dogs. I know this will also require socialization on my part. Once I graduate college and get my own place I'm sure I would get more dogs and possibly a cat as my boyfriend is a cat person. I'm studying veterinary so I'm sure I'd come home with animals in that profession lol.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing else that I can think of.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* As I stated before, no longer than 2.5 hours at a time on the days I have school and no longer than 5 when I have to work. I do plan on taking a week off the week that I get a pup.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* None of my other family members really care too much, it's just my mother and two younger siblings. My siblings would surely love to play with it and I could help teach them a little of responsibility by letting them help me care for it. I would like to think my mom would help with walks if I can't but I can't count on her for that. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I would like to have more pets in the future, but that will be a while from now. My cousins have a mix breed and a chihuahua we would do play dates with though.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I have a 7 and 8 (almost 8 and 9) year old brother and sister but they are the youngest in my family.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent at the moment and will probably rent for the next couple of years. As far as I know my current place has no restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live a little south of Atlanta, Georgia. As far as I know there are no breed banning laws. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* It can get up to the 90s in the summer (Fahrenheit) and usually in the 40s in winter, but it will occasionally go into the 30s.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

Some of you might’ve seen my post a few days/weeks ago about this, but now it has a part two. This disgusts me. This is animal abuse, and people are too ignorant to see that and it got so popular to warrant a sequel. It sickens me that people can’t see how abusive and unhealthy these corgis’ lives are. Assuming this is how they always are with each other, this is torturous to them. I don’t get how someone can think this is cute or funny. Would they also think someone punching their dog and the dog yelping is cute and funny? How revolting. And to add insult to injury... now I’m no health expert, so I could be wrong, but those dogs look *heavily* overweight. Very unhealthy. I feel so bad for the dogs, their lives are awful because of their awful owners. And everyone thinks it’s cute. It makes me angry. But the owners don’t care, because free YouTube views right! "	dogs

My brother had the end with the clips on and I thought it’d be funny to see how the dog reacted if we let them reel in by letting go (she finds the hose hilarious when we reel it in and likes to chase it round, I assumed the reaction would be the same) so he let the first one go and all was well, dog found it amazing, we had a laugh. Onto the second one. 
This went significantly worse and, long story short, my elbow is 3x the size and black with the imprint of the metal clip in it... and that ladies and gentlemen is the story I now have to tell the doctors and nurses at a&amp;e when they ask while I wait to find out if my elbow is broken, because I played about with the dog lead.

She is currently on Peroxicam that she takes one pill daily. That has kept it at bay fairly well as she rarely does the reverse sneeze anymore. However, you can tell she is still congested. 

Has anyone run into this before? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I know shes ""getting up there"" but this dog got me through a serious bout of depression in college. If it weren't for her I wouldn't of graduated and probably wouldn't be around anymore. I want her to be comfortable and live for ever. It's the least I can do for her after all shes done for me. "	dogs

1050	[Help] My 8-month old doodle keeps regurgitating water.	"Hey, looking for any help I can get here.

I have an 8 month old goldendoodle. As the title says, he keeps regurgitating JUST his water after he finishes drinking. Sometimes it's a couple minutes after drinking, other times it's 30 min later. The only time any food comes up, it's just small pieces if he ate and drank in the same sitting.

He isn't vomiting. We dealt with that before and there are no violent hiccups or anything. Just a very quick regurgitation of a bit of water. And it's not ALL of the water, just some of what he drank.

I also don't see much bile along with it.  No yellow bubbles or anything. Seems to just be water and maybe some saliva. 

I think it's because he may be drinking too fast but even when I give him just a little bit of water, he will still sometimes regurgitate that, just obviously less. He also is not noticeably less energetic either.

Hoping for some help. Thanks!"	dogs

1054	Which breed for young family? [Breeds], [Help]	" 

We are looking at getting our 1st dog (both my husband and I had family dogs as children but not as adults) and would love to get some advice on which direction to start looking into!

Our 5 year old son has just been assessed as being a 'high emotional needs child' so thats definitely a factor but we were talking about it abit before that too. We have an 8 year old also.

I'm home most of the day, most days (while my husband travels for work often so is away alot), so I would love an affectionate buddy to have around (although obviously Im not home 24/7 so dont want a dog that will destroy the house if its left alone more than afew hours on occasion). I'd likely do 1-2 walks on weekdays and on the weekends we like to do a decent walk in the bush/at the beach etc as a family.

We have 2 cats which we've had for years. Our house has a big backyard and is fully fenced.

Would prefer one that doesnt have any intense grooming needs. 

So overall - a good family dog - very affectionate and cuddly but also keen to play with the kids and get out for some walks with me. Happy with loads of time around people but also wont wreck the house/backyard if its alone for an afternoon..

So excited to hear what you think!"	dogs
1055	[Help] How do you keep from being discouraged when training a rescue dog and there is little progress?	"Stella is a really well trained rescue dog. I have only had her for 3 months. She knows sit, stay, down, jump, speak, shake. She doesn't counter surf, drink from the toilet and only dumpster dives when nobody is home. She walks with a loose leash until she sees another dog... then she goes into full on puppy-mode, jumping and pulling and barking and circling. But she is not a puppy; she's a 90lbs Labradane and has over 300lbs of pulling force. 

We started with a prong collar per her rescue recommendation, but it cut up her neck due to missing hair (allergies). So we have been using a martingale instead. Every time we see a dog, I make sure she has seen it for a second, then I get her attention back on me and treat her. Right now we can get within 100ft of another dog before I nearly dislocate my shoulder. 

It's just so discouraging to have major slip-ups, like last week when I didn't see a puppy until we were at the top of a hill and Stella dragged me to the bottom of the hill. Today it was dark and I didn't see the dog until 30ft away. The other Lab just walked right past us like we weren't even there, meanwhile Stella is doing the mambo on the leash.

I don't have access to a training facility right now (and the thought of bringing her to a building full of dogs terrifies me). How do you not want to quit and become a hermit with your dog?

1061	[help] training methods info	"

Hi guys. So in the future I want to someday get a dog. (Definitely not in the near future) but i always like researching dog training methods and have become a bit confused and lost now. I’m getting two very different methods. There is the positive reinforcement method and a dominance or “natural” method.

 they seem to be at odds with each other.  I have recently found a dog trainer that suggests the more gruff and dominant training style. I personally have always sided with positive reinforcement but the dogs she has trained seem totally fine and socially with people and other dogs, great even. They seem well behaved and obedient. How is that achievable?  

It really confuses me because when i looked into dominance training usually the outcome is a scared dog scared of its owner. Yet its not the case? They have put up quite a few video showing their dogs behavior and how they train them. I wanted to know though if her methods are a good idea. Show you mix methods? Should i just stick to positive reinforcement? 

Heres an example of her training: 

(Socializing with unfamiliar animals)
https://youtu.be/vg0C34V4xZU
You could watch the whole video but 2:14 is a good start to see what the training method is like. 

(Dog park interactions)
https://youtu.be/JZwqo5Sqo8A
At 0:48 is a good start just to show how her dogs act with other dogs

(Dog disciplining)
https://youtu.be/1mBz9OFujyE
5:20

My goal with this post is to have a conversation about the two methods and why and how they are effective. I really want to believe that positive reinforcement is the way to go but seeing her dogs act so nice seems odd to me. It makes me think maybe thats also a good training method.  


Thanks guys! "	dogs

1063	[Help] I rescued a Dachshund who was/is overweight.	"Tl;Dr: my rescue dog was extremely overweight when I got him. Is there any advice anyone could give to help him lose weight?

Hello there! Around 3 years ago I received a Dachshund named Harley from my extended family. At the time when he arrived he was ~39lbs. Extremely overweight. Could only walk for short distances and it broke my heart to see him in such a condition. I learned that his previous owners had fed him not just scraps, but entire meals fit for human consumption, and tons of fast food.

I don't have any pictures of him on hand when he was that large but believe me when I say he used to look like the Dachshund from this video

https://youtu.be/qqofYX7vK-s

His current pictures: 
https://imgur.com/a/KPcysGg

After 3 years he's come down a lot on his weight near half, we're about to go for an annual checkup and I'll know his actual weight then. He's able to run now and even plays with our Chihuahua. However him losing has been stagnant for a while. We took him off human food when we got him and  he's been on small dog breed food. He gets fed twice daily, but likes to sneak to the big dogs bowl and grab a few bites. I'm writing now to hopefully get some advice from y'all. I'm going today to buy a small pool for him to practice water exercises, and I plan for more trips to the local dog park when my work and school schedule frees up. 

Is there any sort of meal plan that would help him get to a more ideal normal weight for Dachshunds?

Any specific exercises to help his movement and breathing without over exerting him? 

Lastly is there any sites anyone could link me to for more information about on dog weight loss?

Thank you.

1067	[Help] What options do I have for a rescue w/ awful separation anxiety that barks when I arrive?	" 

Sorry for yet another MY DOG BARKS TOO MUCH post, but I'm really out of ideas. I absolutely DO NOT want to put a basket muzzle on my dog, but I don't know what else to do.

Quick background: my dog is a 6-yr old Chihuahua-Jack Russel mix. I rescued him from a shelter who had him for a few years because nobody would adopt him. He was abused as a puppy and skittish of everything and has AWFUL separation anxiety.

He's crated with my other chihuahua mix for 10 hours during the work day (split into 5 hour parts, thanks to dog walkers). Whenever someone comes home, either when the dog walker picks him up or when I get home from work, he barks incessantly from the second he hears the front door knob turn until someone tells him to be quiet. The crate is in the living room so it takes about 20 seconds or so until I'm able to quiet him down. I can only imagine what the neighbors think during those 20 seconds (especially if I'm out at night and it happens at 1-2 AM).

Ignore him when he starts barking, then shower him with affection once he quiets? Tried it, he just kept barking and barking. Eventually my other dog started barking too.

Exercise him more? I take him for a 30 minute walk before I leave for work (around 8:30a), and he gets another 30-45 minute walk with the dog walker (around 1:30p). Doesn't help.

Leave toys in the crate? This dog can care less about toys, even if they're stuffed with delicious treats.

Work on his separation anxiety? I took one month off from work to work with a dog behaviorist and help his separation anxiety, that's $1000 I flushed down the drain.

I'm on the verge of letting this dog go, but I really don't want to. The barking isn't the only reason, but it certainly doesn't help. If I surrender this dog, nobody will ever adopt him again, and I don't want him to die.

I can't bring myself to put a basket muzzle on him - especially since he's already in a crate. But I'm at a loss here, I've tried so many things and nothing helps."	dogs

1069	[help] doggie nightmare fixes?	"So about 4 months ago my husband and I adopted a pittie mix, female, spayed, 2 years old. We don’t know much about her history, except that she’s been in various shelters for the majority of her life. She’s very sweet, sassy and has begun opening up to us a lot more. Love her to bits. 

She has some idiosyncrasies, like she does not like being touched in her abdominal or back leg area by your feet, especially when you have food. So I assume she was kicked badly multiple times, though she doesn’t have any injuries from this. She doesn’t bite, just barks and backs away. Similarly, she hates black dogs, possibly because her kennel mate was a black dog who had left a lot of bite marks on her when we adopted her (a while other story).

She’s generally a good sleeper at night, and her bed is next to ours. (Yes, we tried a crate, she wouldn’t even enter the room even for fave treats and cried when we tried to coax her; we decided it wasn’t worth her emotional anguish, please don’t lecture on that) Like most dogs she dreams and while usually they’re nice dreams where she’s relaxed and just making cute whooping sounds, sometimes she gets growly or worse. 

This has happened twice now: she bolts up into a run from a dead sleep. The first time she was pointed longways in the room and ran and barked for a couple feet before waking up. Last night, she bolted up and straight into the mirrored closet door. Aside from having the ever loving shit scared out of us, nothing was damaged and she was fine, but shaken up. Soothed her and she went back to sleep. But is there something we can do to try and cut down on this? I don’t want broken mirrors or dented walls, which is a real possibility since she’s 50 lbs of pure spooked pupper. I don’t really want to put her on anti-anxiety meds as she’s normally very calm and doesn’t have other anxiety issues. Is this just a matter of waiting it out and letting her issues get forgotten, or???

(Also, we’ve tried moving her bed to the more open area of the bedroom, but she’ll wait till we’re asleep and drag it right next to my side of the bed. So placement change is difficult lol)"	dogs

Neighbor a house down has a black lab that apparently gets loose. He spotted us and came over. I got tunnel vision and worked up very fast because I do not take well at all to loose dogs. I got between me and my dog, who has no idea the other dog is there. I start yelling at the dog to leave, but he manages to get around me and sniff at my dog (who gets startled and later started barking). I try to stay between them and pull them both away, and kick the dog away (physical blows that made contact) a few times while yelling at him to leave. Eventually he steps aside again but won't leave. His owner hears my yells (which is screeches of rage with the way my voice carries) and eventually comes to get his dog after staring at us for a minute. I was so pissed when that dog came over that I didn't stop to think maybe he WASNT being aggressive. No barking, bared teeth, etc. But the safety of my dog is paramount so when he didn't leave it only worked me up more. Could I have done something different to keep the dog away?

I am now going to buy some dog deterrent spray. Sprayshield looks good because I don't want pepper spray. Any recommendations?

1080	[Breeds] Breed-Specific Questions for English Cocker Spaniel Owners	"I'm getting my first dog in Spring 2019 and have decided on getting a **show-type English cocker spaniel**. Like with any breed, I've read good and bad things about them but after months of research I think this is the breed for me... \*but\* I still have a couple of reservations.

**I would really appreciate input on one or more of the following points from anyone who has had contact/experience with the breed before. Even if it's an anecdotal story on one of the points it would still be useful!**

1. **Cocker spaniel rage -** I keep reading snippets on various websites about solid-coloured cockers having an issue with rage. I am aware that it's a very rare genetic thing, but other than going to a reputable breeder, is there anything else I can do to avoid dogs with this condition?
2. **Colour vs. Temperament -** Other than the rage condition, does the coat type (solid/parti) really have that much of an effect on the temperament? A breeder with whom I spoke told me that I should avoid solid cockers as it's going to be my first dog.
3. **Trainability -** I had previously also shortlisted golden retrievers because I had the impression that they're more suitable for first-time owners. I'd prefer a smaller dog, though, so could someone please give me an indication of whether cockers are relatively okay to train? 
4. **Stubborn/attention-seeking behaviour -** People keep telling me that their 'friend of a friend of a friend's cocker spaniel' used to chew the walls/attack other dogs/tear the curtains/run away/etc. Not sure what to think of these as they're stories from people who don't actually own cockers. Given your experience, would you say that these are normal behaviours, probably one-off incidents or probably down to bad training?

I've always been a cat person, never really been into Dogs but this one had grown on me over the last 5 years I've known her. 

My wife once had another dog that belonged to her ex who was a trained cat killer, and I once came home to him killing a kitten and almost killed the dog myself out of anger. I didn't harm him, but I never looked at him the same and didn't shed a tear when I learned that he had been killed by a car (ex took dog back a few years ago). Fuck that puto.

My wife called me crying her eyes out yesterday and told me what the dog had done. I was calm when we spoke but have been angrier at the dog since.

I don't want to walk her, talk to her, look at her. I know it's fucked up but all I want to do is beat her ass. I won't really do it in all likelihood, but I can't help feeling like it. 

We had developed  good relationship with daily long walkies, but all I see now when I look at her is red.

We have 4 cats that she doesn't bother, but had it been one of them I'm not sure I could have stopped myself from putting her in the doggy hospital or worse going old yeller on her ass.

1084	[PSA] [Discussion] [Story] My dog lost half her tongue due to injury sustained from a ball.	"One of my three dogs, Arai, is obsessed with anything spheroidal. Dog balls? Yes. Basketballs? Yes. Horse balls? Yes. Melons? Yes. If it's spheroidal, she wants it. She usually has one in her mouth.

Just about a month ago now, Arai got her tongue stuck inside a hard rubber ball from BarkBox Super Chewer subscription. The ball had one hole about 1cm wide. She had a fairly large (but proportionate) tongue, and when she bit down on the ball, the one hole created suction, sucking her tongue in. Because it was a super chewer ball, it was hard and she couldn't get it back off.

Because she always has a ball in her mouth, we didn't think anything of it until she wouldn't put it down to eat (food &gt; balls). It was on there ~6h (less than most people are gone for work every day). We tried to get it off, first relieving the suction by drilling a hole, and attempting to use oil to lube it off - it wouldn't budge. We rushed her to the emergency vet, where it was removed under sedation. Over the course of several days and many trips in and out of vets' offices, we were finding her to be getting worse and not better.

After a trip to UC Davis, we learned her tongue had necrosed due the loss of blood flow because of the tight fit of the ball on her tongue. She had to have 9cm of the end of her tongue removed (by laser!). All of her vet care amounted to about $3000USD. She will never be able to clean herself again. She will never be able to cool herself effectively ever again if she gets too warm. She has had to learn how to drink and eat with half her tongue gone.

We reached out to BarkBox and found out the ball was supposed to have a ""plug"" in the hole - this is a common design for their products, a squeaker plug in a hole of a ball. They were so apologetic and empathetic.

They are going to reimburse us for the cost of her vet care for this injury, and are sending items for her new special needs (a special watering dish and a cooling mat since we're moving to a hot place for the military). BarkBox has been prompt and sincere in making sure this situation is taken care of correctly. Although I wish it hadn't happened, I'm so glad they stepped up and are doing the right thing.

Be aware of balls with only one hole, because although it's kind of a freak accident, it can cause serious consequences. And before anyone says it, yes, we take responsibility too for not keeping a closer eye on her. We do and will continue to ache over our contribution to her injury.

Love your dogs. Play with them. Keep an eye on them. I don't blame BarkBox but I appreciate their taking responsibility and attempting to right a wrong.

Edit to add: I wanted to share this so as many people as possible know that this kind of thing can happen. I don't want anyone else's baby to become permanently altered/injured. Arai was lucky, but another may not be.

1085	"[Discussion] ""The Heart of the Matter"" - short article by Dr. Linda Case about taurine-deficiency DCM and how it may be correlated to some grain-free foods"	"[**Edit: Here is the link to the article, I somehow forgot to add it when I first posted this.**](https://thesciencedog.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/the-heart-of-the-matter/)

I figured some of you may be interested in this article written by Dr. Linda Case. It was shared on Facebook by Dr. Patricia McConnell, that's how I found out about it. I hope my title was worded appropriately and not in a biased way.

Quick and brief overview of the article:

Dr. Case talks about what taurine is, as well as how diet may influence taurine status. She also briefly talks about what breeds and factors may predispose a dog to having taurine deficiency.

Dr. Case explains that, as far as we know, it seems like the dietary factors that may be associated with DCM in dogs are similar to the ones in cats, which include foods with ""low protein levels, poorly processed or heat-damaged proteins \[...\], and the inclusion of a high proportion of plant-based protein sources such as peas and legumes."" She also mentions that specifically in dogs, other foods associated with DCM include ""lamb meal and rice diets, soybean-based diets, rice bran, beet pulp, and high fiber diets.""

We all know how highly debated dog diets are within the dog world. Ultimately, this seems to be the advice given by Dr. Case: ""a recommendation is to feed a food that contains sufficient levels high quality, animal-source protein, does not include plant-source proteins as its primary protein source, and does not contain high levels of dietary fiber."""	dogs
1086	[fluff] Firefighters rescued my dog	"Yesterday, I was getting ready to take Lucy to my parents' yard where they have a huge backyard to zoom around in.

I put my bag in the car, dog in the car, and walked around to get in the driver's side when I heard... KA-CHUNK.

Lucy had pressed the lock button.

My car keys and phone were locked in. My parents were away. They keep a spare car key, but *my* spare to their house was with my car key--in my bag. 

So I ran to my neighbor's house. Thankfully she was home and helped me call the city's non-emergency line. I explained to the dispatcher and they sent a firetruck out. After a little while, and with miraculously no damage to my car door, my Lucy was LIBERATED! She was fine!

1088	[help] My foster dog attacked me earlier today. I'm not sure where to go from here.	"This is kind of a long story, so I apologize in advance for the amount of text. See the TL;DR for a summary.

​

So I took in a dog last week.

​

I've been wanting to adopt a dog for a few years now. I'm finally at a point in my life that I can have one, so I've been looking at shelters in my area for a dog to fit my lifestyle. Recently I found this dog at a nearby shelter and took immediate interest in him. He's a 7 year old dog, which seemed perfect for me since I work full-time and therefore don't have enough time to train a puppy, but have the capability to have him with me at work if he's well-behaved. According to his profile and the shelter, he's a very sweet and calm dog that is friendly around people. I met him last week during a visit to the shelter and confirmed that he is in fact a calm and sweet dog. He seemed like the perfect fit for me. Since I took him in, he's been an angel for the most part. He usually is very calm, as the shelter suggested. He doesn't bark or pull on the leash. He's house trained already. He's been friendly towards everyone that he's met so far.

​

When I showed interest in this dog, the shelter told me they would like me to foster him first, since he has a few medical issues that they wanted resolved before letting anyone adopt him. Initially this included finishing up a heartworm treatment and getting a simple surgery done to remove a growth in his year. After I took him in, it became clear pretty quickly that there is a lot more wrong with him than that. He has a laceration on his eye from a dog fight he got in at the shelter, as well as a torn eyelid from the same incident. He has a cough that causes him to throw up multiple times a day. He has a yeast infection on his skin that makes him itch constantly. He also has a severe ear infection from the tumor, which I found out yesterday (from the vet) that is potentially malignant and could require a full ear canal removal if it's deep enough. All in all, he's got a lot of problems. I don't mind treating them, since he seems like such a sweet dog, but now I'm not so sure. He does growl a bit when I give him his eye drops, but hasn't bitten me yet. I haven't tried cleaning his ears yet, since I only was told yesterday at the vet that I need to start treating the infection he has as well (I was told not to previously since the infections are coming from the tumor and it is supposed to be taken out next week).

​

I took him to the vet yesterday, and things kind of fell apart from there. I took him out to go for a walk before leaving to take him to the vet, but he ended up having an accident at the vet. While there, the vet told me about the tumor and the yeast infection and the ear infection that all need to be treated. Then, when I got him home, he peed inside my apartment. As I have been doing since I got him, I took him out before I went to bed around 10:30pm. He's never had an issue holding his pee until the morning, but during the night he peed again. When I woke up and saw it, I immediately tried to clean it up, he was sort of standing in front of it, so I grabbed his collar to pull him aside so I could clean it up, at which point he attacked me. He bit me several times on my right arm/hand and once on my left arm. The bites were deep enough that the fat underneath the skin was exposed. My roommate called the paramedics and then took me to the ER. I'm all bandaged up now and have been set up with some antibiotics for the next few days, but now I need to figure out what to do with the dog.

​

This is the first time I've been bitten by a dog (I've grown up with them my whole life so this was surprising to me, even if he is a shelter dog). I'm not sure what set him off, really, and that concerns me. Part of me thinks that it was taking him to the vet that upset him, since he didn't start peeing inside until then. I was warned that he doesn't like the vet much, but while we were there he didn't seem too agitated aside from peeing on the floor. Another part of me thinks it's the medications he's being given (eye drops twice a day, eye lubrication twice a day, ear wash once a day, ear drops twice a day, 2 kinds of pills twice a day, and more to come) and he's frustrated with being poked and prodded constantly. If it's either of those two reasons, I'm at a loss as to what I should do. He needs the vet visits and he needs the medications in order to get better, but providing him with either of those things makes him dangerous enough that he'll attack anyone who gets too close. If his aggression isn't related to the medicine or the vet visit, I'm concerned about him attacking someone again for an unknown reason. I'm not really sure what to do now. Do I keep working with him and hope something like this doesn't happen again, or do I bring him back to the shelter? He needs help, that much I know. I don't want to give up on him, because he seems like a sweet dog, but I'm also worried about putting myself and others at risk. What should I do?

​

​

TL;DR My foster dog bit me several times today when I tried to clean up his pee. The bites were severe enough that I had to go to the ER. This is the first time he's shown this level of aggression towards me or any other person at the shelter he came from. It might be related to the large amount of medications he has been taking (being fussed with too much), or to a vet visit from the day prior, or from some unknown reason. I'm not sure whether to keep fostering him, which potentially puts myself and others at risk, or bring him back to the shelter and hope he finds a home that can handle this kind of aggression.

​

EDIT: spelling and grammar. oops.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thank you for all of the responses, everyone. I've dropped him off at his vet and he will be picked up by someone from the shelter tomorrow. Based on all of your responses, it's likely that he will do this again, and unlikely that this behavior can be trained out of him considering his age.  It's unfortunate that things didn't work out, but based on responses in this post and advice I've received from every friend and family member I've contacted about this issue today, sending him back seems like the right choice. Luckily, I'll be sending him back to a no-kill shelter. I notified them earlier today about the incident, so they know to watch out for that in the future (I also notified animal control as well). However, the woman I spoke to isn't convinced that he's a risk to people, but thinks that he's simply in pain because of his medical issues. I hope that they're able to fix him up and find him a good home that's willing to take on an old dog with his kind of behavioral and medical record. "	dogs

1097	[Help] Flea infestation, Seresto and a senior dog w/heart disease - Couple of questions (Long post)	"Hello! I had a quick question that I was hoping I could pose to the group before I call my vet in the morning. Ultimately, what I'd like to know is if it's safe to use the Seresto collar on my dog. Quick info on my pup:

- She's 13 years old
- Cockapoo
- Weighs ~35lbs
- Is on pimobenden and lasix for congestive heart disease (has been since July of 2017)
- Has had heartworms in the past (she's a rescue, and was treated back in 2010 when I got her), and because of this has a slight heart murmur
- Eats normally, poops normally, drinks normally... sleeps a lot, which I expect is normal for such an old girl.
- I don't give her dog treats - she instead gets sliced fruit (apples) and raw carrots as treats. I don't see the need to add any sodium to her diet given the heart disease.
- Doesn't spend a lot of time outdoors. She goes out 3-4 times a day to do her business, and then she'll lounge on her bed and snooze the day away.
- Her bed is located in my bedroom, in the immediate left corner. There are no toys loose in her bed, and she never gets into my bed anymore (hardwood floors - I'm worried that at her age, if she ever tried to jump off, she'd hurt herself).

I am currently dealing with a flea infestation. In the 8 years I've had my dog, she has never had a flea infestation this badly. A little back story -

- 2 weeks ago, after realizing that she'd been itching for a week or so, I brought her to the groomer. She's had fleas before, and in the past, it's always only been - off to the groomer, shave down, flea dip, capstar, and start the monthly flea drops until the temperature drops. That always managed to take care of the issue. This time it is WILDLY different.
- While she was at the groomer, I fogged the house with Hot Shot foggers. After a few hours, I came back, opened the windows and vacuumed. After I picked her up, I put a new flea collar on her (I forget what brand now - I wish I had kept the damn tin, but I do know it was not a Seresto collar) and put some Hartz flea drops on her back. I also, for the sake of being thorough, threw out all of her old bedding and bought her a new bed, and myself new sheets (as is the norm for me the one time a year she usually gets fleas). Since I had not noticed anything out of the ordinary, I assumed the problem was nipped in the bud and would be taken care of at that point.
- Over the next few days the problem got SIGNIFICANTLY worse. I couldn't leave my bed without fleas jumping on my pants. Over this past week and a half, I have put out 5 flea traps, spread diatemaceous earth ALL over the bedroom floor, have bathed my dog with Dawn dish  soap, and have been vacuuming religiously - to the point where I don't enter or exit my kitchen without vacuuming it first. The fleas appear to be concentrated to the bedroom and the bedroom only! My living room and home office are virtually unaffected. The kitchen I honestly don't know, because it is the first room you step into outside of the bedroom. 
- It has been 3 days since I put the DE down and 4 days since I set out the flea traps. One thing that is striking me odd though is that my dog sleeps on the immediate left side of my room, and only leaves her bed to eat, drink, beg me for my dinner, and go to the bathroom. She never goes to the right side of my bedroom - never. 
- Last night I noticed something. The flea trap that is less than a foot from her bed caught the usual couple dozen fleas. The one on the RIGHT side of the room though... had caught HUNDREDS if not over a thousand fleas last night. The three prior nights, it had not caught anywhere NEAR that many, not even combined. It was like the flea god himself came down and said ""WAKE UP"" and every flea under the sun jumped into that flea trap. It was SO BAD that I put a cookie sheet down just to expand the trap area. This morning, after changing the trap water, I put a second cookie sheet down. There are now three traps on the right side of the bedroom, continuing to catch fleas as we speak.
- I have NO IDEA and I am extremely puzzled WHY this would be happening on the side of the room where the dog never goes. I can vouch for that being true too - I work from home, and for the sake of not spreading fleas all over the house MYSELF, I have spent every day of the past week and a half in this room with her. I also don't understand why THAT MANY fleas showed up just overnight! I mean, what!

Anyway! This weekend, I have a plan. After a week of reading everything I could find on flea infestations, I decided that tomorrow (payday for me), I'll be ordering a Seresto collar, 6 doses of Capstar and a flea comb. The plan is to bathe her again, take her outside, give her a Capstar (which I plan to give her everyday for the whole 6 days - then follow up with the Seresto collar on the 7th day), and spend the next however-long-it-takes amount of time combing her thoroughly. Once I'm confident that she has no more fleas on her, I'll take her inside and put her in her crate to quarantine her for a few hours while I deal with the bedroom. I'll also be buying a brand new vacuum cleaner (one that is not specifically made for hardwood floors, but instead has multiple floor settings and good suction power and crevice/upholstery attachments). Then I'll be sweeping up all the DE and vacuuming the hell out of the bedroom. At that point, I'll be bleaching all the floors in the apartment and letting them dry. Then, I'll be buying Precor 2000, which I intend to treat the bedroom floor with. 

I'll be continuing the regime of vacuuming constantly, because what the hell, I've been doing it a week and a half now, why stop until this is over, right? 

This entire experience has been a nightmare, and I really have just a few questions before I call my vet -

- Is the Seresto collar safe to use on an older dog with heart problems? If not, should I use the K9 Advantix instead?
- Will the bleach kill the adult fleas or larvae or anything? I have researched and can't really find a definitive yes or no. 
- Is all of this overkill? I feel like I'm about to wage actual nuclear war in this bedroom, but the fleas are so bad that she and I both are uncomfortable as hell.
- If you'd like to see pictures of the flea traps from last night - the left side (her side) vs the right side (the side she's never on), I'd be more than happy to post those so you can be disgusted along with me.

Sorry for the novel, but man, I just had to get all of this out. I am exhausted, mentally and physically and I just want to know that there is a light at the end of this hellscape tunnel in the relatively near future.

PS: A few other things that might be of note, I have no idea, but since I've written a ton already, I might as well include it:

- I live in a 150 year old house. My apartment is the 2nd floor of said house. There is one other apartment below me. There is one floor above me also, three rooms, that no one has been up to for nearly three years and the only way in is through my living room.
- There is one storage room at the end of my bathroom hallway, left exiting the door of my bedroom. It shares a wall with the right side of my bedroom. Again, no one goes into that room - it is full of empty boxes and old toys, records, etc, from the people who owned the house before my landlord. The window in that room was broken at one point earlier this year, but has since been blocked off. This was months back, February/March I believe. I have no idea if any critters managed to nest in there during the time the window was broken because as I said - I never, ever go into that room, and no one else has access to it.
- From what I've heard, the insulation in the wall between the storage room and my bedroom is horse hair. Again - 150 year old house.
- About 4 months ago, my downstairs neighbor had been saying his son was complaining of flea bites. They have no pets. Two weeks later, my dog was groomed (she's groomed every couple of months), and the groomer let me know that she had no fleas, but she did have three ticks removed. This problem started about a month AFTER that. I have no idea if my neighbor has a flea problem or not.  
- The basement of this house is a dry dirt floor, which has not been treated for pests to the best of my knowledge, since February of this year. I also don't believe the yard has been treated. The previous owners of the house used to put lime (lye?) on the basement floor and around the perimeter of the house, monthly - he said to control pests. I don't know.
- The house has significant vegetation and several trees around it, however the bushes/grass/weeds/ivy up against the house have not been trimmed down since February, when the new owners/landlords took over. Only the front yard is cut, weekly. The rest of the yard, including all the vegetation right up against the house, grows wild.
- As far as I know, my immediate right and left neighbors have no pets. I don't know about the neighbors behind the house. There is a stray cat that used to wander the yards every once in a while, but I haven't seen it since last summer.

There. I THINK that's everything. If I think of anything else, I'll let you guys know. But I am all ears if anyone wants to chime in on this situation and give me advice, be it on the collar or the fleas or if I'm doing ""the most"" or not doing enough. At the very least, writing all of this out has helped ease my anxiety a tiny bit. Thanks."	dogs
1098	[Help] Thoughts on DogPacer treadmill, cat wheel etc. for a small breed?	"I have heard and seen great things regarding exercise equipment for high energy dogs. But I was wondering if a DogPacer or cat wheel would be appropriate for a toy breed, and if so, what precautions I should take.

My dog is a 13 lb chihuahua who the vet says should be closer to 10. She is already down from 14.4 lbs, her original weight when I adopted her in June.

We take two 30-min walks per day along with backyard potty breaks and playing inside. A few times a week she gets to run around my parents' backyard. 

A DogPacer has been available on Craigslist since May. A cat wheel just got listed. Winter is just a few months away, and the climate here will make extended outdoor exercise impossible, especially for a chihuahua, during the winter months.

So I'm considering one of those. Any thoughts?"	dogs
1099	[Help] My terrier is being introduced to kittens and she's being a bit...lungy	" Hello everyone, I just wanted some advice on my terrier interacting with a new set of kittens.

​

So my baby Zenobia is amazing, she's precious and high energy Irish terrier mix, as best we can tell. We have had her since last December, and she has lived with our two cats since then, and loves to play with them (they do not enjoy it) and herds them around when they are being bad. She is around other cats at my grandmother's house when she is babysat there, and that cat is huge, and isn't afraid to yell at her and smack her about if needed, so she has a healthy interest in cats, is desperate to play and be played with, but has come to understand they are peers not prey.

​

My mother and I recently rescued some baby kittens, VERY young, we think three weeks when we found them. My mother has been fostering them and so they have grown up with her two massive dogs (who love and mother them) so they don't know fear of dogs. It's been several weeks and they are probably about 8ish weeks old now, about to go to the vet to confirm this week. I asked my mother if we could take one of the kittens when they are ready for adoption, and she agreed, but since i already have two cats, making sure that Z got along with the new baby was important. So tonight we packed up, got on our ThunderShirt, took some doggie calming meds, and went to greet the kittens.

​

At first she was just too high energy, overwhelmed with the kittens and smells (she has been to the house many times before, just not since the babies arrived). But we noticed she would lunge forward with her nose and is OBSESSED with their movement, which is not super shocking, given her breed i suppose, but she has never been this obsessed with my cats, in this way. she does her hunter's freeze, and has me worried.

​

I do want to be clear we have done cat introductions numerous times, all safeguards were in place, the kittens were not in any danger, to put anyone's mind at east.

​

We gave her a break, and tried again, always having her on leash and thoroughly controlled while kittens were being handled by me. We gave treats for calm interactions, and praise. She was better. But a few times she lunged/nudged at them and we would correct the behavior. In turns she was nervous, excited, and uncertain, and we tried to praise her at the appropriate times, letting the kittens climb on her to get her used to it, play with her ladybeard, and all of that she was good with, but when they would hop and move fast then she would get tense again. She did lots of good smelling and appropriate licks.

​

It was good but the lunging is making me nervous, is this something she just won't be able to handle, or is this something we just have to go slowly with, which we are very able to do. I would love any advice and opinions you had available! :)"	dogs

I'm unsure if maybe he is drinking too much water or if he has a bladder infection. If I let him out right after he does it, he immediately runs to the grass and pees. He has also been ringing the potty bell more frequently, but if I open the door sometimes he will just stand there and stare at me. I am calling the vet tomorrow morning to schedule an appointment.

1106	[Discussion] Coyote-proofing backyard - ideas?	\[Discussion\] Hi dog lovers.  Coyotes are getting more and more agressive in our neighborhood.  Looking for ideas to coyote-proof the part of the yard where the dogs do their business.  We've looked at the roller bars but neighbor hood aesthetic standards won't permit their installation.

1108	[help] Adopted dog after a month is over-the-top submissive and terrified of everything	"We adopted a two-year old female pom-shepard (no idea how this happens) from a local animal sanctuary and for the last month she's been a submissive mess. She's had a great loving environment with soft voices, reassurances, treats, etc. for over a month and her behavior doesn't seem to have changed even a little bit.

1. Anyone approaching her results in her dropping on her back and urinating all over the floor with her tail between her legs.
2. She doesn't like going outside. She will hide under the car until you let her back in the house. Any attempt to coax her out with treats, ""good girls"", pets, etc. just results in her rolling on her back as though you're about to start beating her.
3. Nobody has given her any reason to act this way since we adopted her. There's no yelling, no punishments (even if she gets into the trash or urinates on the floor). Just calm assurances and pets and laying around the house.
4. The only time this seems to change is when our blind yorkie-poo comes near her; often she will turn aggressive and begin growling at him. She has tried to nip at his head once when he got too close.

We don't really have the full backstory, but what the previous owner said was that she has always been incredibly submissive and was ""at the bottom of the totem pole"" around the sanctuary. Other animals included dogs, cats, donkeys, and goats free roaming; cows, pigs, and horses in pens.

She was covered in fleas and terrified of everything when we picked her up. She doesn't make a single sound unless its whining when you leave her alone in a room. 

Can anyone provide some context as to what we're dealing with and whether she can be brought back to happy doggo status? Or is this basically a life-long trauma she's got? It's frustrating trying so hard to be good owners and still being met with terrified looks any time you just wanna pat her head."	dogs
1109	[HELP] Basics walking a nervous dog! 3yo rescue.	"Hi!

TL;DR: where do I start to train my fearful 3yo heeler mix to walk beside my confidently and distraction free? 

My partner and I adopted a 3yo Heeler Mix last week and she has been an absolute sweetheart. Alice was found under a roadway (texas gate) out of the city with an injured puppy. She had no tattoo or chip and was in the shelter for about a month. They had no idea how long she had been stray. 

She seems to be well trained in everything but walking. She goes to her crate at night, never has to be locked up, only pees and poops outside, and doesn't beg or grab food. 

That's all we know. When we walk her she seems overwhelmed by traffic, people, dogs. Our area is very busy and she constantly stops to watch cars and people. She smells everything along the way. Then she will get to a certain area where she just will not go further and wants to turn back despite any amount of encouragement and treats.

I'd just like to know where to start in helping Alice conquer her fears. We are slowly exposing her and letting her walk as far as she can without forcing her to go further down the block. Treats aren't able to get her attention or motivate her on walks. I'm afraid when we take her to new places or the vet, she will just lay down and refuse to go with us.

I've seen lots of training videos for puppies but I'm not sure how to tackle fear/distraction with an older dog. 

Thanks for any and all advice!

1110	[Breed] What breed is right for me?	"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? - This will be my first time being the sole caretaker for a dog but I have years of experience sharing responsibility when it comes to pet care.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? - I would prefer a reputable breeder.

Describe your ideal dog. - I would like to be able to come home to a dog who will cuddle me to death but also is independent. I look for strong personality and high intelligence. Ideally I would like to train for obedience, possibly agility or other sport, but I also will need a dog who knows when to be active and knows when to chillax while I am gone at work. I would like a companion who can travel on the road with me, get along well with other animals, and live in a small to medium sized home or apartment.

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? - I am interested in Italian Greyhounds, Whippets, Dobermans (though I hear they have complicated health). I think their body conformations are beautiful and they are easily adaptable to their environments. I also think that they would take well to training.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? - Run/jog with me, hike with me, basic obedience, possibly agility.

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? - Any time I am not at work. I plan on being able to take them with me where I go if it is appropriate.

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? - I love dog parks, I love taking walks and hikes. They would be walked approx three/four times a day and hopefully I will have a good sized yard or field near by for them to enjoy some zoomies and a good game of fetch.

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? - I don't have any problem with at-home grooming. I can do it myself.

What size dog are you looking for? - Medium to large, but not too large. I could have a big dog so long as they are well behaved. I am a fairly petite person and I want to be able to adequately handle the dog.

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? - Shedding doesn't really bother me, barking does. I don't mind barking when it is necessary but otherwise I am not a huge fan. Slobber is also something I would like to avoid.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? - Very important.

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? - Snoogly!

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? - Mix of both. I don't want to constantly have to pay attention to them but I do want a dog who loves and listens to me and shows it.

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? - I would prefer them to greet visitors kindly but I also would like to take comfort in knowing they would protect me if they needed to.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? - I would definitely prefer not to have a dog who is aggressive towards other dogs so that they can come out on the town with me and enjoy other dogs' companies.

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? - Aggression.

How often and how long will the dog be left alone? - For some hours during a usual work day. But plenty of time will be spent together after work.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? - It's just me!

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? - Eventually I would consider having a cat or other dog. If I got another dog I might consider getting the same breed.

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? - No.

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? - I plan on renting in the future. Not ready to settle down quite yet. Not sure of what those leases would look like.

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? - I currently live in Illinois but plan on moving. Probably back to Oklahoma in the next year or two. No laws banning breeds that I know of.

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? - Usually in the high 70's- mid 90's."	dogs

1115	[Breeds] anyone have experience with Italian Greyhounds; are they cat friendly?	"Hi guys!

So, I’ve been thinking about getting a dog for quite awhile now. I have never owned one (have 2 male cats), but I have a very active lifestyle and have been thinking it would be awesome to have a walking/running buddy to come with me everywhere.

I saw an Italian greyhound out when I was at a coffee shop and couldn’t get over how cute and funny it was! From what I’ve read, they are very difficult to house train; however, as a nurse I’m fortunate enough to be home 4 days a week and my fiancé is able to work from home often. We are also moving to a warm climate within the next year (I would get the puppy after we are moved) which I read they are more favorable to. Our home is near a dog park as well!

What I can’t seem to find is if they are friendly with cats! My cats are rambunctious; they are like puppies that can climb on everything. I am not sure how a puppy/dog of this breed would react to that? 

I’m not rushing to get a dog; I want to do more research and learn how to train it properly, but I am really excited nonetheless! Anyone have any experience with this breed/how they interact with cats? Thanks so much for your help!"	dogs

1118	[Help] My dog's chest and neck are very red.. Why?	"Over the past few weeks, I've noticed my dog's skin has become red on his neck and chest. Some days are worse than others. Sometimes it's just pink, sometimes it's blood red. It doesn't seem to hurt him. If I touch it, he doesn't react. And he doesn't scratch it. It just looks awful and I want it to go away. Took him to the vet a week ago and they said it was some kind of skin infection. He was given two weeks of antibiotics but they don't seem like they've done anything so far. Today is actually the worst I've seen it.

I know he has pretty bad allergies; I've had him allergy tested and he's on a approved food. But he has a lot of environmental allergies that are mostly out of my control. To help combat that, he has been on Apoquel (1 pill, every other day) for about a year now. It seems that on days he takes his pill, the rash or whatever it is, isn't as bad. On the morning before he gets his pill (which is today) seems to be when the rash is at its worst.

Was the vet wrong about the infection? What they prescribed doesn't seem to be helping the redness. It ""seems"" to coincide with his allergies. I'm planning on getting him Cytopoint shots which hopefully helps. What do you think? Allergies? Something else? "	dogs

1121	[Help] My two dogs are suddenly uninterested in their food	"Hello, just putting this question out to see if anyone has had a similar issue that happened to both of their dogs at the same time. I'm not overly worried yet.

I have two 40-pound mini-Goldendoodles (3&amp;4 years old) that are well trained (partially because of their extreme love of food). Up until maybe 2 weeks ago, when I would say ""breakfast/dinnertime"" they would both go crazy and run to their bowls and patiently wait for it to be filled. Then when I would tell them to eat, they would eat right away and finish it all.

About 3 weeks ago, they both caught ""colds"" (I'm assuming from one day they spent in a trustworthy kennel that I've used before). They had runny noses and were sneezing a lot with occasional reverse-sneezing fits. They've been over those colds for about 2 weeks but have been uninterested in their food ever since (they've been eating various kinds of Blue Buffalo their whole lives). They have been eating one of their two daily meals on average. The annoying part is that they are still very much interested in dogs treats and human foods. I have been withholding all food except their Blue Buffalo for the past several days just as a test, but it hasn't changed anything. If I sit down with them to do tricks, they will eat the reward treat, but if I try to give them the Blue Buffalo as a reward, they will spit it out. I opened a new bag of Blue Buffalo of a different variety, but they are still uninterested. They usually go crazy if I add water to the food,but they don't care about that either now.

Yesterday, I didn't give them dinner, and didn't give them breakfast this morning. They had normal, playful energy throughout the day and their poop has been normal looking. I gave them dinner this evening, but they were still disinterested in it. One of them ate all of it, and the other laid down next to it for a few minutes, then ate about half of it. I can’t imagine they both just became picky eaters at the same time.

I'll probably take them to the vet in the next few days, but just wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience with both of their dogs at the same time. Thanks in advance."	dogs
1122	[Update] Should I surrender them?	"[I posted about a week ago asking if I should surrender my 2 dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/99qxm1/help_should_i_surrender_them/?utm_content=full_comments&amp;utm_medium=message&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) since they are basically crated for 20 hours a day on work days.

​

I have deleted that post, but I got a lot of very blunt (and a bit harsh) feedback from this community. I've  taken what was said to me and I really analysed the situation, and I've decided that surrendering them is the right choice. They deserve to go to a home that will smother them with love and attention.

​

They are going to a breed-specific rescue that has a very strict adoption process, so it's very very likely they'll go to a fantastic home. They are being picked up this Friday by their foster.

1124	[Discussion] Dog park drama. Am I in the wrong here?	"So I just posted this on Facebook, but I think you guys will give me some better insight into this. Maybe I'm somewhat in the wrong here or could have done better here. 

For context Zoey is a 4 year old Border Collie. Cooper is a 1.5 year old GSD/Husky. He had a GSD mix that was off the bat showing some not cool signs (came in with hair up, was growling as they sniffed, telling the  dog immediately to be nice) which is why I originally tried to get some distance. He also had some sort of lab mix that was not directly involved. 

Begin rant. 

Today I took Zoey and Cooper to the dog park. Zoey loves the park, but can also be SUPER possessive of toys (especially balls). Since this has been an issue in the past, and because the parks are literally covered in discarded toys, I kept both of them in the separate ""shy dog"" area until the main area cleared out. Once it was pty I brought both in and we hung out for a bit, until a man showed up with his two dogs. 

When he entered l the very first thing I said to him was ""she's not good with toys, she gets very possessive, just a warning to you and your dogs"" and he tells me his get like that too.  Hes trying to chit chat and follows me while I'm walking over to the other side of the park to get some distance and next thing I know he picks up a ball and starts throwing it around right in front of Zoey and his own two dogs.   

I have LITERALLY JUST SAID my dog is possessive. He LITERALLY JUST SAID his dog is also possessive. Can you guess what happened next? 

No dogs were hurt, but I'm still so upset at this. I don't know what possessed this man to just blatantly not listen to what I told him, and put both of our dogs at risk of injury. Of somebody tells you their dog has an issue like this please listen. 

If he had not followed me to the other side of the park and kept some distance everything would have been fine.

1126	[Help] Border Collie Puppy 12 weeks Pee Question	" 

Hello,

My girlfriend and I adopted a border collie mid last month. So far, we love our puppy, very smart! But I do have some questions about her peeing. When we take her out to pee, it seems like she does not want to pee everything out at once. Not sure if this is common for certain puppies, but our poodle, even at a young age, would pee everything out in one go. Our puppy collie could hold it for at least 3-4 hours if she wanted too, but it seems like she chooses not to. Couple things I am wondering if these are normal for collies:

1. She will pee for half a second outside, on the grass and won't go again unless we take her back outside in 20-30 minutes.
2. She only pees in one spot, our front lawn, no other grass areas, just that one spot.
3. Since she only pees in that one spot for a split second, she will not pee anywhere else even if we walk her for an hour (same with pooping)

We have given her so many treats and positive reinforcement when she pees outside, but the moment she steps back inside, she pees. Could be a span of 10 minutes or if lucky another hour. We have tried limiting her water, but same result. We do not want to constantly have a timer every 30 minutes to take her out to pee. I was told a 3 month old puppy could at least hold it for 2-3 hours. When shes in a kennel for 4 - 5 hours, she does not pee inside it. Any advice or tips how we can teach our collie to pee everything out at once?"	dogs
1127	[Help] How long did it take your dog to be come used to wearing a cone?	"My dog had foot surgery and has to wear a cone for about 3 weeks (unless I am in the same room watching him closely). I expected him to try and get it off, but it actually TERRIFIES him. I understand a lot of his vision is removed and it makes him uneasy. When I put the cone on him he doesnt move, and starts panting and drooling a little bit. Very very uncomfortable. Also, he has to have a rigid cone - a soft one isn't an option for him. I don't know that it would make a difference to him, though. 

I am trying not to be anxious about it even though I hate seeing him uncomfortable. Last night was awful, he didn't move all night long and just cried and cried. He tried to step on his bed but the edge of the cone caught it and he was too scared. I imagine he was uncomfortable all night because he was too scared to try and sleep in a normal position.

1131	[Help] Alternative to glucosamine for an allergic dog?	"I have a 9 year old yellow lab that has spinal arthritis, she's had it for at least 4 years and had been doing well on glucosamine enhanced dog food, as well as supplement tablets.

However recently she developed an allergy to glucosamine, and we can no longer give her either the food with it already in it or the tablets. She's been noticeably groaning every time she stretches or moves compared to before we stopped giving the glucosamine to her.

About a month or so ago she began licking various parts of her body raw, and we hadn't changed any of the foods that she was being given.

When we cut out the glucosamine, the licking completely stopped, so we figure she has developed a shellfish allergy in that time.

Is there an alternative product we can give her for her joints? When she was first diagnosed we were giving her aspirin via our vet's instructions and another prescribed painkiller, but both ended up resulting in her liver starting to show signs of damage so we had to discontinue those as well; They aren't an option for her, unfortunately.

1132	[Help] Submissive Urination	"I have a female 1 yr 9 month old Aussie who’s been with me for about 4 months now. From the day I’ve had her, she’s been peeing in the house with submissive urination. If I greet her when I come home, let her out of the kennel, try to pick her up, say hi to my other dog, tell her to “come here” at any random point in the day: her ears go back, she squats down, and pees puddles everywhere (sometimes she’ll just go on her back and pee). I’ve read all of the articles and videos on this issue and have adhered to the advice: never punishing or acknowledging the behavior, using obedience training, trying to redirect the triggers (although with her everything is a trigger), giving her an hour and a half of strenuous exercise at the park every day, etc

1133	[HELP] I have a dog who needs to be mentally stimulated and exercised, but absolutely refuses to walk or be outside for long. Any indoor/apartment safe toys or games?	"So I'm in a bit of a pickle. This is all in regards to a two year old Belgian Malinois. TL;DR at the end.

Last week, my husband and I adopted a dog from the Humane Society. She was a complete sweetheart, and they assured us that she was housebroken and hadn't barked other than once when a very agitated dog passed her kennel. They DID say she had a chewing problem, which I was ok with because my husband and I have both trained our fair share of dogs.

So, we take her home and she was great. She let us know when she needed to go out with a quiet bark, she was gentle and friendly to the other people she met in the apartment building, and most importantly she wasn't interested in the cats at all. She was also fine being left in her kennel for the 4 hours my husband and my work hours overlap. She went in of her own accord, chewed on her toys and was fine. Things seemed to be good.

But now she's feeling at home, and a flip has switched.

She has been jumping up on people when she greets them, barking, going after my cats, refuses to go in her kennel and will whine and bark. We live in an apartment building so this is a BIG issue. 

And the one that bothers me the most, she has started going to the bathroom inside in a willful fashion.

We take her out for bathroom breaks CONSTANTLY because we are still trying to show her the stairs aren't scary, outside is good etc. So she goes out at 7am (I leave for work) 9am, 11:30am (husband leaves for work) 2pm (I come home on my lunch break and then leave again) 5pm when I come home from work, and then I watch her and see if she gives any signs to go out during the evening before bed.

For the past several days, I will literally bring her upstairs after having been out (and she went!), and she will find a place and poop or pee. 

We spoke with the vet who saw her last week, and they assured us that she was healthy and would have nothing physically making her do this. They are saying that she is acting out because she's bored in the apartment. 

The problem is, she won't walk. She won't get further than maybe 50 feet from the door before she plants her legs and refuses. I would LOVE a walking buddy, we have great trails right next to our building and I was hoping for a dog who wanted to walk. I've tried treats, I've tried waiting her out, she won't budge. I've even tried just standing outside with her so she can sniff around, but she goes straight for the door. To clarify, there is a busy main door to the building, but we lucked out and are right next to a back door that no one seems to use ever, so we take her out there where it's quiet and there are no cars, people or dogs to frighten her. It leads out into the woods so there should be plenty of nice smells but she's not interested.

And as for the pooping/peeing, we were told to start kenneling her for about ten minutes after we get inside to differentiate that bathroom breaks happen outside, inside is for sleeping. But as I said, she will howl and bark and we don't want her to think we are letting her out because she whined enough.

My husband and I have had various shepherds and collies, so we're used to active breeds who need a lot of mental stimulation. We thought we could work this out with long walks and maybe an agility course once she's comfortable. But since she refuses to go outside for anything other than the bathroom, of course she's bored and acting out. 

We are going to continue working on getting her comfortable with walking, but in the meantime we need to make sure she doesn't destroy our apartment or get us in trouble with her barking.

Are there any puzzles, toys or games that will help her with mental stimulation? She's happy to play indoor fetch, but again we have apartment neighbors.

And just to clarify, my husband and I are not giving into her stubborn bids for the upper hand and we are disciplining her (not yelling but firmly letting her know) that barking, pooping, chasing cats etc. are not to be tolerated. Since she doesn't want to go outside, that gives us plenty of opportunity to train her on commands.

She also loves her Kong chew, bone stuffed with chicken, tug rope and tennis balls but we can only do so much with those inside.

**TL;DR: Adopted a dog that needs tons of exercise and mental stimulation, but refuses to leave our apartment. What toys/games/puzzles can I use to keep her entertained before she destroys everything?**

**EDIT:** We do not allow the dog out near the cats without supervision. The vet said a month or so of growing pains is to be expected, but we have discussed the possibility of what we need to do if she cannot get along with the cats after that period.

My one cat couldn't care less and stands up to the dog if she barks or tries anything, my other cat has been safely quarantined until the dog gets under control. He loves having a space to himself.


**EDIT 2:** We are 100% taking her to a positive trainer as soon as she is acclimated, I am just trying to lessen the indoor accidents and barking in the meantime."	dogs
1134	[help] my dog’s first time on a boat	I’m taking my dog out to a cabin on the lake and it’s gonna be his first time on a boat, so I’m kinda nervous about how he’ll react. Any tips on helping him stay calm would be much appreciated! Thanks!	dogs
1135	[Help] Accidentally came on my dog and he won't let me bathe him.	I could use a throwaway, but fuck it. My dog, a cocker spaniel mix, was lying down beside my bed and I didn't know he was there. Anyways I did the deed and accidentally nutted off the side of my bed and I looked down and saw it was all over him. He got up and bolted out his doggy door to the backyard where he has since been running around in. How do you get your dog to come back to you? I'll admit he's not the most trained dog, he's only 1 and a half, but I try. Do you have any tricks that will let me catch him? Thanks.	dogs
1136	[help] New to having a pet, worried about him when he goes potty...	Hello everyone, my puppy is about 13 weeks old. He’s really smart and learning to go potty but I’ve been worried about what’s happening when he does. Last week I took him to the vet and he got a shot and flea medicine and heartworm medicine. The vet called back and said he’s clean of parasites and stuff. My mom gave Brady (the pup) some chicken last night and he pooped later on in the house cause my brother wasn’t paying attention to take him out. I just took Brady out and he peed then pooped then kinda wiped his bottom on the grass and then walked around and went to poop like three or four more times but nothing really happened. There was like a mucus kinda stuff and I got a little worried. I told my brother about it and he said that Brady did the same thing early this morning when he took him out. Should I call the vet and tell them about this or wait it out and see if anything changes. We’re also try to get Brady to eat more hard food but I think he’s making himself not eat it cause he eats it so slowly. I wanna go back to just soft food but I’m unsure. 	dogs
1137	[Help] Eye infection not better with meds	Hi all, we've been to the vet TWICE now and are on the third round of new meds. I'm asking for help, not because I can't take him to the vet, but because I want to know if anyone else has experience with a seemingly resistant eye infection. His eye is squinty, discharge is coming out of it, and it's tearing. But, it does not seem to be itchy! The vet did mention the possibility of eye cancer, and going to a specialist, but I want to know if anyone has had an experience like this, or any insight into what it could be? Thanks. 	dogs
1138	[Discussion] Off-leashed and aggressive towards other dogs	"TLDR - little Shih Tzu terrorises our neighbourhood, owner refuses to leash it on walks and even picks it up and cradles it like a baby after it lunges at my dogs aggressively.

Hi all, 

I have 2 sweet dogs - a 3.5 year old Golden Retriever, and a 2.5 year old Goldendoodle. They get a little excited when out on walks but nothing I can't handle. They are friendly and affectionate 99.9% of the time (doodle might come off as a little aloof to humans sometimes) and all our neighbours love them. 

The problem is that one of our neighbour has a little Shih Tzu that is quite aggressive. My dogs have gotten charged at 3 times now, and the Shih Tzu usually likes to target my Golden specifically. Once after getting snapped in the face by the Shih Tzu, my Golden considers it to be her arch nemesis and she absolutely hates this dog. I usually turn around and walk the other way when I spot this Shih Tzu in the same park when we're out for walks. Nothing happens if the Shih Tzu fails to spot any dog, but if he does spot a dog, he starts barking and growling and lunging, and it triggers the other dog. I've heard of other neighbours getting attacked too, so it isn't just my dogs. 

Once, the Shih Tzu charged at my dogs and I leapt in front of my dogs to protect them. When the owner finally caught up to us, she picked it up, cradled it and started cooing at it in a baby voice saying, ""It's okay, you're okay. Don't be scared."" She offered no apology at all.

This morning during their morning walk, we ran into this Shih Tzu again. The thing about going to the park is that we use a shortcut to get to it. It's like a little alley about 13 - 16 ft, so when we're using the alley, we can't see if there's anything waiting for us at the end of the alley until we emerge from it. Just as we walked out of the alley, that little dog came barrelling towards us and we were caught off-guard. This time, I didn't have a chance to react and by the time it registered that this was the demon dog I usually avoid, there was already a fight going on. The owner was calling for their dog but that little Shih Tzu is untrained, has no discipline and didn't even turn its head to the sound of the owner calling it off. The owner came running and actually slipped and fell on the pavement. I have no sympathy at all. 

We managed to escape, and in my hurry to escape from the demon dog, I didn't confront the owner about their off-leashed terror. This is now the 4th time my dogs were attacked by this Shih Tzu. No injuries on my dogs as far as I can tell (my dogs seem extremely satisfied and happy after the fight though.). 

It is illegal in my country to have an unleashed dog and it can be reported to the authorities. I'm just wondering if I should go ahead to do it. I don't want to sour the relationship between neighbours. But I'm seriously thinking I should report them. 

The problem is that the owners don't think their dog is the problem. They cradle and coo it and treat it like a real baby. That dog has zero discipline at all. My dogs are bigger and most people have this idea that big dogs are aggressive and if a big dog and a small dog were in a fight, it is almost always the big dog's fault. It is so frustrating. 

Anyone met with this kind of situation as well? Any advice? All discussion are welcome. 

I shall include pictures of my dogs here if anyone wants to see:

1139	[VENT] Hug your dog, you never know what might happen	"This evening I took my 7 month old GSD pup to the apartment dog run. We had been there for about 10 minutes before another woman and her dog showed up. 

We'd been together in the dog park several times before, and our dogs got on well. The new dog was very active, sprinting around, having a great time.

About 10 minutes into the play session, the two dogs were chasing each other around at the far end of the dog run. The other dog made as if to turn, and then collapsed howling and screaming with pain.

At first myself and the other woman, the dogs owner, were both frozen. My dog had been a few steps behind the other dog and didn't seem to have touched her. What could have happened.

The dog continued to scream and we both snapped out of our shock and ran to her. I pulled my dog away, and tied him to a tree, then went back to help.

The woman was clearly panicing. Her dog was screaming, unable to stand. She seemed unable to move her back legs.

I tried to calm the woman down as best I could. I agreed to hold her dog still while she ran for her car. 

While she was gone I attempted to sooth the dog while also figure out what had happened. There were no visible signs of injury, however she appeared unable to use her back legs. I attempted to splay her toes, but got no response from the dog. Lifting and dropping her tail also elicited no response. When I ran my hand down her spin, I could feel a small bump. Almost a deviation of the spine not far from the base of her tail.

I would guess that I sat holding the dog for about 10 minutes, although it felt longer.

When the woman returned I helped her get the dog into her car. I didn't know what to do. I had my own dog to think of, still tied to the tree, but wanted to offer to drive her to the vet. The woman seemed on the verge of total panic. Instead, I just asked what I could do to help her. 

She said she was okay to drive and was going to get to the vet as soon as possible. I nodded and let her go. I didn't know what else to do.

All I can think of is the sound that woman made when her dog collapsed and she realized something was terribly wrong. 

All that woman wanted to do was spend sometime playing with her dog in the park after a long day of work. Now she's at the vet, dealing with what I can only hope is temporary paralysis.

I hope the dog is okay.

Hug your dogs people. Things happen so quickly.

1141	[Breeds] Looking for suggestions	"Love this questionnaire! My husband and I are looking to add to our family and would love some suggestions. I've pointed out what we are leaning towards, but I've never had a dog before so I've love some more opinions. 

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be our first dog, we’ve had cats up until now. I’ve dog sat most of my friends dogs at some point or another, border collie mixes, goldens, Brittany spaniel, Springer spaniel, lab, bichon, etc

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Kind of cat like, lazy to a degree, independent but still wants to be with their people

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Greyhound has been at the top of our list because of their personality and activity level, 45 mph couch potato. I think we could be open to other breed types. I want a larger dog, something 35+ pounds. I love our friends’ Brittany spaniel but our other friends have a Brittany/springer that’s a spaz that I’m not a huge fan of, tho my husband likes him, he’s a cuddler once he calms down. My husband also loves bulldogs, but I hate how stubborn they can be, and they have a drooling problem. I also like a well-trained lab (extended family has one) as well. My aunt has had a dalmatian (it was older and I really liked it when I was a kid), beagle (not a fan) and other family members had small white dogs (maybe a bichon) that I hated too. I think I didn't like them because of their lack of training tho. My grandfather had a mix that was the sweetest. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The normal, sit, wait, to walk on a leash without pulling, not to jump on people, etc. Nothing too serious, mostly just basic stuff.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Several Hours? Not sure how much or how little I should devote to this, coming from the cat world. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Walks mostly, greys don’t do well in dog parks which is what I’ve pretty much based all my opinions on thus far. I’d say 1 – 1.5 hours total of walking. I work at home so going out a couple times a day is no problem. I did find some active greyhound groups for group meetups. One meets at an indoor enclosed equestrian center and has a lure setup for some running if they wanted which is totally neat. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Regular brushing is no problem, cleaning ears is cool, but the rest I’d want to pay someone. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Larger, 35+ pounds. I want a dog that’s a dog, can’t be smaller than my cats and nothing yippy which I tend to associate with the smaller toy breed groups anyway. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine (read again, cats), low barking and low slobber would be ideal

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. I suppose it would be nice, but really anywhere we’d go, laws require a leashed dog and I hate it when I’m hiking or something and a random unleashed dog walks up to me. I don’t know if they are friendly or not. I would not exposure others to that. I would prefer that they would at least be good at recalling back to me if for some reason they got loose accidentally or spooked at something. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I’d prefer personal space, my husband would prefer snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* In the middle? Eager to please seems like they’d need attention ALL. THE. TIME. And I don’t have that in me, but I would like them to enjoy being with me. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Leary but not scared about it. I would be fine with barking at door knocks/door bell ringing, but not at every single thing that moves outside.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d rather not, all my friends have dogs and they run the spectrum on their ability to interact with other dogs. I’d want one who was good with them, we live in a very dog friendly city so we’d prob take the dog out with us a lot if they could handle it, so people and other dog friendly would be perfect. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing that training couldn’t correct (do not jump on people, my #1 pet peeve)

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Rarely, a couple hours a day, both my husband &amp; I work at home, but go out to dinner regularly and run errands after work. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband pretty much agrees with me unless I highlighted something above, we will both be the primary caretakers of the pets. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, 2 cats. Our cat of 14 years recently passed away and we’re ready to add to our family again. We wouldn’t add a dog to her family because she’d been alone with us for 12.5 of her 14 years and that would have been unfair to her, but we’ve been thinking about it for years now. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No. Yuck. Children.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent now, but are buying a house in the next 6 months, currently we’re not allow the “standard” aggressive breeds, pit-bulls, akitas, etc.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* None that I’m aware of currently. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* I live in North Carolina, so highs are in the high 80s during the summer months and lows are in the 30s in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Being okay with cats is pretty important to me, we don’t have the cats yet, was thinking getting the dog first would be ideal so we can train him/her beforehand and the interactions with the addition of cats would be less stressful for all involved. Thoughts on this?

1142	[Help] Fostering an emaciated, very pregnant street dog.	"Hello r/dogs, I could use some advice. I work for an animal shelter/hospital, and we recently got in a very timid, matted dog. An hour into her shave down, I realized how skinny she is, and then realized how pregnant she is!

 She's terrified of people but shows no aggression, and seems to enjoy being pet once she relaxes a bit. I decided to foster her not only to socialize her, but to make sure she isn't so stressed and alone during the pregnancy.

She's basically about to burst, and I'm concerned about how skinny and malnourished she is. I'm afraid for the health of her and the puppies. Does anybody know a safe and healthy way for her to put on weight quickly? Also, any other tips (socialization, birth, etc.) are very appreciated.

(She is about 5 years old, obviously unaltered and malnourished. We don't know anything about her other than she was found on the street, and someone managed to catch her and bring her in.)"	dogs
1143	[Help] How many calories?	I'm thinking like ~550 for my 20 lb senior. He eats canned, so depending on calories in a can, about 1.5 cans a day. This sound right? I'm concerned I am underfeeding him.	dogs
1144	[help]Dog ownership after a breakup	"I submitted a post awhile ago about me and my GF breaking up and how to deal with the dog and I thought I'd give a small update for and I had a few more questions which if you want you can just skip down and read. If this is against the rules I apologise.

So without getting to deep into it, my ex cheated on me and left me but long before that we had gotten a dog together. Naturally we got pretty heated talking about who was going to take the dog and even almost went to court. Thankfully we eventually settled on me keeping the dog.. almost. 

I own the house we lived in, it's the house Vi (the dog) has grown up in, I have a fenced in back yard and 14 miles of trail to explore. She now lived in a duplex in the middle of a city that doesn't allow dogs, but she is cheating the system as they allow you to have service dogs, but she has a doctor's note for a comfort animal and I'm not sure her landlord knows the difference and she has also gotten a new puppy. The arrangement now is every so often I would meet her at a dog park and she can play with the dog for a few hours. It is my fondest hope that she eventually moves on and gives up on this but still every now and again brings up how she ""could have taken me to court and gotten the dog back weeks ago"". I think the odds of me winning in court are 99 to 1 as I have a notarized bill of sale for the dog as well as the state registration. 

 For me the only thing that sucks with with me keeping her is I work 8 hours with a 45 min commute to and from work. Most days a buddy who lives down the street from me is coming over most days and letting her out to potty but there are 1 or 2 days where I have no choice but to leave her home for 10 hours. I live out in the middle of nowhere so there isn't any dog walkers so I'm hosed there, I can't afford doggy daycare.

 So far on those days she has done fine, I have a camera in the house so I can check on her and all she does pretty much the entire time I'm gone is chill out on the couch with the cat. So that leads me to my questions.

1. How bad is it to leave her alone for that long? I'm working on a permanent solution, and in a year or so am planning to move closer to work but for right now I don't have a ton of options. 

2. How long does it take for me taking care of the dog by myself til she has no more grounds to dispute the dog, all she had is the Doctor's note and she handled the vet bills which I have since took over. After she broke up with me she had moved out into her new place in less then a week and I have been taking care of the dog for almost 2 months now."	dogs
1145	[Help] Dogsitting a Vocal Frenchie	"Hi there. I'm currently 5 days into 15 days of dog sitting my friend's french bulldog while he's on holiday abroad. I'm (of course) a huge dog lover, and after having both my fur babies pass away this year I was excited to have a dog in the house again for a while. However so far I've found it quite difficult.
The dogs I've raised in the past have all been terrier breeds and I understand Frenchies have much different personalities. But I also know that my friend hasn't focused on training her since she was a small puppy (she's about 11 months now). The dog is used to going potty indoors, but I live in a rented apartment with carpet so I'm letting her outside constantly - there's only been one accident so far. 
But the major thing is she's VERY vocal, and I'm afraid it's going to upset my neighbours (we have thin walls). She whines constantly. Now, I have been walking her twice a day (double what she's used to getting usually), feed her on a schedule, give her plenty of toys, lots of attention and petting, brushed everyday - but still she whines and does the squeaky bark, usually at the door or at me.

I have fostered two dogs with separation anxiety before, and I don't believe this is what she's experiencing. If she whines at the door, I assume she needs to use the potty so I let her outside. About 15% of the time it is for that reason, but the other times she just stands out there and sniffs/snorts or barks. Like I said I live in a rented apartment, and the garden area is not secure enough for me to let her roam out there on her own. 
I don't want to be too strict with her as I know she will be going back to her home where there are few rules, but I want to know if there's a way I can teach her to be a bit quieter?  

Any help would be appreciated please!"	dogs
1146	[Link] Livestock guardian dogs ease Namibia's cheetah-farmer conflicts	"[Article](https://phys.org/news/2013-08-dogs-ease-namibia-cheetah-farmer-conflicts.html) and [South African](http://www.cheetah.co.za/an_project.html) group.


Cheetah conservationists encouraging the use of LGD among African farmers, seems to be going pretty well. I haven't seen any articles about this in the sub and thought it was neat. :)

&gt;The dogs are placed with a flock when a few weeks old to bond with the livestock. They live permanently with the animals, loyally heading out with them every day to deter hunters, and bedding down with them at night.

&gt;Marker's centre started breeding the livestock dogs to promote cheetah-friendly farming after some 10,000 big cats—the current total worldwide population—were killed or moved off farms in the 1980s.

&gt;Up to 1,000 cheetahs were being killed a year, mostly by farmers who saw them as livestock killers.

&gt;But the use of dogs has slashed losses for sheep and goat farmers and led to less retaliation against the vulnerable cheetah.

&gt;We see about 80 to 100 percent decrease of livestock loss from any predator when the farmers have the dogs,"" said Marker.

&gt;In the last 19 years, around 450 dogs have been placed with farmers and more than 3,000 farmers trained."	dogs
1147	[Breeds] ANCD's? What are they and how do i get my hands on one?	"I saw this beautiful dog while researching today. His/her name is Yarrow and apparently it is an ANCD (Alaskan Noble Companion Dog). I've always wanted a med/large dog with that build and solid black color. Where do I get them? After looking online it's almost as if it doesn't even exist. 

Being in Arizona, I'm sure it makes it all the more difficult. What kind of dogs are similar to this? It fits the description of a 'wolf-looking' dog with a solid black coat that I've been looking for, for a very long time. 

Any advice helps. "	dogs

1150	[Fluff] My dog is home and healthy after being hospitalized for 2 days. We are so relieved.	"My 3 yr lab/mix Clyde has chronic pancreatitis.  It flares up every so often.  He's on a prescription diet and is never allowed human food.  This weekend my wife and I were at a friend's house catching up with some friends we haven't seen in a while.  Their back yard is fenced in and we let Clyde roam free. He was in eye sight the whole time and was generally well behaved.  We think his pancreatitis was flaring up because he started to eat grass and leaves, which he usually does when it flares up.  This time, he ate leaves from a fig tree.  I was able to stop him after he ate a few and didn't think anything of it.  About 30 minutes later he comes over to me and throws them up.  That was a sign that something was wrong.  We asked our friends what kind of tree it was and they told us fig tree.  We left their house, got into the car and googled if fig tree leaves are toxic for dog - they are.  Aside from throwing them up, he seemed fine (energy was normal, no diarrhea, etc.)  

It was Sunday and our vet was closed so we called a sister vet that was 24 hours.  They said bring him in and we made an appointment. On the way there, we got a flat tire which added about 10 minutes to the trip.  We got him to the vet, they did an exam and ran blood work.  The blood work came back with very high lipase levels, a sign his pancreas was in trouble.  Some liver enzymes were also off because of the toxicity.  They gave him charcoal to absorb the remaining toxins that he didn't throw up and wanted to admit him given his high lipase levels. The vet was very direct (and cold) with us and said it could be fatal because it wasn't his first flare up and the enzyme levels were really high.  We agreed to admit him and have him stay for a few days. We left terrified that we would never see our sweet boy again.  

We visited him the next day (Monday) and he seemed a lot worse. He appeared depressed.  He didn't wag his tail when he saw us, had no energy, didn't care that there were squirrels outside (a huge sign), and wasn't eating.  We visited for an hour and tried our best to get him to do anything.  Nothing worked.  We left feeling worse than the day before and couldn't stop crying.  We called our regular vet who reassured us that he would be involved and in contact with the sister vet office everyday.  The next morning (Tuesday) we got a call from the overnight vet saying that Clyde had improved and he would be ready to come home that night.  They told us after we left the first night, he wouldn't stop whining and trying to get out of his kennel.  They told us his demeanor changed as soon as we left, he was energetic, and they thought it was him just wanting to go home with us (who knows the real reason).  That day they transitioned him off of IV fluids and he ate two meals and was able to go to the bathroom.  We picked him up Tuesday night and we had our normal, happy, energetic pup back.  We took him to the pet store to pick out a new toy and went home.  It's been one day and everything seems back to normal.  

It's hard to describe that feeling while he was gone for 2 days.  Our house felt so empty and there are thousands of things that reminded me that he wasn't there.  Things that I didn't expect to remind me he wasn't there and also didn't expect each of them to hit me like a truck.  Like walking from my kitchen to the living room and turning the corner to see his toys on the floor just sitting there, or leaving for work and having to unlock the door, when I usually unlock it when I take him on our early morning walk; I just stood there and stared at the lock for what seemed like an eternity.  My heart felt so empty.  But he's back now and everything is normal and we are relieved.  

&amp;#x200B;

As a final note, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the staff that took care of him, especially two vet techs, Danielle and Lauren.  That office was so busy that day and they were so positive and supportive, and they did not rush us at all.  

Thanks for reading. I had to share. I'm going to take Clyde out for a walk now. Cheers!

1151	[Help] Anyone know how to teach a dog to like the pool?	I have an almost 2 year old spoo who is not interested in jumping in the pool. Our pool does not have a gate around it, however she is always supervised when she's outside. She fell in a few weeks ago and panicked. While we were able to coax her to the steps to get out, I really want her to get comfortable in the water so if she ever falls in she can easily get out. Any ideas on getting her to like being in the pool? Or at least tolerate it? I have tried getting in the pool and offering her treats or treating when she gets close to the water. I have also tried putting her on a leash and giving treats while I tried to get her to walk on the steps with me and no luck. She will get into the ocean to grab a ball, but no luck with the pool. If the ball gets in the pool she will lay by it until someone gets it for her. Anyone had any luck getting their dog in? 	dogs
1152	[HELP] Asked to trim my Border Collie but the groomer shaved it. What do I do?	"Edit: shaved him\*\*

Pretty much the title. I have an almost 3 old border Collie (Milo) and I wanted to trim his fur so I went to a groomer, but they shaved him instead of trimming him. I am not sure whether it was my fault or theirs, but it doesn't really matter to me anymore because I just read about double coat shaving and everything I read did not look positive at all so I am freaking out a bit.

Is there anything I can do to help Milo's double coat grow back as best as possible? Fish oil capsules, special food, brushing, etc.?

I have three cocker spaniels. Two boys, one girl. The female one destroys everything. They are very rarely left alone. But the female dog destroys everything. She has thus far eaten a hole in the wall, torn up the carpet, chewed up baby toys, shoes, books, the lot. We have tried everything - the adaptil plug in seemed to be working but now it seems not.

1154	[Help] Next door neighbor leaving gorgeous dog outside 24/7 in the desert!	"So, first time poster here, please forgive me if I’m in the wrong place! 

Recently I moved into a new house that my sister and her boyfriend bought, during the time that we’ve been here, we’ve noticed our next door neighbor leaves his pup outside all day and all night. He can’t be more than ten months old, and he’s a Husky/Shepherd mix. He’s big, he’s friendly, he’s one of the sweetest dogs I’ve ever met, and we live in the desert where 115 degree days are not uncommon. The owner of the dog from what I understand is a police officer as well. We’ve called some local shelters and even the city for advice, and considering he’s ‘doing the bare minimum’ he isn’t breaking any laws. In my area, said bare minimum consists of water and an area of shade, which is a non air conditioned dog house. The dog gets maybe twenty to thirty minutes of actual attention a day, but otherwise he’s left completely neglected on his own. If at all possible I would love to somehow get ahold of the dog, but at this point I just want a solution to help get him away from this guy who clearly doesn’t understand what he signed up for when getting a dog. Every time we head outside and he sees us, he bolts towards the chain link fence separating our properties, barking and whining, clearly desperate for attention from anyone at this point. We’re looking for any ideas or suggestions on this, we’ve tried talking to the man himself but our cries fell on deaf ears. "	dogs
1155	[Help] Bear has been sick for over 2 weeks and he doesn’t seem to be getting better.	My dog and I flew from Portland, OR to Massachusetts a little over a month ago. He was fine for the first two weeks but then developed a dry cough. That lasted 2 days before I took him to the vet where he was prescribed a cough suppressant and doxycycline 200mg BID. I waited another two days before starting the abx. The cough suppressant worked but it wasn’t completely cleared. 2 days into the doxy he stopped coughing but became increasingly lethargic and started refusing food. He’s usually incredibly food oriented so this was far from normal. That was about 10 days ago and he still will only eat a very small amount of people food (he normally eats a high quality dog food).  I had his blood tested today and his BUN and potassium were mildly elevated, that’s it. Anybody out there with any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. He’s already lost 4 pounds. 	dogs
1156	[Discussion] Letting my close friend take my dog to agility classes?	"I want to sign my dog up for agility classes because I think she'd LOVE it. The only problem is all the classes I can find in my area are during the day, during the week, while I'm at work.

My dog is great friends with my best friend who she sees every single day already (we live next door to each other) and he is available during the day and would be willing to take her to classes for me.

I think it would be good for both of them, my dog for obvious reasons, and him because he's kind of a shut-in, so he'd get out more. My only hesitations are probably selfish. I'm jealous of the bonding they would inevitably share and I wonder if my dog would take any of that training home with her and let me do it too? Also would the trainer look at me like I have two heads if I explained she's MY dog, but my friend is going to be training her? It seems weird.

Ideally, I'd love to take her myself. But unless I can change my work schedule or find weekend classes it doesn't look like it's going to happen. What do you guys think? Is there any good reason not to let him take her to classes since I can't?"	dogs
1157	[Breeds] First-time Owner from Australia, which breeds would be good for me?	"\*\*Introduction\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* This will be my first dog, I have no experience training/owning dogs. I've interacted with friends dog's and dogs in the parks/streets and I'd say I'm pretty comfortable around them.

&amp;#x200B;

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?

&amp;#x200B;

\* If I can find a dog that suits me in a pound, I'm open to the idea of rescuing. If not, through a breeder is also an option 

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* A dog that that I can go running around with at parks, but is also comfortable being at a home with no backyard for \~8hrs on weekdays. A cute dog would be a huge bonus too! (My family would be more inclined to help take care of it haha). A low maintenance dog would be ideal (not too much shedding), i.e. one that only needs to be groomed once a week/once every 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Golden retriever/Aussie Shepherd/Border collies are ones I like to imagine running around with parks and stuff (theres quite a few dog-friendly parks in my area which sort of makes up for the my lack of a backyard). But smaller dogs like Pomeranians/Terriers also seem really cool!!

&amp;#x200B;

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Catch, roll over, play dead, simple stuff like that is fine! Doesn't have to be able to jump through hoops, don't need a show dog haha

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* 6 hrs (\~5hrs of passive interaction at home, \~1hr of active physical activity, e.g. walks, runs). Would do more active activity on weekends (runs/hikes)

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* About 1hr of active exercise a weekday (walks/runs) around parks and the block. Weekends \~2hrs a day, maybe hitting up a dog park every now and then

&amp;#x200B;

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd be happy to brush my dog once a week or maybe once every 2 weeks. Trimming hair and cleaning ears, maybe once a month (is that about average?) Wouldn't mind paying a dog groomer once a month or so.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Up to about 1-1.5 metres (40-60inches)

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Would be ok with a little bit of shedding, barking (not too loud to be a constant nuisance to neighbours and such) and slobber.

&amp;#x200B;

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd like to be able to let my dog off the leash every now and then (so probably wouldn't want any aggressive-type dogs)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Preferably a snuggly dog, or a little bit in between (but my family and I would want one that is happy to be picked up every now and then)

&amp;#x200B;

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* More eager to please, but not TOO hyper (ideally trainable enough to know when its ok to be hyper haha)

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Maybe some barking too make any possible home intruders think twice, but friendly enough to treat familiar faces (friends and family) nicely!!

&amp;#x200B;

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd prefer a dog that isn't aggressive to other dogs and people from the get-go.

&amp;#x200B;

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

&amp;#x200B;

\* The dog would be left at home when my family and I are out at Uni/Work (\~7-8hrs a day)

&amp;#x200B;

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Everyone in my family is fine with dogs, as long as they aren't too intrusive or too much of a nuisance (i.e. shedding/peeing on their bed, barking uncontrollably etc)

&amp;#x200B;

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

&amp;#x200B;

\* We currently have a guinea pig that is kept in a cage. But we would be able to keep it safely away from the dog if necessary. Not planning to get any other animals after getting a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Maybe at parks with random kids, and also younger family friends etc. (Everyone in my household is 18+)

&amp;#x200B;

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Not planning to rent

&amp;#x200B;

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

""dogo Argentino; fila Brasileiro; Japanese tosa; American pit bull terrier (or pit bull terrier); and Perro de Presa Canario"" are required to be muzzled etc. Not looking to getting any of these aggressive-type dogs though anyway.

1159	[Help] Dog Infested with Parasite - Need Help with Identification!	"**Clarification: As the treatment works really well (\~70%-80% dead within 2 day) I just need the type of parasite (it's probably some kine of mite). The reason is to match the treatment against the reproductions cycle, so i know how long I have to continue!**

Hello to all dog lovers out there. Sadly my first post isn't that fine at all - okay maybe a little ;)

The reason why I post here is my 17 years old dog. Overall he is a fit one with no larger problems, but a short time ago he wasn't as active as usual  - shortly after he began to smell differently and as I checked him I found a kind of 'parasite' - a lot actually. The image of the nose, is just the tip of the iceberg.

At first I thought he became a little incontinent and looses some feces at the balcony, but actually it was from the rubbing of his chin at the ground....

**Could someone tell me what these here are?** (sadly I can't upload a picture here at reddit?)

[dog\_parasites.jpg](https://postimg.cc/image/jbrvtf05j/)

After I treated him with baths and sound scrub downs with card soap, giving a tea spoon apple vinegar into his water (changing blood ph and smell a small amount, as this sometimes is for blood suckers a nogo and they will retreat) and cleaning his ears/body parts with a mixture made of equal amounts of appel vinegar, water and hydrogen peroxide 3%, these little beasts start to fall of and a lot have died already. But some always come back to ears and nose.

Ok at least he is now more active and starts to recover a little bit.

**So, which kind of parasite is this?**

1160	[Discussion] Off leash dogs	"What do you do when an off leash dog runs up to yours?

I live in a bad neighborhood, which lately means a lot of dogs not being cared for properly. I have a small cavachon who is very friendly and always wants to meet new dogs, but if they sniff at her neck it’s like a trigger and she’ll growl or snap at them. With some dogs they’ll just back off after that, but I don’t know that ALL dogs will react like that. And if it’s a stray dog off leash, no ones there to pull them back if they attack. 

I know I need to try to train her out of that, but when she was really young she got attacked during a puppy class by another dog that pinned her on her back and went for her neck, so I think she’s just skittish about that area.

What are some ways to keep strays back? Air horns? I’m just at a loss and I want to keep walking our mile or two a day without worrying that I’ll lose my best friend. "	dogs

1165	[HELP] My buddy STINKS	"I've got a large, *enthusiastic* Long Haired German Shepherd (~5yo). He has a strong sour smell - so strong that it lingers in the places he's been laying. Our vet only gave an explanation, but not any type of solution for his stank (spoiler alert: he's excited). Basically, he excretes a small amount of anal fluid when he's excited (e.g. when he knows we're driving to the park or leaving on a hike). Since these are frequent activities for us, the smell seems to be constant. 

It does go away temporarily after he's groomed, but it's a temporary fix. Every groomer we've been to has said there's not much to ""excrete"" when he's being groomed. He has long hair around his haunches, and being in water seems to make it worse (but I wouldn't dream of depriving this fish of his water).

1166	[Breeds]Breed recommendations/general recommendations for a dog living with a rabbit?	"So, I'm a dog person, my girlfriend is a rabbit person. We've got to learn how to merge our two biggest loves! Currently she has a rabbit and I have no dog, but I'm looking to get another in the next few years. I'm looking for a breed with a low prey drive who won't try to hurt the rabbit.

&amp;#x200B;

The rabbit has her own hutch and attached play area, but I'm hoping for a dog with a lower prey drive who won't be interested in trying to break into the hutch. (Even if the hutch is secure, rabbits are very sensitive creatures, and I don't want a dog that will bark at it all day and stress it out.) The rabbit hutch is in the living room, where we spend most of our down time (rabbits are very social like dogs and need a lot of time to bond with their humans, so I don't think moving the rabbit to a different, secured-off room is an option). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering if anyone has advice on what kind of dog to look for, as well as tips on socializing. For example, would it make more sense to get a puppy so that I can socialize it with the rabbit from a young age? Or would it make sense to get an adult so I know its temperament? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a summary of some of my desires for the dog:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Low prey drive, won't bark too much at the rabbit or try to hurt it.
2. Generally healthy breed or mutt--no brachycephalics.
3. Size is flexible. We have a two-story home with a very large yard. I'm picturing a small dog would be safer with the rabbit, but I love big dogs too. Medium exercise needs.
4. Age is flexible, but I do want a dog that's at least somewhat active and trainable, not an extremely low-energy senior dog.
5. Would prefer a dog that is friendly with all humans and animals. My last dog was a rescue and had severe dog aggression and fear reactivity toward humans due to a history of abuse. Loved her like crazy and worked with her for her whole life, but those traits were a big headache and difficult with my (social) lifestyle.

I'm open to shelter dogs and purebreds alike, but I'd love to hear if anyone has any tips. Thanks in advance!"	dogs
1167	[discussion] PSA: sending a dog to a farm doesn't magically solve separation anxiety, reactivity, or destructive boredom, BTW. It's about the new owners, not how much space they have.	" 

Farmer here. We adopted a dog that ""needed to be on a farm"" for her separation anxiety and want for exercise. Now, I'm not from this rural area, and I went in balls-to-the-walls with research on SA, expensive products, and a written-down strategy. We have an agility course, go on morning walks/bike rides down the dirt road, and practice obedience and nose games daily. We're trying to find her a job on the farm. Improvement is slow, but happening.

The neighbours are confused and on the regular tell me most people here would have shot the dog already. I'm ""making them look bad"" by walking my dog because their's just loaf on the porch, hang out on a chain, or chase cars all day. If we didn't plan things for her to do, my dog's life would consist of following us to a chore, then laying down while we work -- and we're busy.

Point being, the life of a farm dog in reality contains no more stimulation, therapy, exercise, or help than what the farm-people put into it. Surprisingly, dogs don't really go exploring too far on their own, they don't know they need to run around to feel good, and they won't find their own purpose unless put to work."	dogs

1169	[Breeds] Help me choose between Rottweiler or Leonberger, other breed maybe?	"Can someone educated enough in these two breeds too help me decide? Or maybe a different breed?

The reason I decided on these two is due to medical stuff (non-physical) a dog in my life is something that I've been wanting as a friend &amp; companion very badly. Im looking for a large dog that has a calm and friendly composure, can be independent and left for 4-8hrs if needed, sociable and can be brought in public (I realize this is heavily dependent on the dogs raising) , and can adapt to a small living space for a few months (not long term). It would not be my first experience with dogs, as i grew up with 4 of them and 2 are still alive (husky, golden retriever, black lab, poodle).  From what people have told me is that they are both very kind, gentle, and loving dogs that are not overly hyper and can adapt too apartment life pretty easily if needed(I have college for a semester) which is basically what im looking for. Also, as for large dogs their drooling is not as bad as a newfoundland per say, from what i've been told.  The upfront cost of the puppy is a non issue too me but, what breed is in general a healthier dog as im curious as too what to expect with vet bills and feeding?  I live in a cold area as well, can hit -30 without wind chill, so that is a factor, but not a huge one. Im not looking for a overly hyper dog either, but I do have the ability to give the dog 1-2 hours of activity a day and take it on day/weekend hikes or camping regularly. Shedding is not that huge of an issue too me either, but how bad do leonbergers shed? Is it very bad if combed/maintained almost daily? Any insight on either breed is very much appreciated. And if you think their are better dogs that would fit my situation I would love to hear your thoughts and if you think I should avoid these breeds altogether then please fill me in on why! Thanks!"	dogs
1170	[help] is this okay to do with my puppy?	I have an Australian Shepherd. He’s a little over 3 months. Since I’ve had him, he’s probably spent a total of 6 hours alone.

I’m probably going to move away next year. Should I get him more used to being alone in his crate during the day? Say I go to the store, I’ll crate him. Usually he goes with me everywhere. I’m just scared when I do leave him alone next year when he’s older, he’s totally going to freak out. 	dogs

The thing that botters me is that I think my first dog would hate me and be jelaous. My dog right now gets all the love and attention. The time I spend with dog playing right now wouldn't be halfed, food wouldnt be shared but doubled. But my dog probably wouldnt think about it this way. Im affraid my dog would be jelaous because there is suddenly another dog I'm taking care of, another dog I'm playing with.. another dog to share room with.

 
 &amp;nbsp;

I prob sound little bit crazy here and many of u prob see this as exaggerating, but u know what, maybe ur not wrong... I just love my dog so much

 &amp;nbsp;
 

Someone will prob be wonering, why do I even need 2 dogs..... I can't specifically answer that. I had desire to get one more dog for years now. I would actually like to get this idea of getting another dog out of my head but I can't.  

 &amp;nbsp;

Your oppinons on this sh*t? Has anyone been in this dilema? Did anyone get another dog? How did older one react?

1172	[Help] How do I register my dog as an emotional support animal?	"First time poster on this sub! If I made any mistakes with posting please let me know.

I have been searching for a way to get my Aussie Collie registered to be my emotional support animal (general anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder) for a little while now, and it seemed easy at first since there were several sites that offered “packages” that give your dog the certification as an emotional support animal.

...but I don’t know if it’s just me but the sites look a little sketchy, and I’m not sure that I can trust them. Is there any way to perhaps do it through the state or something? Are the sites that come up from a Google search legitimate? I am pretty clueless on the subject so any information would be greatly appreciated. "	dogs
1173	[Discussion] What Happened to the Australian Labradoodle? A new breed club takes a look into the Labradoodle's muddied past (Link in description).	"Often when discussing doodles in this sub the only reputable source we often refer to are Australian Labradoodles, who were originally developed for service and assistant work. As a sub overall we have scoured the internet to attempt to find reputable doodle breeders and found it very very difficult. Australian Labradoodles are rare, but it is looking like the only reputable doodle source is taking a different turn and renaming themselves entirely. Linked below is the breed club website for the Australian Cobberdog (what used to be the Australian Labradoodle) and their explanation of why it is time to distance themselves from the doodle name.

1174	[Help] Dont want to go to college without my dog	"I’m 16 now and live in a place where we aren’t allowed to have dogs but my therapist wrote me like a note/form saying it would help my mental health and it definitely has but there’s a problem. I’m leaving to college in two years and whenever I think about it without my dog I don’t want to go at all which sucks because I’ll be the first in my family to go and college has always been my dream. 

I don’t even have sleepovers anymore at other people’s house because I usually miss my dog and get anxiety. When I’m not in school I spend most of my time with him, whether it’s sleeping or taking him to the park, etc. I know everyone will say that it’s going to be too much of a responsibility but I take care of him now. 

I wake up and walk him to my school and then my mom picks him up and takes him home and I get home 5 hours later and then we go on a walk or to the park for 2 hours and at night I do another one hour walk. I know I won’t have this much time in college with all the homework but I’ll hire a dog walker or I’m willing to cut back on my social time with friends for him. 

I’m also nervous about leaving him with my parents because he’s a high energy dog and they probably won’t be able to take him out as much and give him the time he needs. I’m sure that he’ll do fine with an hour of exercise a day but I just get so nervous and sad when I think about the fact that he won’t be with me. He’s honestly the reason I haven’t tried to kill myself yet. "	dogs

1177	[Help] Doggo has back pain, not sure how to help her.	"Just a little bit about my situation, and I am curious how others have dealt with similar issues. 

We just had a new addition to our family, baby boy, and so things have been a little stressful for us and our 2 doggos. Last Sunday our 2 doggos were playing as they normally do. Well the baby started crying, we all got up to change the diaper. Come to find out my Jack Russell - Bischon mix, who turned 6 this year, was a little hunched over and shaking from pain. We Monitor her for a few hours, it seems to subside, we go to bed (never asleep with a new born) and she comes up and starts licking me all over the place, asking for help. So I take her to the emergency vet down the way.

This whole time she had been walking normally, just shaking. I thought we had gastrointestinal issues, or issues with her stealing a lock of oil from my blooming onion plate. We get to the emergency room, me in tears of course, and they take her back and diagnose her with a back issue, either a skipped disk or muscular pain. Oddly enough, she had this exact same issue last year when we got back from a week in Cancun. Almost to the day kinda odd. 

Anyways, they take her back again, and give her a shot of methadone for the pain. And send me home with some Rimadyl and Gabbapentine. As we are walking out her gait starts waiving, like her legs are numb. They said it was probably because of the shot, and should only last 6-8 hours. The affirmed that the shot was in the muscle around the tense part of her back. 

We get home, ""sleep"" fine. She was being a little rowdy, her legs still seem like they are giving her issues, like she cannot use them correctly. She will have spurts where she is completely fine for 5-6 steps then goes back to it. If she wants to take after something she seems to have full control over her back legs. She busted off once and I had to get some sedatives from our normal vet, so she can be more sedentary, which has worked great so the past 2 days. Not much movement but going out side. We are all a little bed ridden to even do anything active with the newborn. 

Anyways, to me this sounds like it could be an issue with a slipped disk as she has not gotten any better. Unless the methadone is still in her system? The vet said to give it a few weeks, but my heart is in pain watching her go through this. My anxiety is telling me it will be a $5k surgery, which we just cannot do: I want to, I want to so bad. But I don't know. I'm kinda freaking out because of the possibilities, and the numbness in her hindlegs seems to be about the same. 


Tldr; Jack Russell mix has back pain and minimal use of legs. I'm freaking out cause it's my baby girl. I don't have any idea what to do.

Has anyone else been through this before? What did you end up doing? Are there scenarios where you have to put down your friend? How well do wheel chairs work? How do you even go about paying a vet bill that large (if it comes to back surgery)?

I appreciate any responses in advance :)"	dogs
1178	[Help] My mastiff/standard poodle girl has taken to chasing cars!	"Hey all! I'm hoping some of you might be able to help me. I have a two-year-old, 120lb, Mastiff, Standard Poodle cross named Love, that I love to death. She is very well behaved but loses her ability to focus on or hear anything else if she spots a car.

We live on an acreage just off a very seldom used dirt/gravel road. Love has been here since she was nine weeks old and has had free run of our yard until recently. Our road gets busier (as in maybe 5 or 6 cars go by a day opposed to 1 maybe 2 otherwise) during seeding and harvest. Especially during harvest we experience cars flying by our yard without slowing down or paying attention often above the speed limit (often 100kmph). We have a sign saying ”Slow, watch for dog” that we are putting up to try to get people to pay attention at least. 

Anyways, so what's going on is Love has taken to chasing cars. Not just chasing them but will lay low in the front yard, which makes her very hard to spot, waiting for a vehicle then when they are just about to pass her she runs directly in front of the truck/semi/car. At least if she was on the road to start with people might see her! The other night she pulled this move in the dark when I let her our for her last bathroom trip...I saw her in the cars headlights and thought for sure she would be hit. Miraculously she was not. The other issue though is she knows not to go near the road and until recently she never would, so when I'm hollering out the door trying to get her in when a car has passed or another one is coming she will slink out of the ditch and just walk on the road away from the house, which always reminds me of a kid deciding to run away when they’re in trouble, lol. 

Now since I realized this was a new habit and not a one-off thing, she is now on supervised, leash only outings. 

I don’t know where to start to correct this behaviour. She is such a good girl and listens extremely well with the exception of now when she spots a car. She comes reliably when called, will stop and lay down to wait if she's running amuck and I tell her to stop and in general is just very eager to please and quick to learn. I'm not sure if just working on her recall so that we get to a point she will always listen would work? The plan is to someday build a fence around part of the yard but I don't have the money for that and won't for a while. 

One thing I think I did wrong was freaking out a bit when yelling/calling her when I saw a vehicle approaching because the Mastiff in her makes her so sensitive, looking at her wrong hurts her feelings and causes her to pout.  So I think that's why she might not want to come in after the ordeal because she thinks she got yelled at? Other than that I'm looking for advice on what I can do to deter her from this behaviour...I love this dog a stupid amount and can't stand the thought of anything happening to her but I don't want to take away her ability to be outside when she wants to be :( Sorry for the long post, I am just hoping if you guys have enough information maybe you can help. Thanks for taking the time to read this. "	dogs
1179	[Help] I'm meeting the rescue dog that may become mine tomorrow. I'm looking for some advice/reassurance.	"Hi everyone!

I am meeting the dog that will likely become mine tomorrow. I am SO excited and SO nervous. I've waited for years to be in a position to adopt a dog. I've spent the last several months searching, going to shelters, watching rescue websites, to find the right dog. I've been picky, because it's extremely important to me to find a dog that will be a good fit for my lifestyle. 

I saw this dog on a local rescue's website last week and immediately thought she looked like a good fit. The right weight, a good breed mix, called ""laid-back"", doesn't need a ton of exercise, already crate trained, friendly, affectionate but not clingy. I applied for her and the rescue seems really excited about my application and me adopting her. I'm meeting her tomorrow and, if everything goes well, will bring her home Friday for a one week ""trial period"". 

I'm excited, but I'm nervous about how I will know whether she's the ""right"" dog for me. So for those that have adopted rescues, work at rescues, or just know dogs, I'd appreciate some thoughts or advice along these lines of my anxieties:

Should I expect to ""connect"" with her right away? I remember being younger and volunteering in shelters and finding dogs that I just fell in love with. I feel like I've lost that as I've become more realistic about the dog that's right for me. Should I be concerned if I don't feel that ""heart feeling"" toward her when I meet her? 

Similarly, we're meeting at a park and I'm concerned that there might be so much stimulus around that it will be difficult to get her to really interact with me to see what she's like. How do I handle this? Would it be crazy to still bring her home based on the rescue's description or is that a bad sign?

What questions should I ask when I meet her? I have a list that contains things like: generally, what is she like at home? How much does she talk (bark)? Does she do well left alone? How much exercise is she getting right now? Does she sleep through the night okay? (Obviously there will be changes when/if she comes home with me due to stress but it helps to know what she's like when settled). Etc etc but what essential things would you recommend asking? 

What if I do want to return her after the one week trial? I can't lie that I would probably feel terrible. Are dogs often returned during a trial adoption period or is it just something that's offered but frowned upon/judged if the dog is returned? I 100% won't return her if she's a good fit, but if she isn't, then I don't want to feel obligated to keep her out of the shame of returning her. 

Those are my main anxieties right now but I would appreciate any advice as I move forward with this. Personal stories are greatly appreciated!

Looking for a dog around the 20 to 40 lb range.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

So me and my wife have been debating on which dog we should get for a while. My schedule is 8 to 5 and her's is 10 to 6.

The issues we run into, is that I would prefer is midsize dog which is 20 to 40lbs and easy to train. Since we would be out during the day. We are okay with getting a dog walker during the mid day. We considered the American Eskimo dog since it gets good reviews with potential children and is friendly. But i read about issues with Separation Anxiety and excessive barking.

The Mini Aussie is another option but I am not sure how the dog would do in an 860 sq foot apt. In theory we both want a Golden Retriever personality that can fit in an apartment. Is there a dog that I am missing."	dogs
1184	[Breeds] Looking to get a dog; first time owner from Australia	"\*\*Introduction\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* This will be my first dog, I have no experience training/owning dogs. I've interacted with friends dog's and dogs in the parks/streets and I'd say I'm pretty comfortable around them.

&amp;#x200B;

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?

&amp;#x200B;

\* If I can find a dog that suits me in a pound, I'm open to the idea of rescuing. If not, through a breeder is also an option 

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* A dog that that I can go running around with at parks, but is also comfortable being at a home with no backyard for \~8hrs on weekdays. A cute dog would be a huge bonus too! (My family would be more inclined to help take care of it haha). A low maintenance dog would be ideal (not too much shedding), i.e. one that only needs to be groomed once a week/once every 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Golden retriever/Aussie Shepherd/Border collies are ones I like to imagine running around with parks and stuff (theres quite a few dog-friendly parks in my area which sort of makes up for the my lack of a backyard). But smaller dogs like Pomeranians/Terriers also seem really cool!!

&amp;#x200B;

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Catch, roll over, play dead, simple stuff like that is fine! Doesn't have to be able to jump through hoops, don't need a show dog haha

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* 6 hrs (\~5hrs of passive interaction at home, \~1hr of active physical activity, e.g. walks, runs). Would do more active activity on weekends (runs/hikes)

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* About 1hr of active exercise a weekday (walks/runs) around parks and the block. Weekends \~2hrs a day, maybe hitting up a dog park every now and then

&amp;#x200B;

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd be happy to brush my dog once a week or maybe once every 2 weeks. Trimming hair and cleaning ears, maybe once a month (is that about average?) Wouldn't mind paying a dog groomer once a month or so.

1185	[HELP] Need advice on timing of a puppy	"I've been researching breeders (Australian Shepherd) for about a year and finally landed on one that I really liked and trusted. I've been on the waiting list for about 6 months and it is finally coming to the time where we'd like to bring a puppy home within the next 9 months.

Our breeder has two litters coming up, one born at the end of October to come home at the end of December, and another estimated next summer (born August, home October).

Our concerns are mostly around socialization and timing.

We play a lot of softball in the Spring/Summer (May to mid-September), so we would either like the dog to be socialized enough to be at the games or be able to socialize them at the games (loud, groups of 15-30 people, people running back and forth). I'm looking to cut down on this and just go to the games to watch my husband play.

I understand that puppy socialization is easiest in the summer months - lots of chances at parks with people jogging, biking, children's playgrounds... However the summer litters would mean a fall socialization instead, which isn't awful, since we have an active outdoor community here, so people are still out doing these activities in October. 

Another thing that factors into our timing is we're planning on having a baby sometime in early to mid-2021, which means a Summer 2019 puppy wouldn't quite be an adult yet (20ish months). Because of this, we're interested in the litter due in October. This would put the bring-home date at the end of December, with the socialization window on our end at January-February. 

While winters here don't get as bad as other parts of Canada, it still gets pretty snowy and blistery, keeping people inside. Even the hiking trails don't have that much foot traffic. What are your thoughts on socializing a puppy in the winter? The small list I have are:

* puppy socialization classes
* indoor mall
* stores that allow dogs like home depot
* banks
* gatherings with family and friends (and their dogs)
* bring into the office a couple of times
* skating rinks
* outdoor activities that draw crowds

I'm not sure if this socialization is enough, especially for a breed that is naturally reserved with strangers. In the summer, we'd be able to go to parks every day and visit different urban spaces, as our city is pretty tourist-y.

So while we think the earlier the better (so we can have a well-adjusted and fully trained dog before baby comes), we're worried about winter socialization - especially since the breed is naturally reserved and requires more socialization.

Another strike against this 2018 Fall litter is that we'll have just moved into our new home in mid-October, so by the time the puppy comes home, we'll have only been settled into our home for 2 months. I'm not sure this is enough time for our current dog to settle before bringing a new pup home?

What are your thoughts into which litter we should go with? Are there any other considerations we haven't thought of?

​

TL;DR: Which litter should I go with? Pro/Con list below

​

|2018 Fall|2019 Summer|
|:-|:-|
|**PRO**|**PRO**|
|Get a litter sooner - been wanting a new puppy for a couple of years and am really excited|Easier to socialize when it's warmer|
|Train the puppy through the spring/summer, when I have a lot more time|Will be better settled into our new home|
|Will be in adult-hood by the time baby comes|Litter parents have better temperaments|
|**CON**|**CON**|
|Might be too soon after moving into a new home|May still be a teenager when baby comes (20 months)|
|Winter socialization/potty training|Will have to wait 1 more year for puppy - our current dog is already 12 (but a smaller dog, so he's slowed down, but hopefully still has a few years left), would like to bring new dog before he gets too old.|
|Parents have more reserve than Summer parents (still friendly but may require more socialization)|Will be 9 months before parks and trails get busy again with joggers/runners/etc (but Fall socialization will be better than winter in terms of foot traffic and weather?)|

1186	[help] My dog, who likes lying near my feet, has been growling when I move. How can I stop this?	"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some help with my kelpie x heeler x who knows what. He's 1.5 years old, came from a shelter but we've had him since he was a pup. He's very friendly, and had never displayed aggression towards humans. He likes to be near us, and often sleeps on the couch or our bed at my feet/next to my legs. A few weeks ago, he was lying next to my legs on the couch and when I moved my legs, he growled. I didn't think much of it because he was asleep and I thought maybe I startled him or he had not realised it was me. However, this has become quite frequent now, and he will do it even when awake and seeing it is me who is moving. He also does the same to my husband. He is not unfriendly in any other way or in any other situation. He's also not moving to bite, he just growls.  


  
I'm not sure what has prompted this behaviour, the only thing I can think of is that my in-laws' dog growls very often at him (she hates him but for various reasons they need to co-exist in the same space quite often). I noticed that when they're in the car together and touch bums, she will growl at him and he will now growl back. That's the only thing I can think of that may have influenced him to learn this, but I don't know whether he could have generalised that behaviour to us moving our legs. But most importantly, how do I stop him from doing this? We're pretty quick to tell him off when he does this, but it doesn't seem to be helping.

1187	[Discussion] How to make the most of the time my girl has left	My baby girl, Izzie, a 9 year old shih tzu/maltese mix, had exploratory surgery yesterday, and what they found was not good. She has cancer in her abdomen that's already attached to her left kidney, liver, intestines. Right now she's still my happy little Izz. She's excited to go for a walk, to eat, and is still peeing and pooping regularly. She does not appear to be in any pain or discomfort yet; however, despite this, her surgeon is guessing she has about a month left. Any advice, tips, etc on how to make the most of the time she has left? I want her to have only the very best days for as long as possible. 	dogs
1188	[discussion] She blames me for her dog attacking mine.	"I'm dog sitting at the moment and the dog I'm minding is a gentle labradoodle. He is wary of our cats and misses his cat brother.

I took him to the dog park near us and I wanted to do a lap of the park to meet the dogs before I let him off lead.

The meetings went well and he was fine with the other dogs and they with him. I stopped to start taking his harness off and the husky we'd met decided to attack him, ran at him from about 5m away to bite him. The German Shepard we'd met decided it wanted in as well after that. Luckily none of the bites made it through the skin though he lost a few big chunks of fur.

But the dogs were attacking for almost 30 seconds before their owners decided to even try to intervene. ""No"" and ""stop"" did nothing and both had to hold their dogs back, after I pushed them away a dozen times.

The worst part though was afterwards, they told me it was because my dog was at a disadvantage because he was on lead. 

1. They'd already met a few minutes ago with no problems, my dog clearly understood and responded to the idea that the lead meant no playing.

2. I should, without fail, let my dog off lead at the dog park or it's my fault if they get attacked.

3. The owner of the husky was telling me how she was a therapy dog and she would never do anything. And now that phrase is going to be triggering for me forever.

4. And of course, unharnessing your dog inside the dog park is a bad idea.

I've been dog walking for 5 years now and managed to never meet people with this attitude before. They seem to think that because they let their dogs sort themselves out off leash that they're perfect. And that because I'm dog sitting I don't know anything.

Edit: I've learned a lot today, about dog parks and about this subreddit. 

* This subreddit doesn't like the existence of off-lead dog parks that allow leashed dogs. And some users will actively blame leads for the aggressive behaviours of some dogs. I personally think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of dogs, and probably animals in general, and that if you support the idea that interactions between on-lead and off-lead dogs is by nature asking for a fight then you're being deliberately provocative to prove some sort of point that humans are superior or something. 

* Even if I was in the wrong and having a leashed dog is bad and I shouldn't have done it, anyone defending that the aggressive dog's owner shouldn't have more of the blame was downvoted. The dog that *literally* bit another dog should be *at most* equally blamed as the dog on a leash minding its own business. So keep that in mind... The people who vote here think that accepting blame for attacking someone is wrong and the victim should be blamed for provoking them.

* Implying that I knew what I was doing and had in fact gone through very similar scenarios before also garnered downvotes. So I guess my experiences are invalid and wrong. I should just stop pretending that anything I have experienced is meaningful and readily accept everything ever said to me as the gospel truth.

* Hyperbole will be misinterperted, which is honestly a good mistake for a dog training group so that's not so bad.

* Oh, and don't trust strangers' dogs at a dog park. They may be poorly trained and believe their dog's behaviour is dictated by other people's actions and therefore uncontrollable."	dogs
1189	[Breed] for 20's mil couple w/ 4 year old	"[BREED] Best fit for 20's with 4 year old son.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
-No, I previously had a Treeing Walker Hound. He was stubborn and deaf while following his nose, but was a good dog and adept learner. He knew many commands, times of day for our routines, and actually decided to never bark following his 1st birthday.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
-Breeder or pup from a rescue, so I can be there from day one.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.
Medium to Large in stature, calm and strong, but loving around family. This fits my personality and would also fit well with my wife and 4 year old son. Somewhat protective is a good trait but not necessary.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
-I like the idea of a big dog, but I'm more concerned with my son's wellbeing and comfort. A medium dog breed like a poodle or lab seems like it'd he safer, but I'm selfish and need to hear common sense from a neutral party.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
-Intermediate commands and daily routines.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
-I work doing projects from home, so I would be able to devote most of the day to my son and a new dog.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
- 45 minutes. I workout daily, and a running partner would be fine. The dog doesnt need to be a runner, though. My hound was a lazy dude 23.5 hours a day and I liked that quite a bit.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
-Daily brushing, I would pay for nails to be done, as that makes me uneasy. Cleaning ears is something I am comfy with, as in the humid south I had to keep an eye on my hound's ears.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?
-Big, but I know medium would be better for the family and would be happy with a companion over a size.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
-Shedding and slobber are fine, but I'd rather not have a long haired dog that requires constant vaccuming. Barking is unavoidable, but I'd prefer a dog that doesn't feel the need to bark all day. Or much at all, to be honest. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
-Not very. If my dog isnt in the yard I dont intend to have him off leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
-I like having my dog with me a lot, but I don't have to be in physical contact with it to be happy.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
-Both, but I guess eager to please would be best for the family.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
-Barking, going to the door, but not going wild.
With caution, but not disdain.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
Less aggressive the better. Have a 4 year old son, so a relaxed composure would be best.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
-Besides constant barking, not really.

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
-Maybe an occassional night for 3 or 4 hours, but normally our dog goes where we go unless its to dinner. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
-My wife loves all dogs over 10 pounds and is crazy devoted to any pet we would have. She would be heavily involved in spoiling more than training.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
-No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
-My son(4 years old) everyday.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
-Rent in the future (wife is military, we move every couple years). Current lease says no pits.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
-None that I am aware of.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
-90 summer and 45 to 50 winter.

1191	[HELP] What are your best tips to help a dog gain weight?	"We adopted a new rescue dog (1.5M) on Saturday. He generally seems happy, settled, and not anxious at all (unless he's in his crate, which we ditched until he gets more comfortable). We have another dog and they get along great.

However, this new dog is not eating much and is probably 5 pounds underweight (he's 16.6 right now). I've been putting some wet dog food on top of his kibble each day. He eats the wet food and a bit of the dry food ~3 times per day, but that's it. He'll eat dog treats, but isn't really willing to work for them (no trick training yet - just trying to get him comfortable with his crate. He loses interest super fast).

I know that all the local news stations and shelters put out tips for pet owners in the heat, and they usually suggest only taking dogs out in the early morning and after sunset so they don't burn their paws on the pavement.

I usually stop home from work at lunch time (AKA the hottest part of the day) to let my dog out of her crate to stretch her legs/go to the bathroom/go on a short walk—but what should I be doing on days when it's this hot? There's no grass or dirt anywhere even remotely near my house, just concrete and asphalt. Do I just take her in the shade and hope that she'll use the bathroom there, then come back inside? Come home to let her out of the crate, but just play inside and wait for a potty break until later? I want her to get some energy out but don't want to hurt her in the process!"	dogs

1194	[Help] My puppy has some blood in his stool	"I’ve already made the vet appointment in two hours I’m just freaking out. 

I have a nine week old Ridgeback. He is my first dog and the light of my life. He’s boisterous and healthy. Except when he poops he seems to have a hard time relaxing outside and I’ve started noticing a tiny bit of red blood in his poop. Now I thought it might be stress, it wasn’t a lot (literally the tiniest amount). 

This morning however he went and a few drops of just blood dripped out. Oh hell no. I instantly booked an appointment. His stool was also a little loose.

He has no other issues, he’s eating and drinking normally, no vomit, no lethargy, no pain that I can tell. He’s of course not fully vaccinated yet but I never take him to dog parks and just do a short walk up and down the road and there aren’t many other dogs where I am. 

What other issues could be causing this that are not something horrible like parvo? Is it just stress from adjusting to a new home??? I’m so worried :( 

Update: There’s nothing seriously wrong with the little shit, his anal gland was just a bit swollen causing him to push too hard. I got tests ordered anyway and he’s on a bland diet for a bit in case it’s a bacteria. I felt a lot less worried after I got the $400 bill (AUD). He’s at home content as fuck. Little rascal. I’d still jump in front of a bus for him and his gross anal glands tho! "	dogs
1195	[Help] Could you share your experiences with hemangiosarcoma?	"A couple months ago we started noticing small black/dark red bumps appearing on our white boxer's body - especially her stomach and hind legs. We figured it was just an allergic reaction to rolling in the grass, but new ones kept popping up every week and we began to get concerned...

The vet removed them today and told us he's pretty sure it's hemangiosarcoma and very serious, though the biopsy results wont come back for several days. Is this usually hemangio starts? Most of the articles I've read online don't mention growths on the skin - only tumors on the spleen that rupture without warning. Our pup seems to be in perfect health apart from these odd growths - gums are pink, healthy weight, playing.

I'd really appreciate input from anyone who's had a dog diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma. Does it usually begin with these tiny black bumps? What sorts of things should we be expecting?

We're very heartbroken and afraid right now, so we're grateful for any advice. Thank you so much!"	dogs

"I'm working on crate training my puppy for just very small amounts of time during the day, only 15 seconds to 4 minutes at a time . I make sure he's peed, and then I give him a treat to go in, close the door and give him a treat and then I hide around the corner and wait about 15 seconds, then I open the crate, he doesn't whine at all during this time. 
BUT when I go to the washroom and leave him for 4 mins he starts to whine. So after 4 mins I wait 4ish seconds after he's stopped barking to go around the corner and open the crate.

Is this an effective method ? Should I wait till he's quiet for a little longer like 10 seconds ?

1204	[Help] My dog won't get out of car/come in house in the morning	"I take my dog (1.5 year old lab) on a car ride to get coffee and go for a walk every morning.  He's always eager to go.  But when we get home now he won't get out of the car and acts stubborn coming in the house.  

He is extremely food motivated and now refuses my treat bribes.

The only way to get him to come in is to leave him in the car (door open) and wait for him to finally decide he doesn't want to be out there alone.

THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING.

I'm guessing it's because he doesn't want to go back in the house because I usually leave to do errands/work.  But I work from home in the mornings so I don't leave immediately.

Any tips?

I tried withholding his breakfast until after the morning walk so he looks forward to coming in to breakfast, but he threw up bile once because I'm assuming he was REALLY HUNGRY (he used to do this as a puppy if I woke up too late).

Any tips???

And it's not getting in and out of the car specifically.  He does that with glee any other time."	dogs
1205	[Help] What breed of dog is this?	"Thanks for your help in advance. We rescued this good girl Alice last weekend. The shelter told us she is a Red Heeler / Aust. Cattle Dog mix. I've seen other dogs that looks exactly like her and she seems coloured like a jack russel but doesn't seem to be that breed at all.

1206	[Help] Recommendations for wireless dog fence?	"So before you start writing out that it may not work for my dog or whatever, we've had great success with an underground wired dog fence. She has been trained with it from an early age and is well accustomed to it.

Our current underground wire system broke down, so I'm looking to replace it with a wireless one.

It's quite hard to find good info. Petsafe have some systems, but they use a basestation as the center of the safe zone, which I've read causes problems if you have a house with thick walls. I know Motorola have one, but it seems to work on the same principle as the Petsafe one.

What are some other options to consider? I'm surprised I'm not seeing more GPS based options. Thanks!"	dogs
1207	[Help] How and when is the right time to ask breeders about puppy price?	"I’ve had a couple back and forth messages with a breeder. Things are going positively so far and I am preparing to call them soon to discuss things in more detail. 

This would be my first dog from a breeder rather than a rescue. My primary goal is to avoid offending the breeder while at the same time making sure I get the dog I want out of this transaction. I’m very worried that my inexperience in this realm will be apparent and I will say something that will cause the breeder to think I’m being cheap. Ask too soon and it will seem like money is the only thing I care about. We’ve all heard how expensive dogs are over the course of their lifetime and how a one time cost shouldn’t be the deciding factor. However, I need to know how much money to start setting aside and if I ask too late, I will have had a months long correspondence about a dog I can’t afford. I truly have no idea what to expect since I am looking at a rather rare breed.  As with most reputable breeders, this one doesn’t post cost and deposit details on their website or kennel Facebook page. 

All this to ask a simple question: when is the right time to ask? How should I ask (a transcript would be helpful, seriously I have so much anxiety over this)? 

Thank you!!"	dogs

1209	[Breeds] What breed is my new rescue pup?	"After a long process, I finally rescued a dog over the weekend. Sophie is \~1 year old and the rescue listed her as a lab mix. Ultimately, I didn't care about her breed because I was focused on temperament. The trainer that I'm working with (my partner's dad) has been working with her for a few days and when he first saw her, he stated that her coat appeared like a lab but she doesn't have the build of a lab - he's raised and trained labs for \~20 years. As of yesterday, he believes that she looks like a short-haired border collie.

I know she's a mutt of some kind, but what breed do you see with you look at her? 5 pics included in the link below for reference.

1210	[Breeds] Moving out soon and I might finally be in a position to get a dog! Can I get some feedback on breeds that might be good for me?	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*This will be my first dog and first pet ever. In college a room mate brought his yellow lab over for 2 weeks and I had the experience of playing with her and feeding her, but nothing beyond that.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No

* My ideal dog would be a medium to large breed, non-aggressive and not too difficult to control, good with children or smaller animals such as cats, and will welcome my company any time but isn't too dependent.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I'm not sure to be honest. I've always wanted a Husky but I could never own one due to my kind of lifestyle. I also admire Saint Bernards but I hear they aren't good for first time owners, and I won't be around all the time and I hear that they don't like to be alone so that will be a problem. My friend recommended me a mixed lab.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Maybe to bring something on command or just be able to understand simple things, like whenits ok to jump on the bed or when its time to go back into thier kennel

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours max

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* medium to large.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* none of this is a problem except for barking. I don’t think I can handle excessive barking at night.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important. However, I’d like to be able to do this. My main concern is a dog that will run away or towards other people and not head my command if I tell them to stop, or a dog who may act aggressively towards other people or aniamls

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly, but would be preferable if they can stay comfortable alone for an extended period of time

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Wants to do its own thing

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Irrelevant to me. Won’t have too many visitors when I move out. However I’d rather my dog not act aggressively towards new people

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Other than aggression, no.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I’ll be working 8am-5pm so this one might be a problem. Of course, maybe I could find a dog sitter.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* N/A

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* N/A

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I am aware of the laws, I will be in MA.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter – -2 Summer – 56 f

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

1212	[HELP] Help with some behavior	"so, a little bit of background. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ringo is a 3 yr old, neutered, St. Bernard rescued 2 and a half years ago from the streets. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has always been pretty docile with family members however he can get pretty aggressive with strangers. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 girls that work for us doing household chores. Ringo would bark at them once in a while but recently it's getting out of hand and he runs towards them barking and obviously the girls do get scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

However once he gets to them he either tried to grab their hands/arms with its mouth (i know it sounds like he is biting but he doesn't bite he pulls without harming the arm, he has done it with me to get my attention) or just sits and requests affection. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 90% sure he won't bite them ever. However due to its size having it run towards you its understandably nerve racking.

Any recommendations to diminish this behavior?"	dogs

1217	[Help] Dogs been sick for a few days	"[update] Aug 31st - I ended up taking my puppy to the vet yesterday, saw some change in behavior and the length of time I decided enough was enough. I brought a fecal sample along in case it would be helpful and they tested it. Got back to me today and told me she had contracted hook worm! Poor girl :( I did not see anything in her stool all week that indicated worms. Wednesday night, I noticed little white specks, so maybe they were there all along but not large enough for me to see? I don't know. Get her on the medication today and hopefully she will get better quickly!


[Original post]
Good day, I got a 6 month old puppy, for the past few days she has had the runs and soft stool. The first day she pooped up some painters tape pieces, nothing large and I know she didn't get the majority of what she was eating. Nothing since.

She has been going more then often, causing accidents in the house and her crate during the day.

At one point it did come out mucusy. However it was a couple poops over a morning.

I have been making sure she has access to water, she is eating her food and I have been putting some canned stuff in it as well to encourage her to eat. 

The past couple days she has been jumping around, playing with me and doing normal things, I feel she is a bit more sleepy then usual.

I am not seeing anything to worry about, I have called my vet a couple times and they say theirs nothing to worry about. 

This is the first time shes been sick and I'm not sure how long she will take to get better or what I can give her to help her get over it.

I have been recommended canned pumpkin, so I am going to get that and give it to her tonight after work and for dinner. 

She just had bloodwork done and there was nothing wrong with her (like the week prior to this). 

Any thoughts? Anything I can give her/do to calm her stomach and get her better?

Thanks."	dogs

Once on the street, he will boop my booty exactly 2 times, then gently grab the leash close to my hand and then just walk next to me holding the leash.

I dunno, maybe he thinks I cannnot find the way home myself so he would have to lead me home?

1224	Porch Potty [HELP]	"In two weeks my family is moving to an apartment in Phoenix! Our 11 month old red heeler has finally decided that she wants to be potty trained.

She just preferred going inside until very recently. Kill me.)

Since she won't have a backyard to potty in and it'll be really hot, I think it would be very convenient to have a porch potty set up. Like a grass/turf pad she can use on our shaded porch.

1226	[Discussion] PSA: Emotional Support Animal laws are very different outside the USA. Know the laws for your region.	"On a dog-related Facebook group, there was a recent discussion about one of our favorite topics in this here subreddit: ESAs. It all started off with someone posting that they wanted to ""register"" their puppy as an Emotional Support Animal (and would cost about $300 to do so) so that they ""would not have any problems with landlords"". Predictably, the conversation moved to discussing how irresponsible it is to abuse the ESA designation in this way.

The dog group in which this conversation took place is specific to Alberta. The original poster was from Alberta, and the other participants were all from Alberta. 

Alberta does not recognize any such thing as an ""Emotional Support Animal"". The only thing that is recognized in this province are [Service Dogs](https://www.alberta.ca/service-dog-information.aspx). There is no landlord and tenant law in Alberta that recognizes ESAs or grants any special access to animals that provide emotional support in any way that is analogous to the American Disabilities Act in the United States (though the landlord and tenant laws may differ in this respect in other provinces). Likewise, there is no Federal law that recognizes anything other than registered Service Dogs in Canada. 

The topic of ESAs comes up quite often here, I see, but it is important to understand that in many ways, the entire concept of ESAs as discussed here is very much limited to how they are recognized in the United States. "	dogs
1227	[Discussion] Lack of owner-friendly pet carrier backpacks available anywhere	"We’re the owners of a 22 lbs Shiba Inu, who loves to travel by subway and train about twice a week. He’s small but dense. We originally purchased a backpack that’s similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/PetAmi-Premium-Backpack-Ventilated-Designed/dp/B073XGDZ4S), until it started falling apart after 2 or 3 months. It was not well designed as it became painful to support the weight on my hips. In the meantime, our pup was outgrowing the backpack. This is when we noticed how rare it is to see owner-friendly designs for pet carriers. It seems most expensive / reputable pet carriers are always designed for the pet’s comforts, but none for the owner who carries the carrier.

The best backpack we have tried, however, is [K-9 sports sack](https://www.amazon.com/K9-Sport-Sack-Adjustable-Veterinarian/dp/B01N1OC7EB). Sadly it doesn’t match our local subway/train regulation for a pet carrier. 

Our current carrier is [SleepyPod Air](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepypod-Air-Cabin-Carrier-Black/dp/B002Z6005M) designed for carrying on a suitcase. It is a good quality product, except it’s not always possible to carry it on a suitcase... When that happens, there is only one single strap concentrating the entire weight on the owner’s shoulder. Eventually it started causing us back pain, though we minimize the amount of time that our pup needs to be in there for (i.e., taking elevator, escalator, or let him walk himself when possible). 

Earlier this week, we finally had it enough. After months of research, we’ve been hesitant about getting Kurgo’s new [G-train](https://www.amazon.com/Kurgo-G-Train-Backpack-Carrier-Adventurous/dp/B07CRS4FWW), the only carrier backpack we found so far that considers the owner’s needs more than the other options on the market. Kurgo products have been holding up OK for us, so we decided to take a chance. 

Forgive me if this post sounds like ranting. In the past few months, we’ve been researching so much on available carrier options. It has been exhausting. We even considered a stroller at one point, but gave up on it due to portability issues. Are we the only ones noticing how difficult it is for owners regarding pet carriers? Especially for dogs that are heavier than 10 lbs?

Edit: spelling "	dogs
1228	[Fluff] I used to get annoyed by how long it would take my dog to use the bathroom outside. We finally moved somewhere with a fenced in yard and she now does her business as quickly as humanly (dogly?) possible	"I'm not sure if it's because she feels nervous outside without me, or because we live in a much more populated area now. I think it is the latter because she did it once when I was out on the back deck with her. It used to take her 5-10 minutes *minimum* to find a spot to pee, longer for pooping when I would let her out on leash to use the bathroom at our last house. We lived in a pretty rural area with no real neighbors and trees on all sides of our yard. We now live in a neighborhood with neighbors on either side of our fence. Now whenever I let her outside she RUNS to the grass, pees as fast as she can, and runs back to the porch and starts scratching the door. If I don't open the door immediately she will jump up and look through the glass until I let her back inside. I once left her out back and I was out front talking to someone and she started crying (it was like 10 mins in nice weather)

I just think it's funny that now that we finally have a fenced in yard for her to take as much time as she needs, she now wants to spend as little time as possible outside!"	dogs

1235	[Breeds] - TL;DR Not sure we're looking at the right breeds. Please help us find a medium to large friendly dog!	"**\*\*Introduction\*\***

​

**1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

I had dogs growing up: an old English sheepdog rescue and a beagle-fox terrier mix rescue.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/**[**http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**)?**

I'm open to either but have a slight preference for a reputable breeder, as I'm hoping to get a puppy that's been well-socialized during its first weeks.  This would be my first puppy.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

Friendly, easy to train, good recall, not high maintenance. Bonus points if they're mellow. I live in the suburbs with my husband and there's a mix of nature and city so our dog would come with us on neighborhood hikes as well as downtown walks. On weekdays we're homebodies (outside of a daily neighborhood walk or two), so we're looking for a dog that can also hang out with us on the couch. On weekends, we do more -- lots of nature, road trips, and social activity that our dog would be a part of.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I'm leaning towards non-stubborn hypoallergenic breeds not because my husband or I are allergic, but because members of our extended family (who would visit) are. Our dog doesn't \*have\* to be hypoallergenic though. The dogs we're realistically interested are standard poodles, giant schnauzers (a bit concerned about these guys as I've heard they can be really protective and stubborn), and golden retrievers (I know they shed a ton). Honest disclosure: my husband isn't crazy about the standard poodle look (he's warming up to some of the short clipped poodles) -- it took me a while to warm up too.

If size/temperament/trainability weren't an issue, we'd lean towards dobermans, Bernese mountain dogs, Irish wolfhounds, samoyeds, Belgian tervuren, and Australian shepherds. I gravitate towards the herding and working breeds. Expectations/reality.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Basic obedience and safety is important. It's important that my dog be house-trained, be able to be around kids and older people, and (friendly) dogs.

​

**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

Several hours a day, especially while they're a puppy. In the long-term, I will spend weekends, mornings, and evenings with them, at the very least. Either my husband or myself are often at home, so our dog wouldn't be bored frequently.

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

45 minutes on the low end, 3 or 4 hours a day on the high end. Realistically I expect I'll average 1 1/2 hours each day: a quick morning walk and then a longer evening walk/exercise/play.

**8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I can brush their hair anywhere from every couple of days to every week and will need to learn how to properly trim hair and clean ears, which I'm happy to do. I can also pay a professional to groom them regularly.

​

**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***

**9) What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium to large.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Medium to low shedding is fine. Occasional barking is okay but we don't want a dog that barks nonstop.  Not into excessive slobber.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It would be nice but it's not a top priority.

**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly dog for sure.

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager-to-please, with the understanding that they'd probably want to do their own thing sometimes too.

**14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I don't have a strong preference -- it could be anything from barking at strangers to warmly greeting visitors to running to notify me that someone is at the door.

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

This makes me nervous. I want to say yes but am not sure I'd know how to manage a dog that's aggressive to other dogs. I'd really like to avoid this scenario.

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Escape artist behavior and aggression towards dogs, neighborhood cats, children, people.

​

**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

We may leave the dog alone occasionally when we can't bring our dog, but they would never be alone longer than a few hours. I expect they'll home alone 2 to 3 times a week from 2 to 5 hours at a time. (Relatedly: I plan to crate train our dog for bedtime and alone time.)

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My husband prefers the fluffy breeds (he LOVES samoyeds and Bernese mountain dogs) but understands that realistically, these aren't the right breeds for us. This will be his first dog. He will exercise and take care of the dog with me.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

We don't have any other pets but our dog will spend time (a couple times a month) with my sister's Australian shepherd when we visit each other.

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

No, although we may have children in the next couple of years.

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We own our home.

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

We live in the Bay Area, California and there are no laws banning certain breeds that I'm aware of.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

High 80s to mid-90s in the summer and 50s to 60s in the winter.

1236	[Help] Terrible Twos with a Pembroke Welsh Corgi	"Hello all! Long time lurker of this sub - first time poster.

​

My wife and I got our Corgi Willow when she was 9 weeks old and have never been away from her for more than 2-3 day since. She was an incredible puppy, potty training was a breeze (only ever had 1 accident inside), she loved to kennel, and she followed commands flawlessly. She handled our other dogs well and even handled the addition of a puppy over a year ago, with no problems. She has always been a skittish dog from the moment we brought her own she was afraid of her own shadow. Let me be very clear in saying that me and my wife have NEVER physically punished Willow. She's gotten a stern ""NO"" when trying to pick something up that wasn't hers or steals one of the other dogs treats but she has never even gotten a nose tap. We truly have no idea where the skittish nature came from and chalked it up to her being from a not so great chain of pet stores.

​

Fast forward to 4 months ago when out of no where she started being disobedient. She turned 2 in March of 2017 and it started almost immediately after. She refuses to come out of her kennel to go outside - for no apparent reason. Weather doesn't matter, enticing with treats does nothing, even me getting on the floor in front of her kennel and calling her name does nothing. I have to physically pick her up and out of her kennel to go outside now. She even goes as far as to faking me out! She'll get out of her kennel and run towards the door - seemingly excited to go outside and then she'll turn the other way and go back into her kennel! She acts very timid when I go to take her out of her kennel but I am not asking for anything new here - she's been going outside fine for 2 years! Nothing in the environment has changed, nothing at all. Some days she will go outside just fine but not want to come in until I start to walk outside and then she runs towards the door.

​

I've seen on some Corgi group pages that terrible twos are a trend with this breed and they get some sort of complex at this age. Does anyone else have experience with this? Any idea how to break this habit she has? I have tried treats, different ways of enticing her out of the kennel, etc. I just feel like she is doing it just to do it with no real rhyme or reason.

​

Thank you!"	dogs
1237	[Discussion] Yes, I feed my Sighthound	"Anyone else who owns a sighthound will probably get this, for anyone else: 

Greyhounds, Whippets, Borzoi, Saluki etc are all super thin dogs with arched backs, tucked in stomachs and long skinny legs. And for some reason, the majority of the general public believes that an obese dog is a healthy dog and that a perfectly healthy sighthound is starving. It's perfectly normal for their ribs to be visible, especially when they're breathing heavily during excersize. Yes, I'm aware he has knobby wrists and that you can see his hip bones. 

I can't take my Borzoi to the park without someone mentioning his weight. Some people go the passive, fake nice, beat-around-the-bush route: ""Oh, he's so skinny, is he a rescue?"" ""Oh, he's so thin, is he sick?"" Others prefer to throw slightly heavier shade: ""What does your vet think about his weight?"" ""He looks like he could use some food""

And then there's the dense ones who are always right and you can't convince them otherwise. The ones who whip out their food made of God knows what and just start feeding it to your dog without even telling you it's about to happen. The ones who blatantly announce that your dog is disgustingly thin and you should consider rehoming them if you can't care for them properly.

1242	[help] New dog wont eat	Hey! I know this is probably a common question but we just adopted a coon hound last Saturday. He’s adjusted well into the home even with the cat except for eating. He’s a 75lb dog and he barely eats and it’s almost like we have to force him. He wont beg with people food and he will snack a little on treats but it’s been a few days and his eating habits haven’t changed. He’ll poop (diarrhea first and second day but hasn’t had any since) and pee. Any advice on how to get him to eat? He doesn’t have worms either. 	dogs
1243	[Help] Puppy stares at cat	"Hello!  Last week I adopted the first dog I've had since I lost my last little buddy six years ago.  After getting over a mild case of the puppy blues, I'm in love.  My pup is 6 or 7 months old, and came from outside the country (Bosnia).  She's a mutt, but if I had to hazard a guess at breeds I can see some German shepherd and terrier in her.

​

Although her trip over here was stressful, she's adapting remarkably; she bonded with me in about five seconds, and with my housemate in about two hours.  We do have a cat, and their introduction went better than I could have asked for.  When I first brought the dog home, they both expressed interest in each other (curious body language) and even sat near each other (for which they were both rewarded with treats).​

​

As the week as gone by, I noticed the dog has begun to stare at the cat - I mean fixate.  I will call her name or nudge her and she still stares until the cat goes out of view.  Earlier today she even tried to go up and sniff the cat, who showed minimal signs of discomfort (allowed a sniff in her face) but jogged away when the dog tried to come around and sniff his butt.  I mention this because it doesn't seem that the dog wants to go after the cat - the dog also seems to be mildly afraid of the cat in fact.  If the cat's blocking the hallway, the dog stops and looks for another way around.  But still, something about how intensely she stares bothers me.  The only time they've gotten in a little quibble was when the cat tried to eat out of the dog's bowl once.  The dog barked, the cat scampered away.  The cat remains interested in the dog's food bowl and water bowl.

​​

I've read advice on introducing the pets, but they did so well (and because of how my place is set up, I have limited options for blocking them away from each other) that I didn't follow the introduction guidelines (aside from feeding them at the same time and in each others' presence).  I'm hoping I didn't set a bad precedent...but I guess my questions are: why does she stare so much?  Is there something I can do to break her concentration?  Do I have reason to worry?

​​

Thanks!!"	dogs
1244	[Discussion] what do you think is the appropriate amount of time to leave a puppy alone?	"Ok, so as i know and some of you know this has been a long debate in every puppy owner out there; how much is too much to leave your dog alone when he's a puppy?

Now, I have seen some people say crazy stuff ranging to leaving him alone all day, to not taking him out of your sight! Now both of these are the extremes, and i don't really agree with either of them. Now i agree a puppy can't be left alone for such a long time, and that he needs to be taken outside to relieve himself, but i personally believe that a two moth old puppy can make it on his own for one hour an a half if he's properly trained and exercised.

I personally don't believe in the 'you are a terrible human being if you leave your dog alone for one second, and should never have a dog if you do!' and trust me i'm not exaggerating i have seen, and heard people say that.    I personally used to leave my three month old puppy alone for three hours at most, and nothing terrible happened to him, and he seemed OK with it -i did exercise him a lot, and trained him before hand so he knows to be more independent. But, that doesn't mean i agree that you should leave your dog for the whole day at home, no matter how old he or she might be.

So what do you guys think? how long can you leave your puppy alone?"	dogs

1246	[HELP] 8-year-old lab lived with dogs his whole life, but now barks at them and seems aggressive?	"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I moved out of my parents home and a state away to accept a full time job offer. I took my 8-year-old lab/golden mix with me because he's always been more attached to me, and wasn't getting the attention he needed at my parents home. He is much happier here with me and my boyfriend. There is almost always someone at home with him, as my partner and I work opposite schedules, and he goes on two nice, long walks a day, which he never had before as my parents would just let the dogs out in the yard.

&amp;#x200B;

He has lived with multiple dogs over the years. All golden retrievers, except for one Shih Tzu. He has never been aggressive, has never bit another dog or person in his entire life. He is a little skittish and has a bit of anxiety, but he is honestly the goofiest little love ball that I've ever met. He really, truly just wants everyone to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that I'm currently facing is his aggressiveness with other dogs when we're on walks. I am typically the one who takes him on his longer walks (one in the morning and one in the late afternoon/early evening) as I am the first one up and the only one home during those times. I find that when I walk him and we pass by other dogs or if he even sees another dog he will bark, and even try to lunge toward them. I've taken to crossing the street if I see another dog coming, but there have been a few surprise incidents where a dog came around the corner at my apartment complex, or someone walked out of their door with their dog and my dog just FREAKED out. Barking and trying to get closer to the dog. I do not believe he would bite, unless otherwise provoked or attacked, but I'm confused as he's gotten along with other dogs for so long and has never had an incident even with foreign dogs. Just the other weekend we took a trip back home to my parents house and my brother brought his 1 year old Australian Shepard and my dog didn't bark once at him.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any idea why he would be acting this way? My boyfriend says that he is less reactive to dogs when he walks him, and that maybe my dog is ""protecting"" me, so to speak? I didn't really think that labs/goldens would act that way, as they're usually friendly with just about anyone and anything. He has barked at dogs walking by my parents house before, but again, never in a truly malicious way or ""attack-like"" way. I'm just worried he'll never be able to get along with other dogs again, and that makes me sad as we would like to adopt another little one in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that all made sense, sorry for the rambling!"	dogs
1247	[Help] Dog Fights Me To Come Inside	"As my post states, my 2 year old golden retriever refuses and fights me when it’s time to go inside. 

We currently live in an apartment so every morning, afternoon and night I take my dog out for his scheduled bathroom trip. As of lately he’s fought me terribly after he’s finished his business about coming inside. Twice he’s slipped his collar and I ended up having to chase him around. 

I’m at the point where as soon as he finishes doing his doo he starts tugging to try and slip his collar. We’ve tightened up so he can no longer slip it and I’ve learned to not fight his pulling so that I don’t hurt or lose him. 

Has anyone had this issue before with their pups? I’m losing my mind at this point. I’ve been late to work in the morning and after lunch breaks multiple times due to this new issue. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. "	dogs

1249	[HELP] Chihuahua puppy has learned how to climb OUT of her play pen!	"Hi r/dogs!

First time dog owner here. My dog ""Miffy"" is a \~4.5 month old Chihuahua mix. She is 3.6 pounds. She has been a really great puppy overall!

Today, when I came home, I noticed that Miffy was outside of her pen, but the pen door was closed. I knew something was up, because I ALWAYS keep Miffy in her pen when I can't supervise her. Maintenance was working outside my room, so I assumed that they heard Miffy inside and wanted to let her out. (I leave Miffy's pen inside my room, and my door was unlocked.) I leave again to get food, making sure that Miffy was inside her pen. This time, I lock my door. 

When I come back, Miffy is AGAIN outside her pen!

Later on, I manage to snatch a photo of [this](https://i.imgur.com/NIVC1Ra.jpg). Miffy is literally using her pen as a ladder to climb out! This time, she slipped and fell back inside :( She didn't seem hurt, thankfully.

This has never happened before. I think her climbing is ""triggered"" by wanting to greet people she hears/sees outside. In the climbing photo, she just saw my new roommates who moved in, and really wanted to greet them. 

In the previous incident, I think she wanted to greet the maintenance men that were working outside, so she climbed out of her pen. (Miffy is a social butterfly. She isn't much of a barker yet, but will whine for attention when I have friends over and she is put in her play pen. She is quiet when left alone, and doesn't seem to have separation anxiety.)

What should I do? I am worried that if she keeps climbing out, she could fall and hurt herself. 

Should I just get rid of the play pen completely, and let her free roam my room? She is fairly consistent with her potty training and doesn't seem too destructive. I would cover all cables with cord protectors, of course.

Should I crate her when I am away? Miffy is crate trained, but I don't want to crate her while I'm at work, because my work schedule is pretty unpredictable. (I'm a research assistant and some days I come home for lunch, while other days I come back late because I'm doing an experiment.)

Ideally, I'd like to make my current pen ""climb-proof,"" or find a pen that doesn't have rungs that Miffy can use to climb. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Regalo-192-Inch-Super-Wide-Adjustable/dp/B003VNKLIY/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535434158&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=baby+gate+long), but with narrower space between bars, so that Miffy can't fit through or get her head stuck in between the bars. 

Any thoughts/tips/suggestions? Thank you! :)

P.S. I am not 100% sure Miffy is a Chihuahua mix. That is just what the vet guessed, and we don't know what she is mixed with. Any guesses would be appreciated! :) We have gotten a lot of different guesses from people walking past us, including pomerianian, papillon, and even Australian shepherd!

Here are some more photos of Miffy:

1250	[BREEDS] advice about best breeds for me and my SO	" \*\*Introduction\*\* 

 1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* My boyfriend and I have both grown up with dogs. I've had one or multiple dogs for at least 20 years out of the 26 that I've been alive. That said, though, up until recently I haven't had much to do with their training; my dad took charge of that. I do have a little experience though and I've been doing a lot of reading about pet ownership and training to get prepared. 

 2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* We would love to rescue, but I think a reputable breeder my be our best option right now as this is our first dog outside of family pets and I would like to train the dog for possible service work (better explanation below).

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Calm, cuddly, responds really well to training, more on the quiet side, active enough to join me walking around town but not so active that there's guilt for not being able to keep up with the dog's energy levels, good with other animals and children

 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* I want a decent sized fluffy dog. Nothing huge, because we do live in an apartment, but medium to large. I think my preference is a Golden Retriever or Bernese Mountain Dog, although I do love pitbulls too. My boyfriend wants a Boxer eventually. We haven't quite agreed on a specific breed yet lol. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\*(I apologize for how long this answer turned out) TL;DR---need a highly trainable dog to possibly help with life, or just at home. 

 Aside from regular house training and maybe a few tricks (my brother's dog knows how to turn the lights off and I think it's the coolest little trick lol), I would like to train the dog to assist me in my daily life. 

First, let me preface this by saying that I don't necessarily know for sure that I need a Service Dog, or if an ESA would suffice instead; I still need to have a discussion with my psychiatrist and therapist to really determine what kind of assistance they believe I need. But I have chronic pain issues, Bipolar II Disorder, ADHD, and severe anxiety (bordering on OCD but that's just what my boyfriend says; my therapist hasn't actually diagnosed it yet). It's hard to say whether I need a service dog, because when I'm good, I'm great. Out the door on time, handle work well, feed and bathe myself without any issues from pain or exhaustion. But when I'm bad, it's really bad. Meltdowns that last for much longer than they should until I tire myself out or my boyfriend can snap me back to reality. I often get so overwhelmed being outside of my house that I get trapped in my car in various parking lots (by trapped I mean that I sit there for an hour, usually longer than, dissociating and struggling to find the energy to either go into the store to get my groceries or drive home). I have a difficult time bending over from chronic back pain. It isn't impossible for me to do; but I would like a dog that I can train to retrieve items for me when I'm struggling to move. I struggle with a lot of paranoia and occasional hallucinations, so being able to train the dog to determine if there is someone actually there or just in my head would mean I could actually access the rest of my house when here alone. Self-injury, while infrequent as of the last year, used to be a big struggle for me and I would like to train the dog to steer me away from that and potentially go for help if necessary. I also struggle to remember to take my meds on time (I take them regularly, just not always at the time I should and it can really mess up my routine) and I've read that dogs have a great internal clock, so I'd love to have a dog that I can train to remind me when it's time to take my medicine. 

 \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* I plan to take the dog with me as many places as possible. Training time will depend on what my doctors decide I need, but even if it will just be a pet, I plan to spend at least half an hour to an hour at the beginning working on training, and adjust that as time goes on to meet the needs of the pup.   
7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* I plan to take the dog on a walk every day, depending on what my body allows pain-wise. Goal is at least a half-hour walk, plus play time in the house and yard. If I can't do it or go as far as the dog needs, my boyfriend will step in to make sure it gets plenty of walks and exercise. We live next to a park, and there's a dog park not far from us that our friends go to and we plan to take the dog as well. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* Open to grooming at home and paying a professional for whatever we can't do. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Medium to large.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Don't mind shedding, cannot handle slobber (sensory issues), and a few barks here and there are okay but we live in an apartment and I don't want a yappy dog that will bother the neighbors or us. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* I would like for it to be trained that well, but it's not a deal breaker. 

 \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Snuggly for sure!

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? 

 \* Eager to please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?   

 \* I want the dog to be chill with strangers, as there is a big yard in front of our building that someone is always walking through or groups of kids are playing in, so I don't want it freaking out constantly due to that. My parent's dog will bark once or twice if she sees someone coming up to the door, and then runs to the window to watch, so I'd prefer to have one that responds like that. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

 \* We plan to get another dog in the future, so I would rather it not be aggressive.  

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* It can happen to any dog, but I would really prefer a breed that isn't prone to separation anxiety. Also, slobber is a huge no no (which sucks because some of the biggest slobberers are also the cutest!)

 \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

 \*Not often, my boyfriend and I work opposing shifts at the same company, so when I'm coming home, he's waking up to leave and vice versa. I plan to take the dog with me as many places as I am able, but I can see it being alone for a couple hours several times a week. If my boyfriend comes to the day shift in the future, it will be alone for up to 8ish hours a day, but I plan to come home on my lunch or hire a dogwalker if that happens. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* Our roommate prefers cats but she likes dogs too. She will feed/let it out if we aren't home for some reason. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* Roommate will likely be bringing a kitten home before we bring home a dog.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* Semi-regularly? The neighbors downstairs have kiddos and I have several neices and nephews that will occasionally be around the dog.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\*We currently live in a good size apartment, and there are no breed or weight restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* I live in Louisville, KY. As far as I know, there aren't any banned breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Average summer day is in the mid 80's, muggy and hot. Average winter day is anywhere between 20's to mid 40's, depending on what kind of winter we're having. 

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

\*My boyfriend also has mental health issues (severe depression), so there is the potential for us to end up in depressive episodes at the same time and for physical activity to greatly decline during that time, so it would probably be best to have a more laid back dog that can adapt to activity, rather than an active dog that will have to adapt to being more laid back.

1251	[HELP] Mixed labs are vicious to each other	"Hey hoomans of reddit!

My SO and I have adopted a family of mixed labs (a mother about 2 years old and her two pups guessing 6-7 months old).
The first 10 days or so went well. They eat and drink, are playful, and they enjoy running around in the backyard and so on. They know where to pee and they hardly bark. 
However until a few days ago, the pups has been fighting a lot between themselves. Not playing but actual fighting. We don’t if this is based on an incident or they’re jealous, or whatever, they’re fighting and it’s getting worse by the day. We and their mother has been breaking up their fights, however today it got out of hand: their mother ran away scared and both pups now have bleeding cuts.
I’ve now for the first time separated them into different rooms so they can calm down while were checking for other injuries. 

But should I do now? What are we doing wrong as dog owners? What could be the possible problem of this? Jealousy? 

Thank you for any advice, really appreciate it!!! "	dogs
1252	[help] Adopted a dog from another state, ended up being a totally different breed that it was listed as.	Hey everyone! I just adopted a 4 month old puppy from another state, after a delay of a month she arrived! So excited but it became very clear quickly that she was not a Lab/Heeler mix but a dachshund/cattledog/something. Shes very sweet but the main purpose of getting the dog was for intense hiking in the mountains and camping companion (I go pretty much every weekend). She has super short legs and highly doubt she will grow into them. I dont know what to do 	dogs
1253	[Discussion] Just moved from TX to PA. Dog I’ve had for years is showing intense new anxiety to cars passing by and I don’t know where to begin.	"Hi /r/dogs!

Long time reader. First time poster.

My dog Samson is a ~3.5yo pit mix that I’ve had for ~2.5 years. I have zero information on his first year of life, the shelter couldn’t even tell me if he was taken in as a surrender or a stray. I helped him gain weight and socialized him for the first time when I got him.

For practically this whole time we’ve lived in Dallas, which is a relatively new city with a lot of sprawl. We still lived in an urban area but the streets are wide and the traffic is not all that dense.

This month we moved to Pittsburgh and for a solid month he was adjusting so much more quickly than I expected. I noticed pretty much immediately that he didn’t like walking on the busier roads and that seemed reasonable so after trying a couple of times we avoided them. I live in the heart of the city but we do have an actual neighborhood with purely residential streets, so it was fine.

My street, however, is on a pretty steep incline. So cars have to accelerate. If traffic was really flowing on our street I’d take him a different way and walk him through a nearby retirement community, which he loved.

Today, however, he just refused to leave our little parking area. I tried a few times throughout the day, making sure he was relaxed and calm beforehand, with no luck. Just now we went out because he has not pooped today and a motorcycle turned down the driveway while I was trying to coax him into an alleyway (still had his harness) and he ran, full-force, away from me.

That has NEVER happened before, even with how high his anxiety was when I first rescued him. And I have absolutely no idea what changed, because this past month he has actually seemed eager to explore his new environment. I have proven capable of helping him with anxiety in the past but I’ve never witnessed anything like this in him before and feel completely out of my element.

Has anyone experienced anything similar and/or have any advice to offer?"	dogs
1254	[Help] How to tell if my dog's yeast infection is improving	"Hello all!

I recently had a very trying experience visiting family with my dog. After cutting the grass, my father sprayed weed killer without telling me. Of course, my dog has gotten used to doing his business and playing outside in ""clean"" grass, so the reaction to the weed killer was pretty bad. Red, itchy paws that scabbed over were the biggest problems. After a lot of paw soaks, allergy medicine, coconut oil and staying off the lawn for about a week, the paws are mostly under control. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that I'm seeing a brown-red stain at his nail beds which I have read is an indicator of a yeast infection that could have been brought on by his reaction to the weed killer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still rinsing paws after he goes outside and doing paw soaks, but I'm not sure how I can tell that he is getting better? Will the redness disappear or do I need to wait for it to grow out? What else can I do outside of cider vinegar soaks or diluted boric acid soaks?

Again, I've been doing these things, but don't know how to know if he's getting better or if I'll need to get help from the vet.

I'll be going soon in about a week before air travel, but always like to put my best foot (or paw) forward when seeing them."	dogs
1255	[breeds] looking for the right breed to compete in sports with.	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have raised and owned two dogs prior, first a Vizsla then a Border Terrier. I have taken care of a Labrador mix, &amp; a Boston Terrier. I have fostered a Jack Russell. I am planning to do extensive research on whatever breed I happen to decide on. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to buy a dog from a reputable breeder.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would want a dog that is medium sized (around 40-65 pounds). A versatile &amp; trainable breed would be preferable as I plan to compete with them in herding trials, agility, dock diving, &amp; obedience ( I also love teaching new tricks!) when they are old enough. I would want a breed that enjoys being around me and is affectionate.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Out of the research I've done, Border Collies (working line) &amp; Australian Cattle Dogs seem like they would be good fits as far as things go (temperament, exercise, etc). I am open to other suggestions as well. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* As I mentioned in my answer above, I would want to train my go in agility, obedience, herding trials, &amp; dock diving. I also would much enjoy teaching my dog fun tricks. Running beside my bike when full grown would be nice, but not necessary. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Usually I can spend about 7-8 hours daily with my dog. This includes training, playing, exercise, &amp; just being around me in general.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I am planning to give my dog 35-45 minutes of physical exercise, and around 30-35 minutes of mental stimulation each day.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am very much open to cleaning ears and brushing fur. I am not very open however to dogs that need their hair cut / trimmed (e.g; poodles).

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium sized breeds are my preference (around 40-60 pounds).

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle all three as long as it's the right dog.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would definitely be nice to do, but it isn't something necessary.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would love a snuggly dog. I would definitely want a breeds that is affectionate.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Definitely an eager to please breed. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind if the dog is reserved and cautious with strangers, as long as it isn't out right aggressive (e.g: snapping, snarling)

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* It wouldn't be preferable, but I'm fine with it as I have dealt with others that were dog-agressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Extreme agression, incredibly stubborn (I'm okay with the dog having a slight stubborn streak but I want a trainable &amp; eager-to-please dog )

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4-5 hours daily. As I said before, I plan to get a dog walker when it is a puppy.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. My current apartment is a 2 bedroom, and the only breed restrictions are on pit bull types.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in Toronto, Canada. Pit-bull types are banned, as I said in my above answer. These include the APBT &amp; AmStaff. If your have a dog that looks like a pit-bull (e.g American Bulldog), you have to have papers to prove that it isn't a pit bull.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Toronto has pretty much seasonal weather (it can get extremely  cold during the winter)

**Additional Information and Questions**

1257	[Help] Rear dew claw removal?	My 8 month old dog has what seems to be unattached rear dew claws and many friends and family are suggesting I get them removed.

Is it worth it to have them removed or should I risk them getting caught on something?	dogs
1258	[Help] What more can I be doing for my puppy?	"Hello!

I have a 6-month-old blue heeler named Mila. She's been a very sweet addition to the family, and is mostly a behaved pup.

I do have one big issue with her, however.

Mila was once trained to stay in my large bathroom while everyone (myself and roommates) were out of the house. This helped her get in potty training habits, etc. She had a crate that was her designated sleep space, and she relaxed in it with the gate open quite often.

When she grew a little more, we started to let her free roam for short periods of time in the house. During those short times though, she would get into all sorts of trouble rummaging through trash, chewing objects, and getting poop from the catbox.

We tried to go back to leaving her in the bathroom again until we can trust her to not destroy the house, but she chewed up the dry wall and barks relentlessly.

My roommates need to sleep, and her barking is way too loud to keep her in my bathroom where all the rooms are anymore. We also don't want more damage to the walls.

So she is now in her crate in the basement bathroom, where her barking is at least quieter.

Problem is, she freaks out as soon as she is in her crate now. This isn't separation anxiety, and boredom is more likely, but she flips out right after I or anyone else, put her in her crate.

We take her for runs at least twice a day. I run her right before putting her in her crate, to the point where she doesn't want to walk she's so tired. I give her a few minutes to go potty and drink water, then put her in her crate with a Kong full of peanut butter (special treat when she's in the crate only). The bathroom fan is on for background noise, and low lights to make it more relaxing in the bathroom.

All of this, and she still flips out. She always covers herself in drool and can't catch her breath. She doesn't even glance at her treat (we've tried others too). As soon as she's let out, she goes potty and practically passes out from exhaustion.

I don't know what else I can be doing. I want to free roam her some more, but I can't trust her to be left alone more than an hour in the house. She's so sneaky and food driven, and my roommates dont want things destroyed in the house anymore.

If there's any suggestions, please let me know! Right now all I can think to do is give her something to make her drowsy just so she can calm down.

Tl;dr my dog flips out as soon as I crate her, despite doing all the usual tips and tricks to try to help her relax"	dogs

1260	[discussion] Should I adopt my ex boyfriend’s dog?	"Hey reddit! I got a situation on my hands and could use some advice. I have an opportunity to adopt Basil, a 1 year old golden retriever. She is owned by my ex boyfriend and he has been overwhelmed by taking care of her and is planning on rehoming her. He is also moving to a home where he can’t have a dog. Our relationship ended a couple weeks ago (it was mutual, we are both sad but no hard feelings) and he is very willing to give her to me. I love this dog and she loves me. My ex boyfriend always has said that I’m her favorite person, even over him. I was very much involved in picking her out and raising her. I’ve been involved in training her and feel like I have realistic expectations as to her needs. However, there are a couple things that make this complicated:

1. I’m currently living with my parents and taking care of my dad who is dying from colon cancer. He will likely pass away in the next couple months. My parents have an older 13 lb poodle who initially got along with Basil, but got scared when Basil was more enthusiastic than he was comfortable with. I suspect they would get along over time, both dogs have adjusted well to changes in the past. It will likely add some strain to have a young dog in the house, but my family is supportive of me if I choose to adopt her.

2. My actual house that I will move back to when my dad passes away is pretty small. I live with a roommate and a cat. the yard is not fenced in, but my plan is to have her on a long line and to take her to a big park that’s next door. I live next to a nice walking trail and lots of green outdoor space. When I return to work I’ll be away for about 9 hours a day, but my roommate will be around some of that time. I’ll be able to spend 1+ hours in active time with her during the week, much more on weekends and lots of hangout time. My friends and roommate adore her, and everyone is supportive of me having her. I also live in walking distance to a brewery and coffee shop that have outdoor seating where we can hang at together.

3. Basil hates riding in cars. This has improved significantly over time. She was was bred by an Amish family that I don’t think exposed her to cars. I know that if I bring her to my parents house she will likely have to get in a car several times a week (to a dog park and maybe to doggie day care on busy/difficult days) and I’m nervous I’ll make it worse. Ex bf is working on getting anti anxiety meds from the vet.

If I decide to do this, I’ll get her in a week. My plan would be to introduce her to my parents dog in a neutral setting and keep both of them well exercised and socialized with dogs their own size. If I’m able to I’d like to take her to an obedience class, though she already knows sit, stay, touch, down, and I’ve been working on leave it. I have two coworkers who can take her for 1-2 weeks each if things get difficult.

I think she will be a wonderful help in a horrible time. Having a dog who loves me and will get me outdoors and exercising every day will be great for me. However, I’m really nervous that I won’t be good enough for her, that she’ll add stress to a difficult time, and her needs won’t be met, resulting in behavior problems. I’ve been looking for a dog to adopt for the last year or so, but always chicken out before committing. It’s a huge responsibility and I want to do it well. Maybe the smart thing is to make sure she goes to a family with kids (she adores children). I don’t want her to feel abandoned though, I want her to feel loved. I just don’t know what the right thing is right now.

What should I do? Any suggestions for making this transition easier. "	dogs
1261	[Help] Toys or games for dog that likes to run but not fetch or tug?	"Hi all,

Last week my boyfriend and I took in a 1yo-ish mutt &amp; we know essentially nothing about her past, but she came to us partially trained. She is housebroken, sleeps perfectly in a crate, knows how to sit &amp; heel (never tugs on the leash) and is eager to please to a fault. She is happiest following us from room to room and (mostly) sitting nicely for us.

I know part of this is her needing to settle and let her personality come out, but we bought some random cheap toys to see what would tickle her fancy and she seems to like chewing on softer things (tennis ball and tug rope) but as a late evening chill-play type activity. If we try to active-play with her to get her to burn some energy, the only thing that seems to get her going is running alongside us or chasing us around a tennis court. Any attempt to introduce a toy to the equation gets either totally ignored or confused looks.

This results in her not burning much energy on her own and I think that contributes to her occasional bursts of barking or jumping at us - she's too dependent on us for attention and energy burning. I'm also going to start ""capturing the calm"" exercises but I'd like to find a way to get her to play (either on her own or with us) in another way than just running back and forth.

She gets probably a collective 1.5-2 hours of walking a day. We have a fenced yard but she doesn't like to be out there without us. (this is getting better over time)

Any tips?

Thanks!"	dogs
1262	[Help] Exercising a dog without building up their tolerance, leading them to need more and more...	"Hi guys! So I feel like this is a dumb question and I'm missing something obvious...so be patient. ha!  


I've seen many posts that discuss exercising different dogs, and one thing I've seen repeated is something like, ""Well, you've been taking them on 3 hour walks every day and they're conditioned for that... it's not enough anymore."" That makes sense to me...with humans, repeating the same workout over and over makes that workout easier and doesn't leave you as worn out as it did when you started.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a 6-month-old puppy who is SO SO chill. He was extremely malnourished when found - he weighed just 10lbs and is now up to 17lbs with just a bit left to gain. I think part of that ""chillness"" is because he just didn't have the energy to do much. He'd have 30 seconds of puppy energy and then just lay down and fall asleep. He's a LOT healthier now and I've seen his energy levels increase accordingly, but he's still SUPER chill and prefers to spend more time cuddling us than running around.   


However, I love to take walks and would love to take him on long walks. He's certainly not ready for them now - we take him on about 20 minute walks now and that about exhausts him.  But when he's ready, I want to be able to build him up to longer walks.  My concern is that if I do that, he'll develop a NEED for those longer walks and lose his ""chill""/calmness. I took our old dog on 30-60 min walks 2x a day and did tons of training and brain work with him. But he became a terror if he didn't get both of those walks, and he needed longer and longer walks and more and more mental stimulation. Is there a way to have a happy  medium where the dog is okay going on longer walks (i.e. won't overtire them or hurt them physically) but doesn't NEED those walks?   


I'm overthinking this, aren't I. haha"	dogs
1263	[Help] My dog chews his paws raw and I can’t figure out how to make him stop	"Hi - I have a 14 year old Mini Australian Shepherd, neutered. We adopted him when he was 10 &amp; he’s always been incredibly anxious. He still ducks his head when my partner walks in the room, and follows me around the house from room to room. We’ve tried to make him comfortable, but with a new baby &amp; new home the last few years have been stressful for him. He’s always had a nervous habit of chewing on his paw. If we had someone new to the house, or changed his routine he’d chew his paw a little, but never this bad &amp; it would usually calm down once he got used to the change. 

We recently moved &amp; because of where we moved to, I’m away from home about an hour more a day than I used to be. I’ve noticed that he’s begun chewing on his paw to the point that it’s red under the fur. 

I feel like I’ve tried everything from longer walks in the morning before I leave, to a different kind of treat (which he seems to love), to more one-on-one time before I go to sleep. I can’t seem to calm his anxiety &amp; get him to stop gnawing at himself. 

Does anyone have any other ideas on what I could do? "	dogs
1264	[help] - vet says OK to wait to check dog's tumor, but he won't sleep	"A bit of a long story. My 13 year old goldendoodle has in the past 24 hours developed an egg sized lump on his neck under his chin. It is not bleeding, though it is red. I called my vet and and a veterinarian emergency line to ask if immediate attention was needed, but they both said if he is eating and drinking and playing as usual (which he is) then it's fine to wait until the vet has an appointment. My current vet is on vacation, and as labor day weekend is busy, the next possible appointment is only on Tuesday.

So all that's well and good except my dog seems to have difficulty sleeping. He won't rest his head on the ground (his tumor is on the bottom of his snout, and so I think that's why.) He'll lie with his head just an inch or two above the ground for long periods of time. This looks tiring. Should I bring him to an emergency vet clinic anyway? It costs more and they don't have his medical history like his normal vet does, which is why I am hesitating.  (He has many minor medical conditions, especially involving his teeth and another lipoma which might be relevant).

Any help at all would be appreciated.

1265	[Rip] Zoey, my best friend	"Zoey was an English bulldog, almost 8 years old.

She was used abused and used only for breeding until 6 years old when she could no longer breed. She was tossed out the door and found herself in the middle of nowhere.

Someone found Zoey and brought her home. They posted on Facebook saying she needs a loving home. That’s where I found her. 

I had a shepherd/husky/mix who was only a year old. I could not say no to helping at least foster Zoey until she found a home.

She was overweight and in distress, her stomach was dragging on the floor, she was dirty and would not stop heaving for air and whining.

I brought her to the vet, she was healthy. Just overweight and she had just given her last litter. Also was in distress her pups were taken from her, just like they had been all her life. 

Zoey calmed down and started to enjoy her new life. She loved food and napping! She was a lazy dog but as soon as you got near the leash she went crazy , she loved adventures.

She turned into a queen, she was a character. Napping, making funny noises, would get random bursts of energy, she was doing what she wanted.
I’ve never seen a dog with so much character. 

During our 2 years together she loved to cuddle and loved humans. Didn’t care about other dogs but LOVED humans. She would cuddle with me constantly, by my feet when I’m on the computer, by my bed when I’m sleeping and by the door when I left home. 

I left her with my parents while I went on a road trip. It was the best vacation I’ve ever had. My mother called the night before I came home and and said zoeys breathing is very loud. Not uncommon for bulldogs at all - I said I would check her out when I got home the next day.

The next day my mom said she was looking really well! I had a long drive home and to make it short - she fell asleep and never woke up. She died 3 hours before I got home. Her heart gave out. She was running around, napping, feeling fine then all of a sudden went kaput. She started to decay fast so my mom brought her to the vet before I got home.

I’m happy she passed peacefully and got to live the end of her life happily. It happened almost perfectly, I’m just really sad I didn’t get to see her one last time. Coming home from a trip excited to see her, oh the surprise. 

I live alone in a house with her and my husky (husky likes to be alone). Life has been different. There is nobody by my bed when I sleep anymore. There is nobody by my feet when I’m on the computer. There’s nobody cuddling me when I’m on the couch. 

I miss her. But at the same time I’m happy for her. "	dogs

1269	[FLUFF] Probably the best trick I ever taught my dogs	"Hello all! In August of 2015 I adopted a 7 year old mini aussie named Kassie. She was the sweetest dog pretty much ever (which is a lot for me to say because my family's goldendoddle set a really high bar). She had been abused and really did not trust anyone but me and maybe my roommate a little. Unfortunately I was visiting home and out volunteering with my mom watching her when she got scared and bolted to the door. And extra unfortunately my parents have never gotten around to fixing our screen door so it did not latch and she escaped. I came home as soon as I could but we never found her and animal control came to my house late at night with her. She had been hit by a car and did not make it. It devastated me and when I got my next dog I vowed I would do everything in my power to not let that happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I now have 2 dogs. And one of the tricks I have taught to try and prevent this was ""cross"" which is when we are crossing streets. Both of them know that the ONLY time they are allowed to cross the street is when I say it, even if I walk into the street and say ""come"". We just recently had to ""use"" this trick for the first time though (After about 2 years of teaching it to them). We were staying with my parents and my mom was going to go get the mail. Normally telling them ""stay"" and then going through the door is enough, but this time they saw dogs in the neighbors yard across the street and rushed out. Neither of them crossed the street though. They stopped about 5ft from the edge and just excitedly barked. There were no cars coming but it was nice to know they would actually remember the command when we weren't there to enforce it.

&amp;#x200B;

This wouldn't have saved Kassie because she would have done about anything to get away from people she didn't trust and I can't blame her for that. And I don't even think that it would work in all situations for my current dogs, but if it even helps for some minor situations like that it gives me a lot of peace of mind. "	dogs

After talking with the vet tech about my concerns, she took the sample in back to do a quick look and maybe determine what sort of tests need to be run.

After a couple minutes she comes back out … and asks if we have *blackberries* in my yard.

Black Berries.

Seeds and all.

Sigh, having dogs is interesting."	dogs
1273	[Help] my dog has newly developed resource guarding and just snapped at me.	"Hi guys,
 I have a 3 year old Maltese I’ve had with me since he was 6 months old. He’s grown to become a very quiet, cuddly spoiled dog with tiny bursts of energy. He’s not into tug of war kinda play, or fetch etc. He just likes to chill.

Recently though he has started developing a habit of resource guarding and it’s gotten very bad. He started by RG ONLY furry keychains or toys, and was fixated on a furry bunny keychain I had attached to my purse. Every night he would sit next to my purse and not let me near the bunny. Eventually I gave it to him, he ran under the bed and slept next to it. I was not allowed near. A few days after he forgot about the bunny and doesn’t care about it any more. 

Then this grew into guarding anything. He started suddenly guarding his “hump bear”, and sleeps next to the bear every night, and won’t let me near them. He also guards raw hide bone. Sometimes he brings the bone on my bed and then won’t let me near the bed. He growls a LOT. He once snapped at me for getting too close to him and hump bear. I leave him alone, but anyway I never ever tried to snatch anything from him. We don’t play those games. He can have what he wants and no one ever steals it. 

Tonight I found him on my bed with a bone next to him. He started growling as I came near, but I kept telling him to go away because it was my side of the bed he was on. He eventually moved, and when I sat in bed he cuddled up next to me. Then I wanted to place my hand on him as I always do, and he snapped at me and bit me. He didn’t tear any skin or anything, it just hurts. He’s been scolded and told he’s a bad dog, tied to the bed, and I’ve taken away all the bones and hump bear. 


He only does this to ME and not my mother. But I need to stop this. "	dogs
1274	[Help] What to include in a home-made diet for dogs?	"Our pup has a bunch of food allergies and got put on this prescription food from Royal Canin. The ingredients look awful, he doesn't like it, and it's over 90 dollars a bag. 

For me, for him, and for my wallet, I would like to try making him food from a variety of ingredients like chicken, rice, sweet potato, carrots, peas, apples, fish oil, etc. 

Is there a diet like this that can make up all of his needs nutritionally, or would he need to be on a multivitamin to handle this? "	dogs
1275	[Help] Taking a dog from underweight to normal weight...without becoming overweight?	"Sigh - another dumb question. I'm having a day, okay? haha

​

Our dog Tucker was super malnourished and neglected when he was discovered. He weighed about 10lbs and you could see and feel every single bone (in fact, he very nearly died from hookworm). In just the weeks since he's been in foster care (about 3 weeks) and with us (about 3 weeks) he's gotten up to about 17lbs, with 3 pounds of that happening in 1.5 weeks after all of his worms and coccidia were completely vanquished.  I think he's VERY close to being a good weight and he has an appointment next week to verify this with the vet. He has a thin layer of padding over his ribs and his bones aren't visible anymore, but you can still feel them.

We've been feeding him Royal Canin gastro puppy food at the advice of the vet because he had quite a bit of diarrhea. When that starts running low (which will probably be this week, actually) I'll start mixing in Kirkland Nature's Domain puppy food.  He gets 2 3/4 cups of the Royal Canin every day, split between three meals. We don't free feed.

​

So here's the REALLY stupid question. Once he reaches his ideal weight - will his body just stop gaining weight at that rapid pace? He's a puppy, so he still does need to gain as he grows, but how do I stop the very rapid gain and prevent him from getting overweight?  Our previous puppy gained about a pound a week about from birth until he hit about 26lbs at 8 months, and then the growing slowed significantly, and I expect Tucker will be fairly similar.  Do I need to do anything to make sure he's gaining just the appropriate amount of weight or will his body naturally regulate his size?"	dogs
1276	[Help] Labored breathing, not eating, vet is unconcerned?	"Didn't realize this was gonna be long so I'll leave this up top-

(way) TLDR; my slightly overweight 11 yr old dog has been breathing heavily, not eating, on and off lethargic. Doctor is unconcerned every time we bring it up, saying she's just old or hot. Concerned, but don't want to visit the vet again for something the vet doesn't see as an issue.

​

​

I have an 11 year old ACD/German Shepherd mix that I'm a little worried about. It's the family dog but I've been away from home for a few years so I haven't been extremely present in her life recently. Both my parents are very disabled so she hasn't been getting that much exercise lately since I'm gone. She's overweight, nothing that the vet is super concerned with. She has always been super active and energetic in the past.

​

I've just moved back home so I've been trying to exercise her as much as possible but I'm not sure how much she can do because she's old and has been breathing weird.

For a while we've noticed her breathing really heavily, even when inside with the air conditioner and when she hasn't been playing or outside. Especially at night.

​

We've brought this up to the vet almost every time we go, which is fairly frequently. They just say she's just hot, or she's old, but they are never concerned when we bring it up. I'm not sure if it's just a weight issue or something more that they're not investigating? But it just seems so not normal.

​

She's also pretty weird with food. She usually is excited when dinner time comes, although she doesn't always finish everything. But some days she just doesn't eat. Even when we know she must be hungry.

​

Also, a little over a year ago she had emergency surgery for a ruptured benign tumor on her spleen. She recovered pretty well from it. Unsure if that's related to any issues she may be having now.

​

​

That's an issue she's having today. Didn't eat yesterday or today, been very lethargic and seemingly sad, breathing heavily, can't jump up on the bed (which she usually can do, even though she requires a running start these days). She was home alone with my mom for a while before this but she says she was with her the whole time and didn't get in to anything.

​

​

I want to take her to the vet, but it just seems like we ALWAYS take her with these concerned and they never think anything of it. We just can't afford to keep pressing these issues that the vet isn't concerned with even though they really freak us out. We just haven't been getting and different opinions so it seems like a waste to try and investigate further, ya know?

Is she really just that old? Is it just because of her weight? I've seen much more overweight dogs that seem not to struggle as much. I dunno. And since she's older I'm scared to overwork her since she already breathes so heavily when resting.

​

I'm just curious if anyone has some insight or input. I know this isn't a replacement for in person veterinary advice, but at this point I'd love some outside views."	dogs

1278	[HELP] new dog obsessed with cat	"On 4th of July I rescued a small dog off the streets after I saw her almost hit by a car. Couldn't find an owner in the community near by so I took her home. Took her to the vet, she was healthy but no chip. We tried to find the owner but no such luck. I'm kind of a sap so we ended up keeping her! I already have a cat and my boyfriend has a dog. That cat and dog aren't friends by any means but they leave each other alone and can be near each other without problem - they are used to each other by now. The new dog, however, is OBSESSED with the cat. Endless barking and chasing. She shakes and stares at the cat any time she sees him. Over time, we've got her to bark less (she's a bit of a yip yap dog), but she still can't leave him alone. The cat is annoyed but doesn't do anything except the occasional swipe when the dog is literally on top of him and he feels threatened. He has no ill will towards the new dog, just wants to be left alone by him. I miss my cat! He is always in hiding and when I try to give him attention, the new dog will jump and whine and endlessly try to get at the cat. I think she's concerned for my safety, I don't know. I just want to be able to cuddle with my cat sometimes. I'm new to owning a dog, I don't know anything about training. My boyfriend doesn't really know much about training either, he just raised his dog since she was a premie so she listens to him and has a great personality in general (just jumps a lot which my boyfriend doesn't care about). Can anybody help me figure out how to bring some more harmony into this house with all the animals?

​

If this is helpful: The cat is a male, 5 years old, Abyssinian mix, great personality (almost like a dog, very affectionate and gives kisses), but he hides most of the time now (he's normally very social). Only is aggressive with the dog when he feels threatened but doesn't really attempt to hurt her, just defends himself.

My boyfriends dog is about 5, some sort of terrier breed (I'm not great at knowing breeds), also a great personality, but joins in with the chasing with the other dog to get in on the fun. Normally leaves the cat alone. She's really smart. She can open bags, even (I didn't know this until after she got into a backpack and found some chocolate....). Like I said earlier, my boyfriend doesn't really know much or care much about training.. I think she would respond well to it though (I'm annoyed at the jumping when my daughter who is 4 comes home from school because the dog always jumps on her and is big enough for it to be a bit of a problem)

The new dog is a very small dog, about 8 pounds and white short soft hair. Maybe some sort of terrier/poodle/Chihuahua mix? I honestly have no idea. She's about 2 or so (the vet's guess). She's a very cute sweet dog, it's just the barking (which is better now, she used to non stop bark at him) and the obsession with the cat that's the problem. No matter how many times I take her away, push her away, try to separate them, she is relentless. She's kind of dumb, doesn't really learn. She is a cute though. My daughter loves her, and the dog puts up with her trying to carry her around all the time (my daughter keeps getting in trouble for this because I'm afraid she'll her the small dog on accident but the dog is very sweet with her and just lets it happen)

They are all neutered/spayed.

Any help is appreciated! I'm a blank slate when it comes to training dogs! Something needs to change!"	dogs
1279	[Fluff] My rescue is (finally) successfully loose-leash walking!	"Just wanted to post a bit of ""Monday motivation""! I have to admit I held off on making a happy post in case it was a fluke... 

For context, he's a 55 pound 1 year old Australian Shepherd so... he has virtually no impulse control and a bigger stubborn streak than I do, which until I met him I did not believe exists. You have to believe I was at my wit's end with him many times! 

There were many walks we came back from when I was so frustrated I felt like crying. I am a 120 pound woman and he has a high prey drive. My neighborhood is full of rabbits and squirrels so his ""choke myself while sprinting full-speed for a block and a half"" routine was... rough. For a while I thought I might as well schedule a shoulder surgery now because I didn't think that joint was ever going to be the same after owning him. 

The first time he walked with the leash loose was the beginning of last month. We were walking and I was a bit distracted and do you know how I realized he wasn't pulling the leash? I genuinely thought he slipped his collar and made a break for it. I had been walking for half a block without looking at him because I was exhausted and out of it, and then I just got hit with this intense fear that I lost him because I couldn't feel pressure on the leash. I stopped dead and glanced down and then the fool just stood there looking up at me with these big eyes like ""Why did we stop?"" and so I apologized to him and kept walking, a bit stunned. 

And naturally kept my eye on him the rest of the way. I literally cried happy tears when he just trotted next to me for the whole four blocks home. I was convinced it wasn't real, but now at the end of August I can say that, while he does have bad days, almost every walk we go on is a good walk! He is so smart and leashes were his only bad manners but they were so bad it was almost a deal-breaker, so I am immensely grateful he apparently learned/respects me enough to behave.

I have no idea what to tell anyone struggling with this, because one day he was an absolute terror and the next day he was perfect and has been consistently good since, just like a switch flipped. But I just wanted to say there is hope :) don't give up on your heavy pullers! I had to buy a leash with an extra handle for mine and lose a bit of sanity every day but he is nailing it now! We do occasionally still struggle with squirrels but considering I've only been working with him since April I am ecstatic and now very hopeful that by the time he's a full adult he will be normal. (He's an Aussie though so... it'll stay interesting I'm sure).

PS. I have no idea how to include video or anything on Reddit but here is a link to a gif of the first time he walked properly :) I had to capture it because I was certain I was hallucinating. https://gph.is/2BQL6rZ

1282	[discussion] The other day at work, my boss told me that when a dog hears another dog cry out as if it’s in pain/dying, its first instinct is to kill the injured dog to put it out of its misery. In all my years working with dogs I’ve never heard or witnessed anything like this. Is it true?	"One of the dogs at my work became tangled in a lead and screamed because he was panicking. Another dog immediately lunged at him to attack him and my boss said the above when I asked why he’d do that. I have plenty of experience with dogs and usually when something like that happens the other dogs will crowd anxiously around it and whine. I’ve never seen one attack. However, my boss has much more experience than I do and I trust his expertise so I’d never just write it off; instead I thought I’d ask here. Is this really a thing? If it matters, the attacking dog was a lab and tends to be very anxious but not usually aggressive. 

Edit: forgot to mention, both dogs are fine and no one was injured! My boss got the aggressor off and calmed them both down fine. I don’t know what happened afterwards to the aggressor dog but haven’t seen him since. "	dogs
1283	[Breeds] What breed would work for me?	"Hello all!

I have been dying to get a dog for years after growing up with several family dogs throughout my life I finally feel I might be able to get a dog now that I am done with college, had a full time job for a few years and now buying a house! I have pasted the questionnaire below.

The TLDR; version is that:

* I am moving into a new 2 story house with my wife and her little dog (12lb Chihuahua/Terrier type mix).
* I want a dog more suited to me that is medium-large and family friendly who likes to play but will be ok left alone at the house most of the weekday while we are at work with just the other dog for company.
* Most dogs I am interested in dont seem to be great left alone but I'm not sure how much the other dog will help. A few that I like are : Golden Retreiver, Golden Doodle, German Shepard, Belgian Tervuren, Finnish Lapphund, Husky (and its smaller versions) but open to several other breeds to make things work.

See below for all the details.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have had several family dogs throughout my life of different sizes. This will be my first as a primary owner though

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue is better but I will prioritize the right type of dog for me over where it comes from

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, affectionate, likes to play some when I am home, doesn't require too much exercise, and is content with staying at home with just another dog during the day as my wife and I work full time.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Golden Retreiver, Goldendoodle, Chow Chow, greyhound. Open to suggestions but I would prefer a friendly medium-large sized dog. LOVE Huskies but I dont think I can leave them alone during the day. Maybe a Pomski or Klee-Kai would be ok being left alone with another dog though.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basics - potty training, sit, shake, lay down, roll over, fetch, leash training.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Probably an hour of real exercise in the afternoon on a job or bike ride and some more general playing in the house on weekdays.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1 hour per weekday and multiple on weekends. Plan to visit the multiple dog parks nearby as well.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Open to either. The less the better but I could take a few minutes each day or longer grooming weekly.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The less the better but I can handle it all.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not much. It would be nice to walk to the mailbox without a leash but I can't imagine many times this would be helpful.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly is great but if more personal space means they're more ok being left at home during the workday with just another dog I am happy with that too.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either. I am getting a dog to spend time with it but would be happy if it didn't need me for 100% of everything

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking with a stranger knocking or entering my yard but greet anyone who enters my home while I am around politely.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I cannot because we will have another smaller dog

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* anything that will tear up the house while I am away or attack our smaller dog

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Wife and I care for her smaller dog but we both would like a medium-large dog for him to be friends with and that I can play fetch with

1284	[Help] Looking to buy my first puppy. Either a Purebred GSD or a Puremixed GSD+Lab Retriever or a Puremixed GSD+Rotty or a Puremixed GSD+Pitbull. Willing to go to dog-training courses myself, as well taking my dog w/ me to dog school once I get it. Which breed should I get out of the above?	"Also some additional questions if you don't mind:

1. Except internet resources, books, and a dog-training course, what else can I do to maximize my capabilities as a dog owner before I actually purchase the dog?
2. Is it better to get a puppy from birth or to buy a puppy that's already potty trained and knows to sit and what not?
3. How can I guarantee the dog will be as the seller claims? Is marketing something as purebred or puremixed a government-regulated thing, or is there some certificate of authenticity that guarantees my dogs' breeding is as the seller advertises? For example, I want 50/50 if I get a puremixed dog, not 25/75 as I read online are often sold as puremixes.
4. Including medical costs for the puppy, as well as taking it to dog school to have it potty-trained and learn to sit and stuff (unless buying a pretrained puppy is cheaper), how much would I have to pay for one? Is 10k USD enough?
5. Apparently there are Working-Pedigree Lines and Show-Strain Breeds... are these government-regulated/certified labels, or are they unregulated? I don't want show-strain, I want the working-pedigree lines.

Thanks."	dogs
1285	[Help] Dog is afraid to come inside	A few months ago my dog started to bark early in the morning to be let out. Like 4am early. Then she just wouldn't come in. At night we couldn't get her inside, and at one point said screw it, we'll just leave her outside. This wasn't a problem because we put her crate out there and it was still warm during the night. Now that it's getting colder, she still won't come inside,instead preferring to lay outside on the grass shivering away. It even rained once and she got soaked but still wouldn't come inside! When she is inside she starts shaking and barks to go outside. I'm concerned for when it gets really cold and am at a loss for what to do. We think it's just that she's pretty old (13-14). We think she's a German pointer cross with a beagle. I can't seem to think that we changed anything with the inside of the house to make her so against it.	dogs

1287	[Help] Our dog had his front leg amputated Friday and it’s infected, now a hole that appeared is getting bigger.	"His leg was amputated due to a bad break that eventually led to an infection under the splint along with loss of circulation. He had been taking antibiotics prior to the amputation due to the discovery of an abscess near the edge of his splint by the armpit.  The surgery took place on Friday, we picked him up Saturday.  He continues on the same antibiotics. The vet told us he should have minimal to no drainage and we were given instructions about monitoring the incision 2x a day, with one of the symptoms to monitor being “watch for drainage.” Well, later that night after picking him up, he started to have lots of drainage with a foul odor. We took him back first thing in the morning, and they told us there was a hole near some necrotic tissue that needs to continue draining. In other words, our job was just to prevent a scab from forming, let the wound continue to drain, and continue his meds as ordered. Anyway, wiping away the drainage is a nightmare. It’s excruciatingly painful for him, and he literally drips everywhere in his kennel. His whole kennel smells like an infection, and keeping it clean is nearly impossible due to the constant dripping of stinky drainage. Today, during a routine attempt at cleaning the hole (with chlorhexidine solution given to us at the vet), I noticed it had gotten bigger and the drainage has not reduced at all. I’m very concerned about this. Does anyone know if this draining hole is “ok” like they make it seem to be at the vet? It is not near the incision like a dehiscence, it’s a random hole in the center of his tissue. They are making it seem as though his antibiotics will do the trick, but I’m not seeing progress. We’re taking him back tomorrow, but I’m afraid we will get instructed the same thing, and we aren’t provided very good rationales by the nurses and techs and it makes me feel uneasy. I just can’t believe he’s supposed to have an open draining hole that makes a huge stinky mess, and all we can do is try and wipe it regularly while avoiding getting our hands bitten? 

For the record he’s a small mutt, something chihuahua mix. He’s taking gapapentin and vetprofen for pain, simplicef is his antibiotic. "	dogs

1289	[fluff] The 'subtle' snort of frustration	"My rescue puppy (five months-ish) has been with us a week but she's picking stuff up super quickly. 

She is not allowed in the bedroom. She knows this. When I go into the bedroom she sneaks up after me and waits outside, ""stealthily"". If she hears me coming to the door she'll run back downstairs to wait innocently at the bottom. 

Tbh this wasn't as subtle as she thought it was anyway... and  now I don't know if she thinks I'm completely deaf, but she's taken to pressing her snoot at the bottom of the door and snorting/sighing very loudly in impatience if I take more than two minutes getting changed. Same deal when I'm peeing. It's so funny I burst out laughing every time and she startles away from the door.

1290	[Discussion] [help] 4 month catahoula is dog aggressive	I just recently adopted a 4 month old catahoula. He is a good dog at home and is very loving and smart. However when I take him for a walk or to the dog park he constantly grows and barks when he sees other dogs. I took him to meet my girlfriends dog who is very dog friendly and he was growling barking and even snapped once but he eventually became cool with him. Another time I was walking him and a stranger tried to let my mom meet his after I was talking to him and my dog snapped once again. He was even growling and barking at a 9 week old puppy. I'm just wondering if he could trained to stop this habit or if it's just his instinct and if it will just get worse cause that is what I have read about catahoulas. This is an important issue cause I live in a apartment complex with many other dogs around us. (I know catahoulas need lots of exercise I have been taking him out on runs and outside alot)	dogs

1292	[help] worms? deworming side effects? anal glands? or something else altogether....?	"Hey y'all, looking for a little guidance w/r/t my boy Buster. I'm aware the only way to get a conclusive answer is to see the vet, but I thought it could be helpful to start here so I can maybe figure out if I need to see the vet, like, yesterday-- or if it's a 'wait and see' kind of a deal. Fwiw I'm a new dog owner and I've only had my lil buddy since June so I'm still learning. 

Buster is a 12yo chihuahua mix rescue, neutered, cute as heck. In early July I noticed him scooting and chewing on his bum-- I figured his anal glands needed expressed, the vet confirmed that and expressed them, and he seemed back to normal after that. About 3 weeks ago I noticed him scooting and biting again. I noticed rice-looking stuff in his stool, realized he had tapeworms, gave him tapeworm meds, and the segments stopped appearing. However-- he's still been scooting and biting and his tummy has been looking bloated on and off. This led me to believe he might have other types of worms, so last Wednesday I gave him an OTC broad spectrum dewormer (Bayer Quad Chewable Dewormer, if it matters).

He seems a bit more comfortable, his stomach has been less bloated, and he's eating again-- but he's still biting and chewing at himself and yesterday I noticed hair in his stool. He doesn't appear to have any of the symptoms of bloat other than, ya know, the bloat itself so I don't THINK it's that. But I also know it's a very serious illness so maybe I should have him checked out ASAP? Is there a chance his body is still processing the dewormer and flushing out the worms? Is biting/chewing ever a side effect of that? Is it possible his anal glands could be full AGAIN, just 5ish weeks after they were expressed by the vet?

Basically: how worried do I need to be?

[edit: his diet is Taste of the Wild dry food with a small amount Taste of the Wild wet food mixed in. He gets 2 meals a day. He always has fresh water available. It's possible I do sometimes overindulge with treats... but I don't *think* his diet would be a contributing factor to his anal glands filling up so quickly]"	dogs
1293	[Help] Crate Training - Puppy peeing in her crate	"I'm in the process of trying to crate train my dogs (Puppy is 15 weeks at a guess, the older dog is 1yr,9mths) 

The issue is that my puppy keeps weeing in her crate. I have placed blankets over the crates, and beds inside, both crates are the right size for the dogs and I feed all of their meals and treats in the crate. 

 I am still in the process of trying to housetrain the puppy. She still isn't asking to go out so I try to preempt her going to the loo by taking her out regularly. 

This morning I let them out for the loo, fed them their breakfast, loo again. Then I put clean bedding in the crate (since the Puppy had wee'd on them) and she went into her crate and wee'd in there... it hadn't even been an hour since she was last let out and she hadn't asked at all to go out and I didn't catch her sniffing as she usually does when she's thinking about going. 

I picked up the bedding and have soaked it in enzyme cleaner (as I did the last time)...I took them out for the loo before heading out, and when I got back 2 hours later there were no slip ups... I checked the crate and there was a wee on the bedding....

I just don't know how to make it so she won't want to pee in her crate. I spray enzyme cleaner on anything she pees on so I don't feel like it smells of wee. She is a rescue and stank of urine when we got her so I have a feeling she wad used to peeing in her cage and sleeping in it - is crate training still viable? What can I do to address this issue? 

Thanks!

1295	[Help] Putting my dog down	"(Not a native speaker, sorry in advance)

I'm going through a hard time right now and I need some help and guidance.

So, my 13 y/o dog (Lab/Samoyed mix) has been through many things the last couple of months. She started coughing a few months ago, what we first thought to be kennel cough. After she had been coughing for two months, we took her to the vet. He listened to her heart and lungs and didn't find anything out of the ordinary. She continued with the coughing, so we took her again and took a blood test, which showed signs of inflammation. And so, in the last few weeks she's been on antibiotics.

Another problem she's been having is a decline in her appetite. It started a few weeks ago, when she didn't seem interested in her food. We though she didn't like her food anymore and we bought her wet food, so she could eat something until we can buy her new dry food. She loved it, however, she wasn't very interested in the new dry food as well. She would still eat sometimes, even though she would skip a few meals here and there.

In the last two week, her appetite has decreased drastically. Furthermore, she has been vomiting and having diarrhea. The vet suspected a virus, and he gave her injections against vomiting and diarrhea, and gave us pills against it as well. We have been giving her a few of these pills (Most of the times we couldn't because she's struggling like hell), and the antibiotics simultaneously.

In the last few days, however, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. She stopped vomiting for the most, but she hasn't eaten since Thursday, and she doesn't even want her wet food anymore. In the last few days we offered her bread and salami which she usually loves, but she's not willing to eat anything but pastrami. She didn't go for a walk for days - we tried to take her but she's reluctant to move. This morning we found her covered in her own urine. We stopped giving her either of the pills because it doesn't seem like she can go through anything anymore.

The vet gave us pills that should increase appetite, but she's struggling so hard and we can't make her take one. He and my dad believe that it's the end, and to be honest, I'm not so optimistic as well.

She's still listening to us, greets us, moves around a bit and eats pastrami when I offer her. However, she's barely eaten anything since Thursday, almost everything she does is sleeping, she's breathing deeply and panting. She's always been a chubby dog, and now she's lost so much weight that I can feel her bones.

I don't know if that's what we should do, if those are the signs that she's suffering and should be put down, if it's a mistake, if there's something more we can do. But in the same time she's been through so much already, and if those are in fact her finale days, I don't want her to suffer any more. And if the vet thinks that her lack of appetite is a sign she should be put down, I'd think that he knows what he's talking about.

I'm confused and scared, and I'm so sad. It seems impossible to even think about it, but if she's in pain it must be done. So please, I'd love to hear your guys' input. I just need some guidance, to clear things up, and maybe a little emotional support, because I can't imagine my life without her.

1297	[Discussion] Questions re: Coat Color Genetics, Specifically Types of Merles	"To start off with, I hope this isn't annoying to post. I have done quite a bit of reading online (have hit up all the main color genetics sites) and did a cursory search on this subreddit before posting.

I have a husky thing (very high %) that has a very unusual color pattern, and I haven't really been able to figure out what exactly is going on with her coloring and markings. I know from coat color genetics websites that \[[huskies and many northern breeds in general have some strange characteristics](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/albino.html#husky)\], and that terminology a/o the actual genes that cause certain visual results can vary breed by breed.

My dog is what I would describe as ""cream"" or ""fawn"" colored, with urajiro (?) markings and a dark saddle. She's very similar to the Saddleback dogs \[[at this link](https://www.huskycolors.com/rescue.html)\] — darker than the white dog but not as saturated as the reddish dog.

Anyway, what makes her unusual is that she's also a merle. The merle pattern is restricted to the saddle area, and when I saw a photo of her for the first time, I thought it was blue merle. Similar to a Dunker, for example. But upon meeting her in person, I realized that the ""grey"" areas of what seemed to be blue merle are actually just black tipped hairs blending with her cream colored undercoat.

I know that there are many different ""colors"" of merle, like blue, red, sable, etc etc. But I'm not really sure what hers would be called. At one point I thought sable merle, but was told that she's a ""black and tan"" dog, and that's mutually exclusive with sable. Would she potentially fall under the umbrella of agouti merle?

​

1299	[Help] Crate training regression	"I adopted my dog about two months ago. He’s a year and a half old mix. 

We started crate training about a week after adopting him. He took to it pretty quickly, sprinting in when he heard me open the treat bag. As of the last week, he’s started refusing to go in his crate. I think he knows that it means we’re leaving. He used to cry a bit when he’d first go in but then settle down. Now he won’t go near it. He won’t take a treat from me if I’m sitting by it. 

Crating while we’re out of the house is important since he eats fabric and trash when left alone. He also has accidents when left out of the crate. 

I don’t want to force him into the crate since that won’t help the situation, but leaving him out isn’t an option since it’s unsafe for him. "	dogs

1301	[Help] [Discussion] Vaccinations?	"Hello dog lovers

I have been lurking around this page for a while and have seen lots of interesting thoughts and ideas, so I thought the community might be able to help me.

I currently look after dogs in my spare time. It's not a career type deal but I love the companionship of the animals and as I can't work at the moment it's been really great for me and the pups too!

I have a regular customer who's 4 year old German Shepherd loves to come and stay with me and I absolutely adore having her. However the owner has never, and refuses to vaccinate her saying that it's pointless because she rarely comes in contact with other dogs and she doesn't need them anyway as she's no longer a puppy. As far as I can tell, she's a happy, healthy, energetic dog and although I have mentioned it, it's not really my place to tell the owner how to take care of her pet - she is not abused and seems to be well looked after. 

I suppose my question really is how damaging is it to the dog having not ever been vaccinated? My dogs have always been vaccinated as puppies and had boosters every three years or so. I don't know if this is something I should bring up with the owner again or not? I'm so attached to this dog and I really want what is best for her. What should I do?"	dogs

1303	[Help] House Training Step Backwards	"  

  It appears as though my dog has taken a step backwards in the house training department. He’s a 5 year old German Shepherd/Staffie cross and have had him since he was a puppy. We started him off in a crate and he would happily sleep in there and make no mess at all. He could hold it all throughout the night and do his business when we let him out in the morning. We then trusted him with having free reign of downstairs whilst we slept and, again, no issues until we would let him out as soon as we were up. 

  Then things have strangely taken a step backwards. He had both types of accident in the living room recently and we put it down to a one off but this has continued every morning since. His stool is normal, no diarrhea and his urine seems normal. He is an extremely soft, loving dog but now he refuses to sleep in his crate at night and, worryingly, he growls when we try and coax him in there. He has never shown this kind of behavior before. If we are successful and manage to get him to sleep in his crate then he makes no mess whatsoever.

She doesn’t seem to mind (mouthing the other dogs, consistently playing with these dogs and not fighting at all). She is about 2 we think, and was spayed a month ago while she was in heat (before I had her- not involved in that decision). Is it bad that I let it continue? I watch diligently to be sure it doesn’t turn into any hostility or aggression. Male dogs never seem to care, only female dogs and she is ALWAYS on the bottom. Why might this be???

1309	[Fluff]Some happy memories of my girl in Heaven.	"My dog, a chocolate Labrador named Oona, passed away just over a year ago at the ripe old age of 16. I've been reflecting on her as of late, and I thought I'd share some happy memories I have of her.

For one, she was SO smart. Probably too smart for her own good, really... Most people expect Labs to be these big dumb happy dopes, and while she was certainly a happy dog, she wasn't one of those Labs. There was one time where she was hungry and my mom didn't seem to understand that, so she went downstairs, tore off the label of her dog food bag (ironically the part that said ""dog food""), and then went back upstairs and showed it to my mom. My mom got the message after that!

Also, she seemed to understand the concept of witnesses. If she wanted to be naughty, she almost always waited until every human was away or asleep. Once she knew she wouldn't actually be caught in the act, only then would she raid the garbage can. She wasn't one of those dogs that would just wait until you weren't looking either- she'd actually wait until you weren't there. Also, she spent the latter half of her life at my dad's house, where she wasn't allowed on the couch. So what she'd do was wait until everyone was asleep and THEN jump on. And if you woke up in the middle of the night and saw her, she'd give you a dirty look before taking her sweet time to get off, and jumping right back on when you left.

Also, she had an iron stomach. She would eat literally almost anything. Socks, napkins, and she unfortunately even liked to panty raid on occasion. When we got her her past owners said she had a sensitive stomach- that wasn't true. Sure, she'd throw up sometimes, but that certainly didn't stop her... One time she ate what must have been 5 pounds of raw tuna and threw it all up in my room. That was fun to clean up... Also, there was a time when she got into a guest's suitcase and ate two whole chocolate bars, wrappers and all. She didn't even get sick!

Anyways, just thought I'd reminisce about my best friend... miss you Oona &lt;3"	dogs

1311	[fluff] she stayed!	"Today was very exiting. We had a real-live “stay” situation where we needed her to stay for her own safety and she did it! 

My boyfriend and I were doing yard work on our property today which involved a lot of lugging things back and forth with a tractor. Our pup is pretty tractor savvy by this point, and there is always at least one person supervising/handling dogs (there are 4 on the property) while someone drives it. Today though was just me and BF, and at one point he needed me to hold back a branch so he could drive under it. I knew I couldn’t manage our pup and do this, so I called her over to about 10 ft away and told her “stay.” AND SHE STAYED. Stood perfectly still and watched me back away (I always back away still so I can make sure she’s staying and grab her if she doesn’t), watched me hold the branch, watched BF drive the tractor under it and up the hill, and when I said “okay, let’s go” followed me calmly up after him. 

We’ve practiced stay inside and any time I need to leave through the front gate and don’t want her following me, but today was the first time we’ve had to do it in a real-life situation like this. I honestly wasn’t sure she would do it, as she’s 8 months and doesn’t always listen perfectly, but it was like she immediately understood what was happening and what I needed her to do.

1314	[help] How to give medicine to a dog that hates it?	"So I have to give my dog medicine. It's liquid, and has to be administered daily.

In the beginning it went okay-ish, she'd put up a little bit of a struggle, but accepted it, knowing that there'd be a treat waiting on the other end. 

However, she's getting worse and worse, to the point where I have to hold her down and physically open her jaws to squirt the 0,5 ML of liquid. I am sure it tastes like hell, so there is really no other way... however with her behaviour, I have to find a better way, or I fear it escalates to growling/snapping soon.

I've tried the ""mix in the food"" thing, doesn't work - she detects the smell immediately, and does not touch that food.

Any other good suggestions?"	dogs

1316	[Breeds] He’s not a labx at all!	"A few months ago we adopted an adorable guy we named Willie. So far he’s been a great addition to our home! 

We got him from a Rescue as a lab mix! And it totally felt like he had to be. Strangers would come up and complement us on our adorable lab puppy. My money was he was mostly lab and golden retriever, he looks like the picture if you google lab golden puppy. 

Well we got the test back and - he’s neither. Nada, nothing of what we thought. 

According to the test he’s chow chow, pit, huskie, and cocker spaniel. Also they added “mixed breeds”.

What’s interesting is my friends sister has a dog that looks like a slightly larger version of him. Supposedly that dog is half lab half Great Dane (the size makes that believable). However if you told me they were littermates I’d buy it. 

At the end of the day it doesn’t matter, he’s a good dog. But if you’re thinking of doing a test, I’d say go for it. I wish I had started a betting pool. 

I’m on my phone but I’ll try and add a picture later. "	dogs

1318	Having trouble adjusting to dog number two. [Help]	"A few days ago, the shelter where we adopted our first pup posted a found dog, who seemed like an excellent fit for our family. He was tested for friendly with kids and cats and other dogs, and met some of our other criteria. We did a meet and greet with our first dog, they got along well, and we brought him home this morning. 

About our first pup - she’s my heart dog. Truly. She’s... perfect. She is incredibly well behaved, active but a good snuggler once she is tired, she rarely barks, she’s just a little weird, and she is the softest, fluffiest dog I’ve ever known. She’s my whole world. We were together a lot during the day, lots of trips to parks, and when we were home we would just snuggle. For perspective, I cried every day the first week we had her, and once a month or so for a few months after that. 

But we really wanted another dog so she could have someone to play with. So we adopted number two.

He’s a good boy. He needs some work - he barks, he was humping, he doesn’t want to go outside but once we get him out he doesn’t want to come in. We’d like to crate train him like our first dog but he fights going in. (Basically he doesn’t want to go anywhere). I know these are all things that can be overcome. But I just... I don’t know. It doesn’t feel right yet. I loved being just me and my heart dog. I thought I was ready. 

Any advice for adjusting to accepting our second dog, and dealing with possible second thoughts?"	dogs
1319	[help] neighbor leaves dogs outside 24/7	"I recently moved to a new house and the neighbors across the street have two pit bulls. One is a smallish, older female and the other is a large, young male. My neighbors leave their dogs outside at all times. 

The female one is very sweet, and usually is on a long leash so she can go use the bathroom and get food/Water. The male has been in a cage that is way too small, all day long. I’m guessing they don’t get along or something since it seems like they need to be separated at all times. At night he gets put on the leash, while the female is put inside. He barks at almost everything, which can wake me up in the middle of the night and early in the morning. 

We’ve called the cops 3-4 times about him being in the tiny cage without access to food or water or bathroom. Cops have done nothing. I’ve seen the cop talk to the owners and nothing has been done. 

At times the owners let the male off leash and he just runs wildly through the neighborhood and up onto our yard/porch. Once I thought it was a mistake and brought the dog back to their door, and the girl bitched me out...even though I genuinely thought their dog got out by accident. He hasn’t shown that he’s super aggressive, but he does growl and bark when you get close to their house. We have a female Aussie-mix who does not really get along with other dogs, and it is quite scary when we’re trying to take her on a walk or to the bathroom and this pit bull just runs right up to us who is double her size. He seems like he just wants to play, but I am just wary of pit bulls after hearing many stories about other dogs getting hurt. 

We’ve tried calling the cops when the dog is off-leash, and nothing is done besides putting the dog back in it’s tiny cage—which btw in my state is illegal for a dog to be in a cage without adequate food or water, and it’s also illegal for a dog to be off-leash and out of control. Is there anything else I can do? I worry for the dog’s well-being, as well as my dog’s well-being. I’ve been trying to get animal control out but the police always just say they will handle it."	dogs

1324	[Help] New Job; Deciding What's Best for My Old Girle	"Hello,


I just accepted a job offer across the country (I'm in Atlanta; the job is in Seattle) where I will be living apart from my husband for 8 months. We agreed I'd take our 16 (17 in November) year old three-legged chihuahua with me to help assuage any loneliness. I've had this girl since she was born and I was in sixth grade so I'm also very attached to her.


There is a not-insignificant chance that she will pass away while I'm alone in Seattle. We're mentally preparing for that possibility (her father passed away this last February, days short of being 17.5, and it was naturally very devastating for us).


What I've only just begun considering (I haven't wanted to before) is if the flight (going to have her in the cabin with me but I worry her bladder may not make the whole flight and I've been reading that it's not advisable to give your dog a sleeping pill for flights), the new home, and her being alone for large swaths of the day is the right thing for her. At the moment, my husband is only in school, so one of us is home most of the week with her. 


I feel strongly that I owe it to my girl to be there with her and spoil her to the end, just as I did for her father. I feel some semblance of relief that the company I will be working for has a dog-friendly office and I can bring her with me, but I also worry that the exposure to people, to new places, and new stimuli (she's always been a homebody and has her favorite people) may be too stressful for her. She usually won't eat or drink water if we take her to a friend's house, so she doesn't seem to like going to new places.


My mom, who is kind of a co-owner of her (she got her parents for us/herself and they had puppies which we kept. I began taking care of her and her father about 6 years ago as my mom was going through a lot) has offered to take care of her. My mom and I are tied for the honor of Cookie's Favorite Person, with my husband being a very close second, so I don't think Cookie would mind.


However, I feel sad about the idea (however unrealistic) that I gave my dog up in order to take a job. And I'd be devastated to hear of her passing without having been there for her or seeing her one last time (it's likely that I'd travel to Atlanta every other month for a weekend if she stayed in Atlanta. Otherwise, my husband would be visiting us every month in Seattle since I want to minimize traveling with Cookie).


I'm not quite sure what to do. I feel that the trip would maybe be less stressful than her just seeing me less and less. And the companionship would be nice during the time I'm alone. But I also, above all, want to do the best thing for her in her old age. I just don't know what that could be.


Any insight or thoughts would be incredibly helpful. This has been tumbling around my mind for weeks now."	dogs

1327	[Help] Really struggling with my dog's separation anxiety. Should I consider rehoming?	"I've had my dog Whiskey for five years. He was a rescue from a municipal pound where he was housed from the ages of 3 to 9 months - I believe that is the root of his severe separation anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I adopted him, the foster family said he was great when left home alone - they didn't realize because they had 3 other dogs to occupy him during the day. His first night in my apartment, he tore it apart. I spent the next few months attempting to crate train him, but no matter how slowly we progressed he would always freak out when left alone for more than a few minutes. Finally one day he was so frantic that he broke a tooth trying to escape his crate - we gave up on crate training, and instead decided to bring another dog into the house to keep him company. Things were manageable for 3 years - he freaked out occasionally (especially during storms), but for the most part could be trusted at home. That is until recently when my girlfriend and I broke up. She kept the other dog, so it's just me and Whiskey again.

 

It's been hell. No matter how much desensitization training, how many treats or puzzles I leave him with, how tired I get him at the dog park, nothing works for more than a few days. Every positive association I try to make with me leaving (stuffed kong, getting fed, cheese, puzzle toys, etc) eventually just becomes another trigger to him that I'm about to leave. He's slowly chewing his way through my front door, and destroying all of my cabinets.

  

I live in a small apartment, work full days and I can't afford a second dog or daily daycare. I'm starting to think that rehoming may be my only option. It breaks my heart because I've had him for so long and he has such a wonderful personality, but I live in constant fear of what I'm going to come home to every day. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice. "	dogs

1331	[Help] Dog barks constantly at dog park	"My wife and I adopted [a chihuahua/terrier mix](https://i.imgur.com/JhxBGWt.jpg) from a shelter about a month ago.  We feel like we lucked out, because he's the gentlest, most loving dog, completely housebroken and never barks at all - except when we're at the dog park. We live in Manhattan, so it's really his only opportunity for socialization and running around, and he LOVES it - when he knows we're going there he gets super excited and basically pulls us the whole way there.
 

Once at the dog park, he finds the biggest dogs there and barks at them constantly. Not in an aggressive way - he's clearly having fun and never snaps or bites or makes physical contact. He's only 9 lbs, so they don't see him as a threat at all and generally just ignore him. My understanding is that he barks at them to try to get them to run so he can run after them, which he does. When they're not running, though, he'll just stand there and bark, and usually he's the only dog there barking. If we take him to the side partitioned off for small dogs, he'll ignore the small dogs there entirely (even if they're running around) and will stand at the fence barking at the big dogs.
 
The problem is that I feel like he's annoying the other dogs and their owners, who are usually just chilling at the park. We don't stay long - maybe 15 minutes a day - and he would get really sad if we stopped taking him there, but I don't know how to train him to not bark there, since he only does it when he's running around loose. How do you train a dog to not do something if he only does it in one particular situation? He picks up tricks quickly if we reward him with treats, but using treats there would be problematic, since it's a dog park with a lot of other dogs around. We try to tell him to stop barking, but it's not a lesson that's sticking.
 
Or is it okay and we should just let him bark when he's there?

1337	[Discussion] How did you introduce your new dog to a resident cat?	"After a long process, I have finally rescued a dog! Sophie is a \~1 year old, 35 lb. black lab mix who has previously lived in a foster home with dogs of all ages, cats, and kids. She loved playing with all of the animals and people and often took a submissive role in play. She will soon be introduced to my resident cat, a 3 year old cat that I rescued as a kitten. She isn't timid and has experience with dogs before both inside my home and while she visited my mom's home. She did well with my Mother's older dog that ignored her existence (she tried to play with him but he didn't care). My mom's younger dog, a Boston Terrier, wasn't a fan of her. He was terrified of her when he saw her as a puppy and as a result of his crying, she hissed. They've spent several days together and his fear never subsided but the worst reaction she ever gave him was a hiss. When both of these dogs visited my home while my cat was there, she spent most her time watching them from her perched window bed.

There are some adjustments I'm already prepared for. My cat already has some elevated surfaces that are already hers (heated window cat bed and a cat tower) and I will also be hanging some floating shelves for her. I'll also start transitioning her feeding to an elevated surface. Additionally, I'm going to make sure I carve out specific time during the day where I give her solo attention and play. 

I want to hear some stories about how introducing a new dog to a cat went for you. What techniques did you use and how did that go for each pet? Were there any difficulties you encountered? How long did it take you to get your pets comfortable with each other, if at all? Any advice or anecdotes would be great.

1338	[Help] Dog sometimes doesn’t eat for entire days despite being offered food twice daily.	"My four year old cavalier/bichon mix has always been a picky eater. She’s never been excited about food, even as a puppy, and I was able to free feed her and never worry about her becoming overweight. She has never liked canned food or bone broth, water, goats milk, etc. added to her food. In the last six months she has gone off kibble entirely. I have had luck getting her to eat freeze dried raw (without rehydrating and making sure she’s drinking enough water) but she still will go a day or two without eating. I’m lucky if she eats one full bowl of food in a day. 

I adopted a puppy several weeks ago and he’s a vacuum when it comes to food. I have since started to feed the two dogs breakfast and dinner - no more free feeding for the older dog. They both get rehydrated raw food with some raw coated kibble sprinkled in because they seem to enjoy the crunch. Still, my four year old dog will turn her nose up at breakfast and dinner one day, breakfast the next day, then grudgingly eat her dinner. Or she’ll skip her meals for two days straight and cave at breakfast on the third day. 

The vet doesn’t see anything wrong with her that would keep her from wanting to eat, other than being picky, and she doesn’t get very many treats or chews during the day. She rarely gets people food like cooked chicken or cheese. 

My question is, is this normal? She’s at a good weight and aside from some unrelated joint issues is healthy. Do some dogs just prefer to go several days without eating? Is there something else I can do? I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve tried so many different kibbles/canned foods/raw foods/additives over the course of her life that I’m just giving her the food, taking it away after ten minutes, and then trying again at the next mealtime. Is this the appropriate response? "	dogs
1339	[HELP] Crate trainers, where did your dog sleep the first night?	"I ask because I feel all the crate training advice I've read is very conflicting.

On the one hand, everyone says to never force your dog inside the crate, make it a positive experience, build them up to like it with treats, etc.

But then I also hear that you need to be very consistent and have them sleep in it every night.

Well, we adopted my new rescue at 1PM on Saturday and obviously there was not enough time before bedtime to get him loving his crate, especially because he isn't very food motivated yet (because, again, he's new and scared). He never wanted to step inside his crate from the moment he saw it. I was able to get him to put both front paws inside to get a treat, but only a few times, and that was it.

So that night, we had to just lift him into his crate. He whined and dug at it, but eventually settled down to sleep okay.

Did some more crate training on Sunday. No progress. Still front paws, nothing more.

But last night was bad. He took forever to settle down (went to bed at 11PM). Around 2AM he started whining and digging again on and off until finally at 4AM he was practically going berseck. My husband and I got up and turned on the lights and he stopped to watch us. My husband took him out to pee (he barely peed) and then we tried to put him back in his crate but he was freaking out, biting it, etc. I got him distracted enough to stop so I could let him out (didn't want to reward him for the behavior) and then we ended up never putting him and our other dog (crate trained) back to bed because it just felt useless at that point. My husband stayed up with them in our living room and ended up sleeping on the couch with them loose in there.

So... where do we go from here? I don't feel safe letting him sleep outside his crate. I think he will chew stuff and we don't even know if he's fully potty trained (no accidents yet, but it's only been a couple days). He is actually getting less food-motivated by the day and is eating less than his first day here :( He seems completely adjusted and happy besides the crate and eating (no panting/anxiety behaviors, happily plays with toys, relaxed on walks, etc.)

...but I'm afraid of traumatizing him if we keep stuffing him in his crate all night, every night.

So which do we prioritize: consistency, or making his crate a happy place?

Edit: I should also add that he only plays alone, not with us (and I can't seem to engage him), and he's only played with our other dog two times so far. He also isn't energetic on walks at all. And it feels much too early to take him to the dog park. So if your response is going to be to ""wear him out"" before bedtime... I'm not sure how we could do that. Suggestions appreciated."	dogs

My kids go from trying to keep the food from him to freely giving it because feeding the dog is a ""fun"" game for them. 

My wife told me last night that she thinks we should just put him in the crate whenever eating, and while I think that could work (he is crate trained) I don't think it should be necessary. He is part of the family and can learn to just lay down and wait till the humans are done eating.

Hopefully someone here has some good advice for or insight into how they've dealt with a similar situation.

1343	[HELP] Puppy suddenly terrified of kennel!	"We have a 6 month old Blue Heeler mix puppy, Luna. We've had her since she was about 2 months and she's been crated ever since. We started her off by crating her over night and while my husband and I were at work. She's learned to either hold it or wake us up at night when she needs to potty so she no longer sleeps in her crate (she and Ted - almost 2 year old Blackmouth Cur - sleep in their own beds next to our bed). We still crate her while we're out of the house and we have NEVER used her crate as a punishment. She would willingly go in her kennel whenever you asked, especially when it was feeding time. She gets fed in the kennel (with door left open) so when she would see one of us grab her bowl she'd run into the kennel and wait for food. Recently though, she avoids the kennel like the plague. She'll be extremely stubborn and run away when you ask her to go in the kennel, she'd rather not eat than go in the kennel - when she's really hungry though, she'll tiptoe to the kennel, grab a bite from her bowl and run off with her mouth full and chew somewhere else. When we manage to pick her up and put her in the kennel, she doesn't cry or yelp. She walks to her bed and sits quietly. I can't think of anything we may have done to yield a negative reaction like this but perhaps there is something I'm not seeing. What is her deal? Has anyone else had this sort of experience? Thanks in advance!

1344	[Help] Am I a terrible person for relinquishing my dog?	"I adopted a whippet/boxer/pittie mix 2 years ago from animal control. I was looking for a sweet dog that I could bring around my niece and nephews to make them more comfortable around dogs and for a companion for the dog I had at the time, who has since passed away. Animal control told me she was very sweet, but would need a lot of help with potty training because she had been physically abused, starved, and kept mainly in a crate for her whole life. When I met her, she came right up to me and put her head on my knee and just stared up at me; I had no reason to believe she was anything but sweet. I took her home with me and it all began. She had a lot of issues, but her separation anxiety and stranger aggression were out of control, so I quickly got a trainer involved. She has come a LONG way in these 2 years, but she is still such a stressor on my and my SO's lives.  My SO puts up with her for me, but I know he would be so much happier without her. When I think of giving her up, I get a sense of relief in my stomach, but I can't bring myself to physically do it.

This background is relevant to my current situation - We are going out of town next week and had everything lined up to board her. I brought her to meet the caretakers and she did fantastic with everything and I was confident she would be fine there while we were gone. However, I had all her info faxed over and they told me they needed a fecal within the last 6 months, so I had one done. And of course, she comes back with whipworm. The treatment is 2 weeks and we leave in 1... Now the boarding place won't take her. I don't even know what to do at this point. No one will board her until she's free of the whipworm. I have no friends or family that I could possibly burden with asking to watch her. It is too expensive for me to have a stay-in dog walker and I feel she would go absolutely insane being let out only 3-4 times a day for an hour. My gut is kind of taking this as a hint as maybe it's time to give her up. Am I a terrible person? I think of what a relief it would be to be free of the stress of this dog. I absolutely love her, but she is more than I ever bargained for and I feel the shelter absolutely lied to me to get me to take her. I tried last year to get a non-kill shelter to take her, but no one would. I've had her posted online for adoption for almost a year, but no bites. No one will take a dog with any behavioral issues, and now I only have a week to find a different solution. I'm feeling like my only option is to relinquish her back to animal control where I got her from. Am I a terrible person for doing so?

Thanks for reading and letting me vent."	dogs
1345	[Discussion] Dog park double standards?	"We have a 5 month old puppy, he's very intelligent, extraordinarily friendly and loves to play with other dogs.

Sadly, we live in a city and his only real exposure to other dogs usually comes from walking (which doesn't give the capacity for socialization) and the dog park. 

99% of the time we're at the dog park we have a great time. He loves retrievers and golden doodles and owners alike. Is learning to calm down on command, switch roles in play, be submissive etc. His recall is even getting better. I'm always very active, standing 3 feet away at all times and interrupting play constantly to regain my dog's attention and get a command out before playing again.

He's currently around 30-35lbs; our major issue at the moment is a particular couple that has taken issue with our pup.

They have a small breed dog (I'd say ~10lbs). It pulls and yanks around on the lead and has no discernible recall (but that doesn't matter, because it's only 10lbs, right?).

The real issue we have is that their dog is obsessed with our puppy. The moment he gets in the park he runs towards our pup and tries to get him to chase/play.

Initially, because of the size difference, I used to hold on and restrain our dog. The other smaller dog would jump all over our pup. The owner didn't seem to get the message, even when I'd push their dog away gently. This would go on for 10-15 mins at a time.

On maybe the 4th or 5th occasion that this occurred I let our pup have more freedom, having seen that he's getting much better at figuring out when a dog is smaller. Predictably when this dog started jumping on our pup he joined in the play fighting.

The small breed dog immediately became submissive and before anything could really happen yelped, when our puppy got to him.

Naturally I picked up our puppy, pulled him away and made him sit. The owners of the small dog made a big fuss about their dog, checking it's legs before storming out and standing at a distance pointing and shaking their heads at our pup.

I'm somewhat at a loss as to what to do, as it seems to sour the experience now.

It seems woefully unfair on my dog, who really wants to play and have a good time with dogs of a similar size and aptitude has to sit there and take a beating from a dog who's owners on one hand think it's OK for their dog to harass our puppy unrestrained but totally unacceptable for our dog to attempt to respond in kind.

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of behavior before? What approach did you take? 

Edit:

We always go to the large breed dog park, which is attached to the small breed park.

Even when there are lots of other dogs around and our pup is distracted by more appropriate dogs, this small dog will follow him around attempting to join in.

1349	[Breeds] What breed would fit my family the best	"Hello

We are considering getting a dog, but we never owned pets before, so we are not sure what would work for us the best.

First of all it would have to be alone at home from 8am to 4pm, 4 days a week, so I guess we need a breed thats fine being alone .  Our family consists of two adults and two kids, 9 and 13.  

We also don't want an inside dog.  Now let me elaborate. We would have a room for it inside, in the basement.  The basement is fully finished/furnished and airconditioned.  Its room would be by the walkout basement door that lead into huge fenced backyard.  So we were thinking of installing doggy doors on these doors so it can go out whenever it wants and come inside when it wants.

It would have to be a medium or preferably a large dog.  We are not really looking for a guard dog, but its a bonus.  

Any suggestions or insights are welcome, especially in regards to training and feeding. Do we get a trained dog or a puppy to train it ourselves(no experience).  We would probably get it next summer when we r home every day so that we can better assimilate it to our family. 

Thanks"	dogs
1350	[Help] Do dogs really love going to daycare?	"Hi,

So after a lot of research we definitely found a daycare that checked all the boxes and held in high standing in our area. We recently have introduced our 9 mo pup to it over the past few weeks, giving her full days (7:30-6 pm) two to three times a week.

Whenever we go to drop her off, she starts doing her excited whine as we pull in, and we literally have to pull her back to stop her from pulling and wagging her tail to go in. She always looks super excited. But then when we pick her up, she's understandably exhausted but also kind of seems to have that ""I hate you"" vibe and isn't really affectionate as much almost as if she's upset we kept her in that long.

I mean, we've checked into the Webcam and she's always up and playing and never rests, and it's hard to imagine that being too comfortable for dogs to be constantly up and about for that long.

Only asking because we are away this weekend (Wed-Sunday) and we're thinking about boarding her at this daycare. We've never boarded her and so we're extremely nervous on if she'll be okay for four nights and days.

Anyone have any advice to share about daycare/boarding with your pups to help calm our nerves?"	dogs

1354	[HELP] Puppy's UTI Won't Go Away	"This is a long one, I seriously appreciate you reading if you have experience with dogs and UTIs!

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, I noticed my 5 1/2 month old french bulldog puppy started leaving wet spots - on the couch after she was lying down and on her dog bed. She always sits at the door when she has to pee and hadn't had any accidents inside for a few weeks, so I took her to the vet.  


The vet found small amounts of blood and puss in her urine as well as crystals and streptococcus bacteria - she was diagnosed with cystitis, prescribed Clavamox (amoxicillin) twice a day for 10 days, and switched over from Acana Puppy Food to Royal Canin Urinary SO to decrease the risk of further infections. She also has a little bit of a hood over her vulva, so the vet gave me antibacterial soap and instructed me to clean her lady bits once a day for the first week, and then once a week after that.  


After 2 days, she stopped wetting her bed/couch. But then at 5 days after starting the Clavamox, the infection seemed to come back worse than before - she was leaving lots of wet spots on my patio and didn't want to come inside - she wouldn't pee on the grass, but it was clear that she had to.  


Took her back to the vet - they x-rayed her bladder - no bladder stones. Did a urinalysis and the vet was worried about the urine specific gravity, so I took him the first morning pee sample the next day and he said it was fine/her kidneys were functioning fine. The vet prescribed Simplicef instead this time - 100 mg once a day for 14 days. She's now been on Simplicef for 8 days, and I've seen no sign of improvement. It seems like in the morning she's pretty good, only dripping a little bit (only when she sits or lays down) - at around 2 pm - 4 pm, she has bigger accidents, usually sitting on the patio outside - it seems like she knows she has to pee, but she won't, but she doesn't want to make a mess in the house. She's such a good pup and I'm so sad for her and also unbelievably stressed as this is my first time owning a dog on my own (had 2 dogs growing up).  


I started trying cranberry pills with her yesterday, but tonight I sprinkled half a pill over her dinner and then she threw it up 30 minutes later. I'm not going to give her anything else tonight, but I'm kind of at a loss here. I'm going to take the vet another urine sample tomorrow.

1355	[HELP] Could this be ear mites?	"My dog is a \~5 year old dachshund chihuahua mix. About a year ago he started having very itchy ears. At the time he was on dry kibble (Taste of the Wild) so we monitored him for awhile. Then we switched him to a meat, bone, veggie, etc. homemade diet to eliminate grains and possible allergens from his diet. His ears did not get better. We tried applying vitamin E to his ears - that did not help.

​

We're probably just going to take him to the vet soon, but does this look like ear mites? Are we missing something more obvious that could be going on that we could try before taking him?  


Edited to add: It is only in one ear - the left one. It seemed to clear up for about a month and his ear looked really good until today when I noticed him scratching a lot again.

My wife and I are leaving in Vancouver, Canada. Due to our home country's situation we're having issues bringing her dog, Fiona, here. She's a Poodle Miniture, 37cm long and 52cm Tall. She has breathing problem so cargo shipment is very risky for her.

​

We are really desperate and I'm looking to you reddit for help. I know there are wonderful people with wonderful ideas that can make my wife's life so much happier.

​

In order for her to leave the country she will need to be in Cargo to either Panama city or Miami. Those ""short"" flights can be risky but Fiona can manage it with good care the issue comes that she will need to board at least 2 more plains on her way here and those are not short at all. So we are really worried and we couldn't live with it if something were to happen to her.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for help but we have asked everywhere and now I feel like reddit is our only hope for options.

1357	[Help] Why is my dog humping the air?	"I have a 4yr old shih tzu who, recently, has started doing what I can only describe as air humping. It comes out of the blue, like he's just got an itch that he needs to scratch. His bum doesn't touch the floor when he does it so it doesn't look like he's actually scratching anything, and the whole motion only lasts 5 seconds or so.

I don't think it's a mating hump, I'm worried he might have worms or some other pain or trouble around his hips/bum area that's making him itch. As soon as he does it I let him out but he doesn't need to go to the toilet.

Any ideas what could be causing this behaviour?"	dogs
1358	[Breeds] help pick a breed	"1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Grew up my entire life with dogs. Grew up taking care of a husky, golden retriever, black lab, and poodle. Had all 4 at our house growing up at one point, but 2 have passed on.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/[http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

Personally I preffer a breeder over a shelter dog, unless a shelter dog has a breed im interested in.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

A dog the will be my companion that I can take places I go in public and do the things I want to do, such as hiking and so on. Prefer them not to be hyper 24/7, but energy when playing is a given. I want a laid back companion that can be with me and explore.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

Newfoundlands, Leonbergers, German Shepherds, Sarplaninac's, anatolian shepherd, asain shepherd, other big dog breeds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

I would teach my dog all the basic commands.

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

The first 4 months I could devote hours as I have a light semester for college and dont go out much right now.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

I can give my dog daily exercise, such as hikes, walks, jogs, runs, and parks

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I can do daily grooming, grew up with hairy dogs so its normal.

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

I like big dogs, basically German Shepherd Size or bigger. But I am not looking for a super lazy dog that doesnt want to do anything.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Not a huge fan of shedding, but can deal with it. Limited barking is preferred, and a little slobber is fine, but if it just pours slobber out of its mouth 24/7 im not interested.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

My dogs when at the house im at will have an electric fence and never leashed on the property, but I may live in a apartment for a semester this year, so it should be able to adapt to that life style if needed.

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Either or. I love big cuddly dogs, but if there is a breed that likes some independence that would work best for me I am not against it.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

I want a dog to be my companion in life, and if it looks to please that is fine.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

I would like a dog not to be aggressive unless someone is being aggressive towards me or the property.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Super hyper active is a no go for me. I want my dog to be able to be nice and relaxed with me and in public, but if its play time then by all means be hyper and have fun.

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

4 hours would probably be the longest average, but should be able to be alone for 8

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

none

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

no

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

no, but if I have a kid when im older maybe if it is still alive in its older years

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

currently no restrictions

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

none

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

summers: hottest it will be is 85, but average is in the 70's

Winter: it can hit -30 to -55 with wind chill, so the dog needs to handle adverse temperatures

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

The only thing I dont really want in my dog is excessive slobber. Everything else isnt that big of an issue if the breed best fits me. It needs to be able to be out in public and be friendly.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

1359	[Help] 16 month old dog - missing teeth and a neuter question!	"My dog will be 16 months in September and he’s a 65 pound mixed breed from a rescue. The general opinion is that he looks vaguely like a pointer mixed with a Great Dane, with maybe a little boxer in the mix? Aside from some random guesses, we have no idea of his breed. 

We noticed that he was missing a couple of adult teeth, but at his last checkup, it was discovered that he is missing 4 teeth total. 2 bottom jaw teeth (one on each side) that appear to be premolars, 1 upper jaw tooth, and a tooth beside his canine are all missing. The skin is smooth where the teeth should be and our vet isn’t sure if they’re hiding beneath the gum line or simply don’t exist. She has recommended putting him under for dental X-rays and is also recommending that we go ahead with his neuter at the same time. The appointment is scheduled for later this week. 

Now, for the problem... I don’t know that I want to get him neutered at this point. We have NO interest in breeding him and he is always on a leash when outside - never unattended. So far, he hasn’t displayed any negative behaviors typically associated with being intact. He marks quite often on walks, but never indoors (even when we stay in hotels!) and he’s very sweet and generally submissive with other dogs. The only concern is that he has been getting some strange reactions from dogs on walks lately. For example, he met a couple of dogs on a walk this weekend that were initially fine with him, but after the hello sniff was finished and we started to walk away, they became aggressive and tried to snap at him. Both times he jumped out of snapping range and didn’t return any aggression. 

I’ve read some studies that seem to link neutering to an increase risk of certain cancers, cruciate ligament tears, etc. so I don’t know that the benefit is worth the risk of a neuter, but if he’s going to be put under anyway... should we just go ahead with it to head off any future issues?

1364	[Help] Housebroken dog suddenly not.	"My dog is about 2. I adopted him one year and one month ago and he has been perfectly housebroken the whole time. There have been no changes in schedules, but he's suddenly no longer potty trained.  


He poo'd on the floor on Friday and I figured it was because I'd given him some of my dinner and maybe it had bothered his stomach. This happened overnight, while I was sleeping, and he'd had his usual bathroom break. Then he did it again on Sunday, when I was gone for maybe an hour. Today I got home for work and he'd gone again in the same place, but this time he'd peed too. He actually had a longer-than-normal walk before I left this morning, and I was only gone as long as I usually am.  


All of the stool was soft but not liquid, except one portion of today's was solid (it looked like he went twice).  


What the heck?! I have no idea what caused this. The only recent change is a few weeks ago I started letting him into the bedroom with me at night, but why would that make him act -worse-??? When I first got him I kept him in the bathroom at night, but I've always let him loose in the house during the day because all the usual crate training tricks wouldn't work (I figure due to a trauma in his past life).

But it got me wondering, am I being a jerk? Is is poor manners to allow her to relieve herself wherever and whenever the need arises? I've yelled at people for leaving their mess in my yard, but if it gets cleaned up immediately... it's never even crossed my mind to get upset about that."	dogs

Between my injury and her infection I've spent lots on people and dog Dr.'s in the past few weeks and I'm hoping to avoid it again if I can. Obviously I'll take her back if I have to but was hopeful someone here had some tips. Thanks in advance 	dogs

1368	[Help] Should our dog be able to hold it through the night by now?	"Our rescue is almost 6 months old, and he’s pretty much all potty trained unless we’re super dumb and don’t notice his signs. But he rarely can hold it all night. We typically go to bed during the week around 10, and his water is cut off around 8-8:30. Even if he goes right before bed, he’s whining between 2-3am to go. Then he’s good and goes back to sleep. 

Is there anything we should be doing to curb this or is he still too little to hold it that long?"	dogs
1369	[Fluff] I just love my pup so much!	"Shes a &lt;5 month old border collie. I was told that she'd be crazy off the charts hyper, which isn't an outright lie, but she's a LOT more manageable than I thought.

I've had her since she was seven weeks old and she's slept in my bed since day one (thank you walmart, for having plastic sheets!) She watches over my rats, and I feel totally safe with having them in the same room unsupervised.

She's sooo empathetic and I love it. If I pretend to cry she's immediately in my face licking me and trying to cheer me up. Just now, there was a shopping cart squeaking on tv that sounded like a dog whining, and she immediately dropped her chew toy and went to find who was crying.

She's always respected that cats don't usually want to interact right away, and will leave them alone if they seem unsure. She's awesome on walks and has amazing recall already. There is a secluded trail near my house that is apparently easy to miss. I usually walk her when it's getting dark so usually theres no one there. I leave the leash on but she's free to walk as she likes. She always stays within 30 feet of me. If I feel like she's not watching me enough, I hide behind a tree and wait for her to find me, after that she stays a lot more conscious about where I am.

She still has some issues we need to work out, but she's been a very good dog so far and I just love her so much."	dogs

1372	[Help] Incident with other dog walker	"I have a two year old labrador who is super friendly with humans and other dogs. He is often walked off lead at a park/country lane near our home and his recall is excellent. I walk him alone, generally off lead, unless we see a dog who is on lead, or a cyclist/young child.  I'm a 23 year old woman, this is relevant later. We have never had a negative incident - he is friendly with everyone that we meet - dog or human. 

Until... a few months ago, we were approached by a couple with three dogs. All three dogs were off lead, so I left my dog off his lead too. The dogs left their owners and ran over to us. The male owner tried to shout them back, but they ignored him. This was fine, until the dogs started displaying aggressive body language - they stood in front of him, very alert/tense, with their tails raised and they were growling. My dog was unhappy with this, and growled back - he was trying to keep his distance, but all three dogs were very large and their owners were quite far away. We quickly walked on in an attempt to get away from the situationt and prevent it escalating - he immediately followed me and the dogs (thankfully) did not. When the owners eventually passed us, they were very unpleasant to me, stating that my dog was aggressive and shouldn't be off his lead/around other dogs, etc. Despite them being far in the distance when the incident happened!

This morning, we encountered the dogs again. They all charged at my dog, who once again let out a warning growl. He was still off his lead, as I did not even see the dogs coming until it was too late. He didn't expose his teeth or move towards them.  When the owners eventually caught up to their dogs, the male owner verbally abused me, he was swearing and hurling insults at both me and my dog. He cited the previous incident as an example of my dog's 'aggression'. This culminated in him threatening to kill my dog, and I was feeling very intimidated, so I just walked on. I spoke to my dog walker about this situation and she said that the man has quite the reputation in the area for being obnoxious and never keeping his dogs on lead.

I'm suppose I'm looking for some advice on the situation. Was I or my dog out of line? Is there anything I can do other than keeping  him on lead at all times, just in case? 

**TLDR**: Incident with an abusive dog walker and his three off-lead dogs. Is my dog aggressive for letting out  a warning growl?"	dogs
1373	Dog are human poop in the park [help]	"So today the dog got into human poop in the park. I pulled him away almost immediately but he still had a go at it. We are working on leave it but it’s an uphill battle as he is an ex street dog rescue so scavenging to eat is a big thing for him. 

We live in the big city and the only people pooping in the city park and leaving it out in the open are most like intravenous drug users who hang around there after dark. 

Apart from being completely disgusting I am worried about what he could catch from the poop or if it has traces of drugs still in it. Anyone know if this is possible? 

He has a vets appointment tomorrow on an unrelated matter so we will ask them but if anyone has dealt with a similar issue and has spoken to a vet about it please share!

Thanks an apologies for the disgusting nature of this post.

He came home with me Sunday morning and hasn’t eaten anything since then. He doesn’t even respond to treats. I know that I’m supposed to stick to a routine and trust that he’ll come around (everything is new after all - including me), but it breaks my heart to hear his little belly rumble because he hasn’t eaten anything but some grass (and thrown it up again) in the last 35h. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation? I have a vet appointment in the morning, but am mostly looking to ease my mind here.

1379	[Help] six year old dog may be aggressive towards small dogs	"Hi

My dog Hercules is a 6 year old, 58 pound rhodesian ridgeback mix.[Hercules ](https://i.imgur.com/AujkiUw.jpg) I got him from the humane society when he was a little over 1. He had signs of trauma but we have worked through that an now he trusts us completely. He doesn't ever bite, hurt, or even bark at us unless he is playing. He also hasn't destroyed anything in our home but his toys. 


My little rat terrier passed away about 3 years ago and ever since then he hasn't been the same. I took him to see my cousins dog a few months back and he loved it, her dog is a similar breed - that was in an enclosed space though. He isn't social anymore and I'm afraid to take him to the dog park because of his reactions towards dogs and now I don't know what to do. 


Right now i live in a senior community so there's a bunch of little dogs who aren't trained at all. Many of them are off leash and just this morning he saw a little pomeranian and started barking and growling. The owner of course got worried, but hello please keep your dog on a leash! He didn't used to be like this before my other dog passed and he will whine non stop when the other dog leaves. 


How can I reintroduce him to other dogs? He is so lonely, and the old folks home has nothing but small dogs and nervous neighbors."	dogs
1380	[Help] Potty training 3 year old dog	"My dog's training has been pretty neglected over the time that we've had him. I've had school, which prevents me from taking care of him until i'm home. My parents don't really bother to take care of the dog much more than letting him out once. I've finally come to realize that I need to start doing more, but with the bad habits that he has now I don't know where to begin.

I usually walk him two or three times a day, to allow him to poop (as he only poops when on walks). Because of that, he doesn't poop inside unless he hasn't gone outside. The main issue here is peeing in the house. Even with 2-3 walks where he is constantly marking everything outside, he still will pee in the house if not watched. I try to either keep him in his pen or bring his blanket in to the room with me so i can watch him in between walks/being let into the yard. This usually works.  However, I don't know how to start easing him into roaming free around the house without marking. 

Finally, the only times that I am home are in the morning and in the afternoon after coming back from school. Is it possible for me alone to potty train my dog, or will I have to convince my parents to become more involved?"	dogs

1382	[HELP] thinking about getting a dog - which breed	"My Boyfriend and I are thinking about getting a dog but we are a little but uncertain about which breed. We both work full time but can work from home. The dog will be alone for 3 workdays a week. We thought it would be a good idea to leave him/her in the garden during that period with a doghouse and other shelter and some toys. It is not a big garden and doesn't have any grass. It would preferably also be a dog who doesn't bark when left alone.

When we are at home and during the night, the dog will be inside.

1383	[Help] 3 Dogs	"So to start things I'll give a description of my Dogs and their names.

Candy : 9 yrs old : Jack Russel Mix : Playful &amp; Curious

Deogee  : 3 yrs old : Yorkie Mix : Hyper &amp; Playful

Bucky : 14 Weeks : Pit/Boxer Mix : Loving &amp; Playful

Pet Descriptions: 

I have had Candy since I was a kid and she's always been my bestfriend and there for me at all times. I've always been very protective of her and careful with what she gets into. She's always been good with other dogs including other breeds like Chihuahua, German Shepard, Red Tick Coon Hound, Australian Shepard, and a Yellow Lab. Until she gets used to them she'll make sure they know her proximity and she will usually stay away from the dog for awhile so she can have time alone.

My fiance moved into my house about 2 weeks after I moved in and she brought along her dog Deogee. Deogee has been good she's pretty playful but used to wrestle with my fiance's parents dogs which were a female boxer and a Male poodle. My fiance said she's never really got too rough with those dogs, like biting or hurting the other dogs. She's a good dog but will run to you if you say anything at all in her direction and jump all over you.

My fiance and I got Bucky roughly 2 weeks ago and he's a really good puppy. He's very playful with both Candy and Deogee and he likes to relax with Candy. Like any other puppy he's curious and is learning where he can be around the other dogs.

Problem:

Candy and Deogee get into it almost everyday and fight for a good 15 seconds. Candy for the first few fights never bit or scratched but tried Intimidating deogee with barking and pushing. Deogee however started the first bug fight with biting and scratching and scratched Candy's brow and making it swell as well as drawing blood on her nose. Since that fight candy has been more aggressive in the fights and with bite and scratch. This morning candy actually bit and scratched deogee and ultimately man handled her and gave her 2 small cuts. 

Deogee has snapped at Bucky and have bit him on his face drawing blood and will get rough with him too. But with him he usually will back out of the fight and she will walk away.

Candy will constantly follow deogee with her ears perked up and making sure that Deogee is behind her and essentially following her. Seems like candy tries to corral her and be the top dog which she rightfully is. This causes many of the fights as well as when either are trying to jump on the furniture while the other is in it.

These don't always happen but they all do coexist from time to time and will lay with one another and be civil. But my fiance and I are concerned for our dogs and neither of us want to get rid of any of the dogs nor put any down.

If anyone can give me advice I appreciate it and I'm sorry for the novel I wrote.

1384	[Help] I am looking for toys to buy for my dog	"Hello

&amp;#x200B;

For quite some time now I have been looking for a toy to get for my dog but everything I buy seems pointless because he is not interested after a while. I want to find something that will keep him busy for a longer period of time. Can you recommend me the toys that your dog plays with? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I tried searching online but I am always sceptical when it comes to buying things for my dog online. I stumbled on a pretty interesting website few days ago and It caught my eye because they deliver every month a surprise box for your dog. But still I have never used their service and it would be great if someone could give me an insight in what do they actually send me.

1385	[Help] Is it better to send a dog to daycare or hire a dog walker to walk her every weekday?	"My wife and I both work full time during the day and up until recently we would come home over lunch for about half an hour to let our 1 year old Samoyed out of her crate to do her business and play. However there are some life changes coming soon which means that we will not be able to come home for lunch anymore. While our dog could probably hold her bladder for the full 8 hours, we cannot yet trust her to be unsupervised in the house (or even just the kitchen!) and therefore would need to be crated the entire 8 hours. Like most people, we don't really want to do this as it seems cruel and harsh, not to mention she has a ton of pent-up energy when we come home from work. 

We are trying to evaluate our options, and so far we have two: take our dog to daycare every day for about 8 hours (Monday to Friday) or hire a dog walker to come at lunch time for a half hour walk. We're not sure what the best option is so I'm hoping for your insight and advice! Here is a pro/con list (at least what I can think of) for the two options:

**Doggie Daycare**

Pros:

* Dog gets socialization with many dogs she already knows. She has been to the daycare many times before and is well known by staff.
* Won't be crated all day during the weekdays
* She has someone watching her all day
* She will be well exercised and tired when we pick her up after work allowing us to do more in the evenings; won't feel guilty if we crate her in the evenings to go run errands

Cons:

* She will get used to playing 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with other dogs. This is my biggest concern. I'm afraid she might not be able to calm down on days when she can't go to daycare for whatever reason.
* Given her breed, she will get quite dirty every day and will require combing daily in the evenings
* Slightly more expensive ($350 per month - $17.50 per visit)
* Slightly more inconvenient (have to go 5 minutes out of the way on daily commute to drop her off and pick her up)
* Increased risk of injury: our dog plays hard and gets sore paws!
* Will probably feel guilty if we have to bring her to daycare on the weekend for whatever reason since she was there all week

**Professional Dog Walker**

Pros:

* No worries about ""building a beast"" dog that will be used to playing 8 hours per day with other dogs
* No worries about her getting dirty by playing with other dogs
* Slightly more convenient as the dog walker comes to our house in the middle of the day to walk dog

Cons:

* Only a half hour outside of crate during the day. Will still be in crate alone at home for other 7.5 hours.
* No socialization with other dogs
* Marginally cheaper than dog daycare ($340 per month - $17 per walk) but still an expensive service for only a half hour walk
* Won't do much to reduce dog's energy in the evenings after work

Even after writing the pro/con lists, I'm not sure what option is the best. For daycare, the biggest benefit is our dog will be tired and socialized every day giving us more time for other things, but I'm afraid she will become overly hyper and uncontrollable on days where she can't go to daycare and will play too hard, injuring herself (she often tries to lick her paws after spending more than 1 day at daycare). For dog walking, those risks aren't there, but it doesn't alleviate the massive amounts of energy our dog has in the evenings which is difficult to handle at times. Plus the dog walking is hardly cheaper compared to daycare - it's only $10 less per month, and it's a half hour service compared to 8 hours of service at daycare.

What would you do? Does anyone here send their dog to daycare every day during the work week? Did it help your dog or make things worse? Is a dog walker better? Is there another option I'm missing? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!"	dogs

1387	[Help] Redirected Aggression?	"I have two 10 month old male (intact) rescue dogs. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/99y9uk) is an earlier thread with details of their exercise regimen and routine.

My area has an enormous number of stray dogs, and my dogs lose it when we're out on a walk. They spent 4 months at a training kennel, and are socialized with dogs, but we're had no opportunity to meet friendly dogs since they got back three months ago. Initially they mostly ignored the stray dogs, and would pull a bit. Now the sight of an aggressive stray sends them into a frenzy, and it's getting worse. It's taking longer and longer for them to calm down after being dragged away, and as they get bigger it's increasingly difficult to pull.

My understanding is that this is a case of Redirected Aggression, but I'm not sure what's the best thing to do here. Attempts to distract them with treats before they see the dogs and go bonkers is only somewhat successful. They are well exercised, and spend a significant part of the day exhausted and sleeping. My guess is that neutering will help, though I'm unsure. The initial plan was to neuter at one year, but if this behaviour continues it might be better to do it now. We'd also be mostly likely moving to another area in a few months, without strays."	dogs
1388	[Discussion] Taking dogs across borders	"Hi, 

We are going camping Thursday in Vermont (from Quebec) and this is the first time with our 2 dogs.  We went last year with the one we had and had no issues but he was only 7 months old.

Now we have 2 and they are over a year old.

As per dogs defending territory they bark when strangers come to the house, or people we know come over (they stop once they are inside - just bark when they arrive)

I am a little nervous about them reacting to the border guy coming to the window.  I am afraid (Neeva especially) will start to bark at them while they ask us the usual questions...

Opie will bark too if Neeva starts...

1389	[Help] My vet has told me to put my dog on a canned food to increase his calories. I'm lost as to what to buy.	"My other dog has been stealing my dog's food (we are working on it, but it's a challenge). My vet has suggested giving him a bit of canned food with his regular food because it's higher calorie and will likely entice him to eat his food as well. He's a very slow eater and likes to eat on his own terms. I've been putting lettuce/cheese in his bowl to get him to eat, but he needs to put some weight on so I'll add the canned food until he's gained a couple kgs.

​

I am in Canada and would like something that is good quality, but I'm also a student so definitely do need to consider cost. He currently eats Kirkland food, but where I am, Costco does not have Kirkland canned food - only Pedigree and Ceasar. While I know that would be the economical option to go with, I have my doubts about the quality of that food. If it is fine, I will buy it for him, but he is nearly 13 years old so I don't want to be giving him food that isn't good for him. As far as treats goes, he will get veggies a lot when we are cooking, one egg each week, and a Greenies dental chew every day.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a decent (at least Kirkland level quality) but somewhat affordable canned food in Canada?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I was just on dogfoodadvisor, and it looks like President's Choice has some good options, and knowing that brand, would probably be very cost friendly. Does anyone have any experience with this food?"	dogs
1390	Should my roommate rehome her dog? Or do you think we can make it work? [help]	"Despite everyone else telling her it was a bad idea, one of my roommates adopted a 2y/o female BBM about a month ago from our local humane society. 

She’s sweet and seems like a good dog, but she’s definitely got some “shelter dog issues” like leash reactivity, fear of men, and occasional accidents in the house. 
Plus, she’s got a LOT of energy which I know is usually typical of pits/pit mixes. 
Now I would consider myself to be pretty dog savvy. I’ve worked with dogs before, and had a staffy mix and an aussie growing up. 
My roommate who adopted her said she signed her up for 18 weeks of training at Petco, but she doesn’t really seem serious about it. (She never works with the dog at home, which I feel like is the most important part) 

(Btw, we’re all students- we live in an off-campus apartment with 3 other girls.(5 people total) The house is a decent size, but has no backyard. )

Lately, as the dog has gotten more comfortable around us, she’s developed some more issues. She barks and growls at guests, and her thing with men has caused a lot of friends to not want to come back to our house because they’re scared of her. 
She jumped up and bit my boyfriend the other day and he got rather upset about it. 
Two of the roommates have complained as well that they feel like they can’t be downstairs or in the house at all when she’s out. (sometimes she’s uncrated and roaming the house when my roommate’s gone for work) 

My roommate that adopted her is never home to take care of her, which is why she told me yesterday that she’s thinking about rehoming her. 
She works 2 jobs, is taking a full load of classes, and is very active in her sorority. The dog is crated 10+ hours a day, and gets one or two walks around the neighborhood as her only exercise. 
It fucking sucks because I’ve actually gotten really attached to the dog. When I’m not busy myself, I’m the one who walks her and I’ve been working with her to get her to be more calm around situations that stress her out. She follows me around the house and sleeps in my room sometimes.

Im pissed and upset about this whole situation. This is the second time this has happened with the same girl. 
She and her friend got a 4 month old puppy around this time last year and they basically dropped him on my doorstep and told me to take care of him for them, because they didn’t have enough money to pay for training he needed. (He had a lot of behavior issues as well) 
I eventually had to rehome that puppy because my house at the time was way too small, and I worked a full time job and didn’t feel like it was fair to him to keep him. 
Now I’m dealing with the same exact situation and it’s breaking my heart. 

Part of me is pissed at her and feels that she needs to go through the heartbreak of giving up her dog, so she doesn’t make this mistake again. 
But another part of me really loves the dog and wants to make it work for her. I know its definitely not an ideal situation, but I don’t think we’ll be living here longer than a year. Would it be worth it to keep trying? Or should we just rehome her?

Tl;dr: roommate made a hasty decision to adopt a dog that is now becoming too much for her to handle. She’s a bad fit for the house and we’re torn between making it work and just rehoming her. 

Edit: fixed some grammar

1391	My dog needs to be reprogrammed [Help]	"So a while ago I got a 10 week old male gsd puppy (I’ve owned him for almost a month now). So far so good except for 2 things: 1. Hygiene; 2. Baths. For his hygiene: whenever he pees or takes a dump, sometimes he lays or steps on it which results in him making the floor dirty and himself as well. When that happens, he often takes a bath every day or two (depends). For the baths: for some reason he doesn’t like water although I tried everything possible to make him love it. I make sure the water is warm, not hot or cold and i even sit with him in the bathtub to calm him down, but still no result. He keeps on crying and constantly tries to escape from the bathtub. 
Help ASAP would be much appreciated because I’m fed up with the daily baths! "	dogs
1392	[Discussion] How to Train a Dog to Walk Up Stairs? - 5 Easy Steps!	"Climbing stairs, though far from easy from a dog’s point of view, is still much simpler than going down them. Although going up relies on upper body strength, going down is more a matter of balance.

You should train him how to sit or stay first. do the same thing with the treat. show him by positioning his body how to sit. put you hand on the ground and push his body down. once he does give him a treat. for him to stay, show him the treat. then slowly walk away. say stay. if he does, give him the treat.

When you get to your house and he approaches the stairs, tell him to sit or stay. if he does, give him a treat. and then walk upstairs allowing to see another one. once he does, give him another one. Eventually, stop giving him a treat every time he sits down but instead when he goes up the stairs."	dogs

1394	[Help] We've adopted a young dog &amp; I would love some training tips!	Our guess is he's somewhere around a year &amp; a half old, there's no doubt that he's quite intelligent &amp; he does know some basic commands but his listening skills could use some work. Obviously when adopting we knew to expect this so there is no surprise but I was just wondering if anyone had some good training tips. Working on learning his name, leash training, (big time leash puller!) &amp; basic obedience to start. Thank you!	dogs
1395	[Breeds] Family dog breed suggestions	" Any thoughts on a breed for my family? See questionnaire below.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* As an adult, yes. My family had a English Setter mix when I was in middle and high school that I did a substantial amount of the care, but clearly the ultimate responsibility was not mine.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No real preference as long as we get a puppy. I have a 3 year old, and I'm afraid of getting an adult dog that might not appreciate my daughters rough play. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, extremely good with kids, energetic enough to go running and hiking with me, but pretty chill when we're around the house in the evening. No desire to have a guard dog. Dog should be at least 45 pounds, preferably larger than that. I'm not a small dog person at all.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Labs and Goldens because they are friendly. Been looking at Greater Swiss and Bernese mountain dogs as well because they seem to be friendly and not hyper-active. I'd love to have something like a border collie when I'm interacting with the dog, but I'm afraid they'd drive me nuts while I'm trying to watch TV.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I want the dog to be very responsive to commands in public, so that I can let the dog off-leash while hiking or running if I'm in a location where that is appropriate without fearing that they'll run off, or start a fight with another dog. In the house, just simple commands like sit, stay, come, etc. No desire for agility training events.

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work a full time job, and would only be able to come home during normal working hours at lunch maybe once or twice a week. My wife works part-time, and would be home 2-3 of those days, but there'd be one or two days per week where the dog is alone for 10 hours or so. (We might work around this during the first few months of being a puppy when that length of time simply won't work.) 

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Probably 2 \~ 1 mile walks daily, one or two trips weekly to a nearby dog park. Lots of fetch type activities in the yard otherwise.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* No professional help, preferably little brushing. My wife is uncomfortable with a golden for this reason.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* 45+ lbs, not afraid of 100-120 pounds.

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Excessive barking is a no. I'm fine with shedding, my wife isn't. Slobber doesn't bother me as long as it's not excessive.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very. This is one of the most important traits to me personally.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* Happy and non-threatening.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. My dog growing up was like this, so I'm capable of dealing with it, but that was one of the worst things about him. 

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Hyperactivity, aggressive to kids/guests.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* See above

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Low shedding for my wife, running/hiking companion for me, we both are protective of our little one. We have 3 kids @ 8, 5, and 3 years old. The older two would just love a dog, the little one needs a dog that's not going to growl at her when she gives it a hug around its neck.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have an outside cat.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* yes yes yes. All the time.

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Own

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Nashville. I don't think there are any bans.

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* high 80s average, peaking over 100 and humid on hot days, winters can have days where the temp doesn't climb above the low 20s.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I really enjoyed having a unique dog growing up. I'd be fine with a  lab/golden, but would prefer something less common (like a swissy). The fit with my family is more important though. This preference is minor. However, if an uncommon and a common breed are fairly equally appropriate, I'll generally lean toward the less common one.

1. Feel free to ask any questions below.

* Q on fencing: I have a one acre yard that's 100% wooded, steep, and almost 100% front-yard. I cannot provide a fenced area. Due to how my yard is set up, an invisible fence is really my only option. Whatever breed we get would need to be responsive to an invisible fence type barrier. "	dogs
1396	[Help] Crating two puppies in the same room or not?	Hello! So yesterday my girlfriend and I adopted a 3 month Shiba/Husky mix to keep our 7 month Husky company while we're at work (They will be alone about 6 hours every day), and for the time being, they both still need to be crated while alone. Husky has a bad chewing problem, which we're working on and will eventually be able to be free in the house while the new puppy is still new, and will be kept in her cage overnight, and throughout the day. At the moment we have her in the living room, and he's in our computer room, but we were wondering if it would be better to crate them in the same room? We've been working them into each other, letting them play for 30-1hr, then putting them apart to rest and recoup, before letting them enjoy each other, which seems to go well. THe husky is a bit overzealous with her, but in a bad way though, more like he's not sure of his own strength. Any thoughts are welcome with this! Also happy to hear other advice! 	dogs

1398	[Help] Russell Terrier puppy overly playful at night	"Hello everyone! I need some help with trying to control the behavior of our new puppy.

We have a Russell Terrier puppy, he is 8 weeks old and his name is Georgie! [Heres some pics!](https://imgur.com/a/TDGOqE4)

Georgie has had his first two vaccinations and from everything we can tell, is a perfectly healthy puppy. He’s doing very well with potty training; we can count the amount of accidents he’s had on one hand. We got him on Thursday.

He has done fairly well at night too. He sleeps in my parents bed (we gave in quick) and for the most part he’s slept through the night besides a few trips outside to go potty. 

The one thing, though, is that my dad gets up every morning for work very early, at 4:30. We live in a fairly small house, so anything he does is pretty audible. This excites Georgie and every night it’s basically resulted in my mom having to play with him at that ungodly hour until he calms down.

Alongside that, last night he was especially restless and kept my mom up a lot more. Lots of puppy biting and trying to play. 

My question here is, what’s the best way to calm him down at specific times when we need him to calm down, specifically that 4:30 time when my dad is getting ready? We as new puppy owners fully understand that a new puppy means a lack of sleep and some of these things we just need to deal with considering how young he is, but we also feel we’re getting him into a routine. We try to calm him down during this time but he’s simply wired.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks."	dogs
1399	[Fluff] First Title!	"Penelope got her first title in Novice Trick Dog!

We had been trying to find an available proctor for a bit when the stars aligned perfectly last week and one of the CGC evaluators listed on the AKC's site just happened to be well in our area, open, AND own dobermans. We, incidentally, had been at the same WAE this year.

I'm very proud of the work we've done in the year I've owned Penelope. Down from 117 bs to 90 lbs. Fear-reactivity down from on-sight to 6 feet. An all-around calmer and friendlier girl who is up for anything. The park was full of distractions (frisbee!) but she did her 10 tricks twice and maintained focused.

It's no CGC but it means a lot to me. Reactivity can be rough but there are plenty of options like TD, rally, parkour, nosework, weight pull, barn hut, etc etc.  Knowing that we can do even more together fills my heart.

\#||Team|Record|Comment				
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--				
1.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	13-3	|	The defending Super Bowl champions will start the season with Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles at QB.  While the preseason raised more questions than it answered, if the Eagles intend to repeat, then Foles will need to shine until Carson Wentz is cleared to take back the reins.
2.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	13-3	|	""Each year is a new year, and each year has its own challenges. Again, each year we all have to regain our — to the best we can — our ability to perform our jobs. That's what I'm trying to do. I think that's what all of the players, all of the coaches, we're all trying to do that."" - Bill Belichick.
3.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	13-3	|	Last year the Vikings had two top-ten-graded WRs, two top-ten-graded TEs, a surprisingly decent O-line that ranked 17th in pass blocking grade and 13th in run blocking grade, and the #1 defense in the NFL. They followed that up this off-season by upgrading at QB, signing a pro bowl DT (making it six total pro bowlers on the defense), and got Dalvin Cook back. Last time they looked this good (in 2010), everyone died, the team went 6-10 and our stadium collapsed. So fans are all pretty excited to find out how they're gonna lose their seventh-straight NFC Championship Game.
4.	| [](/NO) | Saints |	11-5	|	The Saints come into the 2018 season with high expectations. Answering the defensive questions alongside the explosion of one of fantasy football's favorite new weapons caused a big stir in 2017 and had them a play away from a title game. On paper the only limitation to them is a Drew Brees regression, which they appear to have built contingencies for.  They lose Mark Ingram to start the season, but have a pretty favorable schedule in those 4 weeks.
5.	| [](/LA) | Rams |	11-5	|	News of the Rams' big name signings and extensions were among the top NFL headlines this off-season, as massive improvements on both sides of the ball gives fans tremendous hope for this season. Still, an embarrassing early exit in the playoffs last year leaves them appropriately skeptical if this team can execute on their talent when needed.  While it is nice to have a *floor* of 8-8, instead of a *ceiling* of 8-8 (Fisher scars remain), the goal is to play football in February.
6.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	13-3	|	Straight to the point: Le'Veon Bell is betting on himself. He's betting that the Steelers will be lost without him. The Steelers are betting they won't be. The problem is that if the Steelers are right and James Conner is good enough to help the team win, saying ""See, we told you so"" doesn't build any good feelings with Bell and his camp. When you're starting a season, is this the kind of tension and drama you want?
7.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	10-6	|	The time for the Jaguars being the off-season darlings is over. It's time for them to put up or shut up. Duval vs. all y'all.
8.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	10-6	|	A middling Atlanta off-season included not much more than signing depth players and retaining current talent. If /u/Jaguargator9's preseason curse doesn't come to fruition, Sarkisian can prove he belongs in the NFL as a play caller, and Matt Ryan can stop throwing butt interceptions, ~~the sky~~ another disappointing loss in another Super Bowl is the limit.
9.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	7-9	|	With a significantly overhauled roster and a new defensive coordinator, it's an interesting time for the Packers. The Bears come to Lambeau with the highest paid defensive player in the league to face the highest paid offensive player. Predictions that the NFCN will be a bloodbath this year will be tested immediately.
10.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	9-7	|	The Cal State Dominguez Hills Chargers FC find themselves in a familiar place when it comes to expectations for the 2018 season. Fans can get excited about the return of future HoFer Antonio Gates, but will he and the Chargers finally put the pieces together for a playoff run?
11.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers |	11-5	|	The Panthers are one of the biggest question marks among the early season contenders. What will Norv Turner's new offense produce as Cam Newton works with DJ Moore and Torrey Smith? And how will the defense fair against the offenses of the NFC South?
12.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	10-6	|	There are a lot of question marks going into the season for the Chiefs.  How will second year starter Patrick Mahomes play?  Will the secondary be as bad as advertised?  Can they survive their early season brutal schedule?  What in the world is wrong with Eric Berry?  Hopefully after Week 1 some questions will be answered, for good or for bad.
13.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	9-7	|	The Titans made a bold move by firing their coach after winning a playoff game at the end of last year. The main question is going to be how quickly the players can mesh with the new defensive and offensive schemes. The biggest area of concern seems to be the learning curve for Marcus Mariota with Matt LaFleur's offense, which can take some time to master.
14.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	4-12	|	Texans fans finally have the chance to attend the Electric Circus this year, as it looks like Watt and Clowney may actually be uninjured and on the same field at the same time. And thankfully it seems our long-running QB drought has ended as fans (and coaches) expect that Watson will definitely *Be Someone* this season, but with only a few games under his belt since his injury, it's too early to crown him the People's Champ because, as everyone knows, it takes grinding to be a king (even for first round draft picks). Will the Texans finally sip the sweet syrup of victory, or will it be another season of double-cupping disappointment? Only time can tell.
15.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	9-7	|	The Lions caught an early wave of hype after the signing of new HC Matt Patricia in February, but most have cooled significantly on them since then. Less than outstanding preseason performances and roster moves by division rivals have certainly overshadowed Detroit. It's important to remember the Lions did aggressively address their biggest weakness this off-season, however, and if there is significant improvement in the run game, it could change everything for this team.
16.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	9-7	|	The biggest story entering the preseason was how first round rookie Lamar Jackson would do. But while he was having rookie growing pains, Joe Flacco had an excellent 16 attempts, and Robert Griffin III earned himself a roster spot as the backup. This high level of preseason play has become customary for the Ravens, with their 5-0 preseason following a couple of 4-0 ones, and increasing their preseason win streak to 13 games.
17.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	6-10	|	Its rare that a 6-10 team enters the season with such high expectations, but that is the result of the season-altering trade for Jimmy Garoppolo. From 1-10 to 5-0, 2017 was a tale of two seasons. All the questions around the Niners boil down to one basic question: Which team will show up in 2018?
18.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	9-7	|	The makeover of the Cowboys over the past two seasons has been disturbingly drastic. Now boasting the youngest roster in the NFC, casual fans will probably struggle to name more than a handful of starters from a roster full of question marks. Committed to building through the draft, this year will serve as first indicator as to whether or not this will be a repeat of the 1989 rebuild, which looks superficially similar.
19.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	5-11	|	The Bears took advantage of their financial flexibility to make a huge splash by trading for Khalil Mack and promptly making him rich. While the Bears are far from in ""win now"" mode, it's clear Pace thinks the young core of this team is good enough to be in serious contention over the next few seasons. With new head coach Matt Nagy at the helm, the Bears could be in store for a surprising, exciting season, even in a stacked NFC North.
20.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	9-7	|	Seattle's certainly going through a changing-of-the-guard, and not just on the offensive line. No one can act like it's no big deal that the defense lost four (maybe five?) superstars over the last 12 months, but the Seahawks have previously shown that superstars can be made out of underrated late draft picks. On one hand, veterans bring stability and knowledge. [On the other hand...](https://i.imgur.com/eDPK5wO.jpg)
21.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins | 	7-9	|	The Redskins go into 2018 with a lot of uncertainty. Nobody quite knows what to expect from Alex Smith and the rest of the offense. Preseason injuries have already quelled what little enthusiasm the fan base had and there still exists a lot of ill will over the mismanagement of talent during the off-season. Simply put, this team needs to win or they may be back to the same old revolving door of coaches and QB's who came to Washington and failed.
22.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	7-9	|	The Bengals, once again, retained Marvin Lewis in the off-season, a move that reinforces Mike Brown's love for the status quo. The Bengals may he slightly improved from last season, but likely not enough to be taken seriously as playoff contenders. Vegas has the win over/under at 6.5.
23.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	5-11	|	With a new quarterback, a revamped backfield, and a defense exchanging one criminal for another, the Denver Broncos look to improve off of their disastrous 5-11 campaign. Bronco Killers Alex Smith and Khalil Mack have gone East—where they can't hurt the Broncos anymore—creating a wide-open AFC West. Can the Broncos get back to the playoffs with Case? Or will the hopes of the mountain rest on $wag? Only time can tell.
24.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	3-13	|	New GM Dave Gettleman won the adoration of fans when he signed Odell Beckham Jr. to a long-term deal in the summer. That adoration, though, will quickly wear off if the Giants get off to a bad start in what's shaping up to be a brutal early season stretch of games. Time will tell if the moves done to address the OL were enough, and if the decision to keep Eli Apple in the starting lineup was a defensible one.
25.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	6-10	|	It is only fitting that the writer of this blurb is over 30 and was picked up off the street last minute. The players are saying the right things after the departure of Khalil Mack, but fans are going into week one feeling a bit like they've just been broken up with. A week one win would do a lot to raise the spirits and restore faith in the new regime.
26.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	8-8	|	Many are counting the Cardinals out before the season begins, and Vegas has them tied for least wins with the Browns, Bills, and Jets. A coaching change, QB change, scheme change, and one of the league's toughest schedules makes some of that understandable, but nearly all the same pieces that made the team 8-8 last year are still intact. An opening home game against Washington should be a good indication of how the season may go.
27.	| [](/IND) | Colts |	4-12	|	After an off-season full of turnover as Colts GM Chris Ballard continues to remake the roster, projections and expectations are a mixed bag for the 2018 Colts. Pending Andrew Luck's continued health and a massive improvement in the coaching department, a 12-4 record and division title could be the ceiling of this young and talented squad. But question marks at WR, RB, and along each level of the defense could mean another top 10 draft pick come season's end.
28.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	6-10	|	It's easy to knock the team that spends the off-season tossing aside 3 Pro-Bowlers and bringing in some old war equipment and a receiver that only plays well during the part of the season that the Dolphins tend to watch from home, but the Dolphins are trying something that teams don't usually do, except for the Patriots: Building a team on players that want to work to win and put in the time during the week and during the off-season to win.  Nobody that hasn't been to the Dolphins camp thinks they have a chance, but oddly, everyone that visits says they have something special.  We'll see.
29.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	5-11	|	The good news is that the Buccaneers exited the NFL preseason with as many ACLs as they had when they started. The bad news is that they're facing a brutal schedule and starting the season without their top quarterback.
30.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 	9-7	|	After a brief 17 year misstep, the Buffalo Bills returned to their standard of excellence last year with a playoff berth in Sean McDermott’s first year as HC. The defense looks to be substantially improved, with the team retaining its elite secondary talent while adding several front seven players this off-season, so the fate of the season now lies in the hands of sophomore QB Nathan Peterman as well as the ability of newcomers at offensive line to step up and perform. A failure at either of these could very well spell disaster, but improvement from last year’s 9-7 record is highly doable if things go well for the Bills in these areas.
31.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	5-11	|	On this week's episode of Hey Darnold!, [Helga Pa-Mac-i](https://i.imgur.com/XRvBKSa.png) left no doubt that the future is now by naming Sam Darnold the week 1 starting QB and sending Teddy Two-Gloves to New Orleans for a 3rd-round pick. What does the season hold? It's all on Sam now. 
32.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	0-16	|	Can we make it all sixteen games with the same quarterback? Can we manage at least four wins? Can we make it all year with our head coach? History says no, but history is stupid. As the saying goes ""those who do not study history are totally OK and things work out great"". Buckle up Browns fans, its 2018!

They have 50 million in cap space next season that they can use to address some of their issues, but i don’t think anyone excepts Allen to take over next year and set the world on fire immediately , so even more assets would be useful for the future than a 31 year old RB.

Looking ahead, here are some players that may earn their first trip this season.

######**transcendent rookies**

**RB Saquon Barkley, N.Y. Giants**

Okay so Barkley is hardly ""anonymous,"" as one of the highest profile rookie running backs in years. In fact, I ranked him as [the greatest running back prospect of the entire 2000s](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/72ky1d/where_does_saquon_barkley_rank_among_the_best_rb/?st=jlnz4oy8&amp;amp;sh=499d1bbb). 

There are some hurdles to overcome in New York -- including an inconsistent offensive line. That said, he's going to get as much work as he can handle. You'd presume Barkley will flirt with 1500 total yards as long as he can stay healthy, which will put him firmly in the Pro Bowl mix.

**OG Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis**

Similarly, # 6 pick Quenton Nelson is one of the [greatest prospects at his position](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8269ar/where_does_quenton_nelson_rank_among_the_best/) in the past several decades. That speaks to his skill set, but also gives him an immediate reputation and a high profile. For most guards, it takes years to earn yourself Pro Bowl recognition. Nelson will be under that spotlight right away. Based on his resume, you presume he'll deliver on that opportunity.

######**super sophomores**

**DE Myles Garrett, Cleveland**

The easiest pick on the board, Myles Garrett is not only a Pro Bowl candidate -- he's a Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Let's not waste much time on this one.

**DT Jonathan Allen, Washington**

After arriving with a great resume at Alabama, Jonathan Allen appeared to be one of the most ""pro ready"" rookies in his class. He played fairly well (78.2 grade on PFF) before an injury derailed his rookie season after only 5 games. 

Now that he's back and joined up with fellow Alabama DL Da'Ron Payne, Allen and the Redskins defense have the opportunity to take a major step up this year. It's never easy for linemen like Allen to rack up gaudy stats, so the 'Skins team success may be vital for him to stay on the national radar.

Meanwhile, I'd list Allen's college teammate Reuben Foster as a similar first time Pro Bowler himself, if not for a 2 game suspension to start the year. In fact, Foster is *so* good that he may get it anyway.

**DB Jamal Adams, N.Y. Jets**

Like Jon Allen, Jamal Adams had been seen as the ""can't miss"" prospect of his class. He immediately became the face of the Jets' defense. Adams had a strong debut (63 tackles, 3 sacks) but to take that next step, he'll need to increase his turnovers (0 interceptions). Even if he doesn't, I suspect Adams will rack up 100 tackles and maintain the type of profile that will keep him in consideration.

**CB Desmond King, L.A. Chargers**

A mere R5 pick, Desmond King stands in contrast to our other bluechip talents. At least, in terms of pedigree. In terms of actual football skill? The kid is elite. He was a four-year starter at Iowa who translated that success to the Chargers immediately, racking up a PFF grade of 85.7, 8th best among all cornerbacks.

For an unheralded talent like King, team success is important in terms of elevating his profile. He should find that with the Chargers. Personally, I ranked them as the [best team in the NFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/9btrpp/2_x_32_minute_drill_complete_preseason_rankings/?st=jlnzkwl2&amp;amp;sh=55ca6202), largely on the strength of their defense. In fact, the team could have as many as SIX Pro Bowlers on defense alone. Three of those are likely -- bookends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, as well as CB Casey Hayward. But Desmond King, LB Denzel Perryman (a sturdy run stuffer), and rookie safety Derwin James are all darkhorses themselves.

**RB Joe Mixon, Cincinnati**

An electric talent out of Oklahoma, Joe Mixon didn't exactly light the world on fire as a rookie. That said, he was playing behind a raggedy ass offensive line in Cincinnati. If the Bengals' additions this offseason (including LT Cordy Glenn and rookie C Billy Price) can help settle that unit, Mixon should benefit in a major way. He's an explosive back who can also be a fluid receiver out of the backfield. 

######**breakthrough vets**

**OG Shaq Mason, New England**

Quite frankly, I'm surprised Shaq Mason wasn't a Pro Bowler *last* season. The 25 year old graded as the 4th best guard on PFF, and plays for a team that has a large national profile. If he follows that up with a similar year, he should be a lock. 

**DE Chris Jones, Kansas City**

Like Shaq Mason, Chris Jones probably deserved to make the Pro Bowl last season. He had 6 sacks as an end in a 3-4 (not easy to do), and graded a 89.7 on PFF's scale, 7th best for his position.

The challenge for players like Jones (and Jonathan Allen) is that their positions don't lend themselves to stats. That said, sites like PFF really do help boost their public profile among savvier voters. If Jones can keep improving his play into that elite territory, he'll be hard to ignore for long.

**FS Lamarcus Joyner, L.A. Rams**

If not for an injury, Lamarcus Joyner may have made this list himself. He's a little spark plug and natural playmaker for the position, frequently making splash plays all over the field. PFF graded him at 90.9, the 2nd highest ranking for his position last year.

At 27 and soon to be 28, Joyner's finally ready for his breakout moment and spotlight. Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh should supply the pressure up front, allowing Joyner to benefit with some big plays on the back end.

**WR Marvin Jones, Detroit**

This one is more of a projection than certainty, but I'm high on the chances for Marvin Jones to break out this season. He was seen as a solid # 3 WR in Cincinnati, and now a solid # 2 in Detroit. But my question is: what if he's even better than that?

The stats would tend to suggest as much. Last season, the 28-year-old Jones logged 1101 yards and 9 touchdowns -- on only 108 total targets. That rate (10.2 yards per target) is an elite number. And it's not a total fluke either. He had registered 7.9 and 9.0 the prior two seasons. 

Marvin Jones is part of an evenly balanced receiving core (and tends to play more of the deep threat role), but there should be plenty of passes to go around this year. I anticipate Matt Stafford zipping the ball all over the field this season, and perhaps leading the league in passing yardage. If 120 or 130 of those targets go to Marvin Jones, he'll put up the type of numbers that can lead to his first Pro Bowl trip.

1527	Why aren’t more extensions filled with clauses?	"I thought of this during the Julio holdout and dez Bryant being cut. A lot of falcons fans complained that if Julio wanted more money, he should have more tds and dez signed a big contract he wasn’t performing too. So why not just sign a contract that is based on how you perform based on your stat average leading up to the negotiation?

Ex. Say Julio is getting his new contract in 2018, say he gets a base of 14 mil a year, over 5 years and half is fully guaranteed

Say a clause in the contract says he must hit these numbers which happen to be his career averages

84 catches 
1300 yards
6 tds


Once he hits all those he gets extra money per milestone. That way he gets his money as long as he performs, and if he doesn’t, the front office doesn’t have to pay all that dough for no production, a la dez bryant.

I don’t know how money games you have to play  in order to have considered playing the season, but if your injured and miss the year, you get that year fully guaranteed, but with no bonuses.

So, the question is what do you do with your camera during the game?  I want to get some good pregame shots and an occasional one during the game.  But, I don't want to be holding onto the camera the whole game.  I'll bring a clear plastic bag and some padding to put it in, but there is always the concern of theft or damage if you aren't constantly watching the bag and keeping it close.

If Mack lined up opposite the left tackle, the tight end would shift left. The Saints called it “Mack Protection” in the gameplan that week.

* DAL
* WAS
* DET
* SEA

**Tier 4: Teams that can have a big jump in play due to offseason moves and come out of nowhere to be good. These are the high ceiling and low floor teams:**

* CHI
* IND
* CIN
* NYG
* ARI


**Tier 5: Teams that are not expected to make the playoffs and you wouldn't be surprised if they had a losing season:**

* DEN
* CLE
* BUF
* MIA
* NYJ

1617	[OC] How the NFL's trend to 2 QBs may be to the XFL's benefit	"As we've all noticed over the last few weeks, the NFL is continuing a league-wide trend towards two quarterbacks (rather than the old standard of three.) 

There are a few reasons for this, of course. For one, teams have started to realize the importance of keeping their players fresh by using them in rotations -- especially along the defensive line. Those roster spots, often ""wasted"" on a 3rd QB that doesn't play, can be better utilized elsewhere.

Secondly, there's a sober realization that if you *are* down to your 3rd quarterback, chances are that you're in trouble regardless. A backup may be able to keep you afloat (or win you the Super Bowl, apparently) but a 3rd QB who gets limited reps will have a hard time keeping the team competitive. 

This trend may actually benefit side leagues like the XFL (allegedly starting again in 2020) or the proposed AAU (Alliance of American Football.) While Vince McMahon may believe he can capture a market by cool camera angles and more violence, the key to garnering interest has always been, and will always be, the QB position. Fans here on reddit may take about the Khalil Mack trade or the Jalen Ramsey comments, but they don't move the needle for casual fans who only know the stars.

Obviously, the XFL (or AAF) won't be able to land the Tom Bradys or Aaron Rodgers of the world. Trying to out-bid the NFL for them (like the UFL attempted to do in the 80s) will only lead to bankruptcy.

However, these smaller leagues have an opportunity ahead of them: **become a developmental league** for players who aren't getting that time and attention in the NFL. Well-trained offensive linemen are in the highest demand, but there's also a niche market for younger quarterbacks who need time to adjust to the ""pro"" game.

The NFL has the time and patience for young and raw quarterbacks that they deem franchise worthy talents (like a Blake Bortles or Mitchell Trubisky), but if you're *not* seen as the future starter, you're out of luck. Among the fringe young bucks who have found themselves on the unemployment line recently include: Davis Webb (R3 pick in 2017), Cardale Jones (R4 pick in 2016), Christian Hackenberg (R2 pick in 2016), and Paxton Lynch (R1 pick in 2016). 

In the NFL, you're either...

a) the future (or present) starter

b) a competent backup

c) or you're out.

Those trimmed down rosters are creating a larger supply of quarterbacks, with less demand for their services. Quarterbacks like these could funnel into side leagues like the XFL or AAF and attempt to develop their habits with real pro coaches. All the players mentioned are 25 or younger; they still have upside in the tank. 

Will they actually develop that? Probably not. But possibly. And if that happens -- if say, Davis Webb turns out to the league MVP of the XFL in a couple of years -- then they're going to start acquiring newfound interest from the ""big boys"" again. Fans of teams in need of QBs will be scouring college first and foremost, but also keeping an eye on the fringe leagues to see if a star may emerge. It's not unheard of either: Warren Moon, Doug Flutie, and Kurt Warner all thrived in different leagues before becoming good starters in the NFL.

In my mind, developing young QBs like that is the best path forward for the relevance of these side leagues. There may be some temptation to chase a ""Big Three"" model, where NBA wash-outs are playing 3-on-3 and actually doing decent ratings on Fox Sports. Perhaps there's some opportunity there to go for the ""biggest name"" and try to pay some big name retired player like Kurt Warner a few million to captain a team. In my opinion, that's a gimmick that won't last over the long haul. 

Perhaps there's a compromise between the two where the XFL chases big college stars who *still* have some youth and NFL potential (like Johnny Manziel, or Robert Griffin III if he ended up cutting cut at some point), but the key would still be signing players with some actual chance of becoming an NFL player again. 

Football fans crave the sport, the more the better, but the more the XFL or AAF can do to serve a viable function (as opposed to becoming a side show), the more sustainability and utility they'll have."	nfl

1623	OC: Can you pay top dollar for 2 players and Contend?	"So after the Mack trade, I have heard a lot of ""you can't tie up that much salary between 2 players and be successful"". I was curious if this was true, so I pulled the Salary Cap (SC) data for the last 3 years and the teams that made the playoffs. I chose playoff teams because, when it comes to winning the Super Bowl, and the NFL playoff system, there is too much luck involved.

First part I will look at are the teams that made the playoffs in 2015, 2016, AND 2017. Those teams are New England, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City.

The average salary cap % for the two largest contracts on each team by year:

**New England:**

2015- 15.7%

2016- 15.1%

2017- 15%

Average 15.3%

**Pittsburgh:**

2015- 18.4%

2016- 24.8%

2017- 18.8%

Average 20.7%

**Kansas City:**

2015- 16.4%

2016- 19.6%

2017- 22.9%

Average 19.6%

Three teams have made the playoffs in each of the years looked at. Kansas City and Pittsburgh have both gotten close to 20% of salary cap being shared between two players. New England is an anomaly, and has the best QB of all time playing at a discounted rate. It is hard to gauge how the team would be built if Brady received his true market value. The thing that these teams have in common is that they all had veteran QB's that are arguably top 10. Most likely the Green Bay Packers would have been part of this list if Rodgers had stayed healthy last year. 

The list is also littered with teams that have high salary cap usage between two players, as well as having the benefit of having a top 15 QB on a rookie contract (Seattle, Rams, Tennessee, Houston, Philly, Oakland, Minnesota, and Carolina).

The teams that had the highest SC % usage were:

2015 Denver - 20.5%

2015 Carolina - 22.1%

2015 Green Bay - 20.4%

2016 Pittsburgh - 24.8%

2016 Dallas - 21.2%

2016 Atlanta - 25%

2016 Seattle - 21.6%

2016 Green Bay - 20.2%

2016 New York G - 22.2%

2016 Detroit - 22.5%

2017 Kansas City - 22.9%

2017 Atlanta - 22.4%

12/36 playoff teams had a SC % Usage of over 20% for their top 2 paid players.

After looking at everything, I don't see how this can be a blanket statement that is used as an excuse to not sign a top player. Mack and Carr would have averaged 21% of their teams cap % for 2018-2021 (using Mack's Chicago contact). This % could be lower, but since negotiations never happened between Oakland and Mack, we don't know the exact figures of a contract that he would have sought. 

What we do know is that Oakland has struggled to bring in additional talent around Carr and Mack on both sides of the ball, since they have been drafted. Cooper and Crabtree have been the only two consistent offensive weapons. And defensively not many have stood out. This is due to poor drafting, giving contracts to Free Agents that haven't panned out, and some bad luck. Carr is a top 10 QB, and it would be more evident if they had a defense that would allow Carr to play with a lead. And when the Raiders do have a lead, a running game that could help manage the clock.

There is more than one way to build a team to make the playoffs and sustain long-term success. Very few teams ever figure it out, which is why dynasties are rare. Giving up known, high-caliber, talent isn't the best way to do it. You can't blame the players for earning big contracts. You have to put the blame on management for not finding the right players to fit a team. Year in and year out Green Bay, New England, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, etc. find ways to build their team to get to the playoffs. There isn't one formula, and there is a ton of risk.

At the end of the day, I think Oakland made a mistake, and I am glad Chicago was able to capitalize. Maybe they suck, maybe they get to the crapshoot that is the playoffs and make a run within the next 4 years. They took the risk. Oakland is taking a risk and they are going to try and find another defensive anchor in the draft. I believe in throwing good money at a known quantity versus gambling in the draft.

1634	Why doesn’t the NFL expand the roster size? With so much emphasis on not playing injured players, additional spots could help alleviate “playing through the pain” as well as have other benefits.	"Injuries are such a major factor for successful teams, additional players on game day and on the roster would help teams have options to go forward. 

Also more specialists could be on teams, instead of relying on one guy who’s a jack of all traits to back up multiple positions, they could go for things like a specialist pass rusher. 

teams could truly try to build the best team and not have to make a decision over having a backup or not for say center. 

I’m sure there are plenty of reasons for and against and I would love to hear them.

1635	How true is the Rodgers' criticism for taking too many sacks? Over the past 3 years, Rodgers' is 5th in passer rating (sacks not calculated), but 13th in ANY/A right next to Derek Carr (takes sacks into account). Over that span, he's 5th in sacks taken per game among 30 qualified QBs.	Just thought it was shocking how low Rodgers was in ANY/A given the amount of support he has as the best QB going into next season.  He had a big down year in 2015, and although Lacy regressed hard, and Jordy was injured with Adams not playing at the level he is at right now, he also had a line of Bakhtiari/Sitton/Linsley/Lang/Bulaga, which is ridiculous, and his defense wasn't bad.  Then 2016 he bounced back, but wasn't quite elite, still in that great tier, and then this past tier, he got injured, but wasn't phenomenal either, even before the injury, still in that good-great area.  I think it's interesting  to think if he can get back into that truly elite, All-Pro area this upcoming year with Adams looking much better, Graham added, and a souped up defense (though his interior line was stripped), or if he'll stick around in that 3-5 area of great, but not elite QBs.	nfl

1637	NFL 2010s All-Decade Team predictions	"In case you didn't know, there is an ""All-Decade Team"" selected by the members of the HoF at the end of each decade. Because there is only 2 seasons remaining, it is mostly possible to already predict who is going to be in the First Team and the Second Team.

I based my choices on the following criteria :

* Longetivity (Going through injuries, not missing games)
* Awards (All-Pro selections, Pro Bowls, MVPs, OPOYs, DPOYs)
* Statistical production
* Pro Football Focus Grades
* Consistency

Keep in mind that is list isn't just based on past 8 seasons, but also based on who I predict can still play at a high level in the next two seasons.

1649	The last player to be traded for two first round draft picks before Mack was Jay Cutler, here's what happened to all the picks in the infamous trade	"Before the 2009 season, after not meshing with head coach Josh McDaniels, the Broncos traded Jay Cutler and Seattle's 2009 5th to the Bears for the Bears' 2009 1st, 2009 3rd, and 2010 1st. The story of these picks is actually pretty dang interesting!

##Seahawks' 2009 5th

The only pick sent to the Bears from the Broncos, the Broncos got the pick by trading receiver Keary Colbert to the Seahawks. Colbert didn't even last all of 2008 with the Seahawks. The pick ended up being 140.

**[](/CHI) Chicago Bears Select, 140th Overall**: Johnny Knox, WR, Abilene Christian 

Knox made the Pro Bowl his rookie year in 2009 and was one of the team's leading receivers in their 2010 run to the NFC Championship Game. However, in 2011 he suffered a severe spinal cord injury and never played again.

##Bears' 2009 1st

This pick was straightforward, traded to the Broncos. It ended up being the 18th overall.

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 18th Overall**: Robert Ayers, DE, Tennessee

Ayers was a disappointment as a first round pick, but was a decent player for a few years. He played with the Broncos through 2013, when they won the AFC Championship. Ayers played for the Giants in 2014 and 2015, then the Buccaneers in 2016 and 2017 before retiring.

##Bears' 2009 3rd

The Bears' 2009 3rd was then traded to the Steelers for the Broncos' 2009 3rd, for the Steelers' 2009 2nd and 4th. The Steelers' 2nd ended up being 64th overall, the Broncos' 3rd 79th overall, the Bears' 3rd 84th overall, and the Steelers' 2nd 132nd overall.

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 64th Overall**: Richard Quinn, TE, North Carolina

**[](/PIT) Pittsburgh Steelers Select, 79th Overall**: Kraig Urbik, G, Wisconsin

**[](/PIT) Pittsburgh Steelers Select, 84th Overall**: Mike Wallace, WR, Ole Miss

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 132nd Overall**: Seth Olsen, OT, Iowa

Easily the best player from this bunch is Mike Wallace, the only player still in the league. None of the other players spent more than two years with the team that drafted them. Wallace had a touchdown in the Steelers' loss in Super Bowl XLV.

##Bears' 2010 1st

And here is where it gets *crazy*. A lot of the teams in these trades would make the Super Bowl this decade.

The Broncos traded the Bears' 2010 1st for the 49ers' 2010 1st, and the 49ers' 2010 4th.

**[](/SF) San Francisco 49ers Select, 11th Overall**: Anthony Davis, OT, Rutgers

Davis played four years in San Francisco, starting for them in Super Bowl XLVII. Remember the 49ers 4th for a minute.

The Broncos then traded the 49ers' 2010 1st for the Eagles' 2010 1st, the Seahawks' 2010 3rd, and the Eagles' 2010 3rd. I'm not going to go into how the Eagles had the Seahawks' pick, but just roll with it.

Then, Baltimore traded the Ravens' 2010 1st for the Dolphins' 2010 2nd (the Broncos had it), Seahawks' 2010 3rd, and the Broncos' 2010 4th. Okay, more players!

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 25th Overall**: Tim Tebow, QB, Florida

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 43rd Overall**: Sergio Kindle, LB, Texas

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 70th Overall**: Ed Dickson, TE, Oregon

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 114th Overall**: Dennis Pitta, TE, BYU

Yes, Tebow. Now the most notable players are the two TEs selected by the Ravens who both won Super Bowl XLVII. Dickson is still in the league on the Seahawks.

Okay, then with the Eagles' 2010 3rd...

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 87th Overall**: Eric Decker, WR, Minnesota

Decker just retired after eight years as a wide receiver in the league, being part of the Broncos' record breaking AFC Championship winning offense in 2013.

Now, with the 49ers' 2010 1st, the Eagles took...

**[](/PHI) Philadelphia Eagles Select, 13th Overall**: Brandon Graham, DE, Michigan

This was a great pick, Graham is still on the Eagles and proud owner of a snazzy Super Bowl LII ring.

The Broncos traded the Eagles' 2010 1st and 49ers 2010 4th with the Patriots for the Patriots' 2010 1st. 

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 113th Overall**: Aaron Hernandez, TE, Florida

Yep.

The Patriots traded the Eagles' 2010 1st and Patriots' 2010 4th to the Cowboys for the Cowboys' 2010 1st, and Cowboys' 2010 3rd.

**[](/DAL) Dallas Cowboys Select, 24th Overall**: Dez Bryant, WR, Oklahoma State

Good pick, Dez was a great player. The Cowboys traded the Patriots' 2010 4th and look, that got traded to Miami, and whatever.

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 27th Overall**: Devin McCourty, S, Rutgers

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 90th Overall**: Taylor Price, WR, Ohio

Price flamed out of the league, playing most of his career in Jacksonville. McCourty is now a veteran on the Patriots, and Super Bowl XLIX and LI champion.

Okay, so that leaves one last pick, the Patriots' 2010 1st in the hands of the Broncos

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 22nd Overall**: Demaryius Thomas, WR, Georgia Tech!

WON THE TRADE. Thomas is the last member of the legendary 2013 Broncos offense, Super Bowl 50 champion, and all around cool guy.

##The Finale

So, here's what the Bears got:

**Traded to [](/CHI) Chicago Bears**: Jay Cutler, QB

**[](/CHI) Chicago Bears Select, 140th Overall**: Johnny Knox, WR, Abilene Christian 

Here's what the Broncos ended up getting:

**Traded to [](/DEN) Denver Broncos**: Kyle Orton, QB

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 18th Overall**: Robert Ayers, DE, Tennessee

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 64th Overall**: Richard Quinn, TE, North Carolina

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 132nd Overall**: Seth Olsen, OT, Iowa

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 25th Overall**: Tim Tebow, QB, Florida

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 87th Overall**: Eric Decker, WR, Minnesota

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 22nd Overall**: Demaryius Thomas, WR, Georgia Tech

To my surprise, in football there is no ”minutes played” or ”time on field” stat to be found for each player of a team. Thus I wonder if there is any way to figure out how playing times are distributed between players in their respective defensive and offensive lineups in football? All suggestions are appreciated.

Manning has played with significantly better skill position talent and overall team talent. 

Team success is where Manning has the edge. But it’s not like Brady who blows him and every body really except Otto graham out of the water. Arod was 1 title/ SB appearance while Manning has two titles and 4 appearances.  But arod has one of the greatest playoff runs in history in his Super Bowl title run while manning sucked in both of his championship runs. The first one he had a 70 passer rating with 3 tds to 7 picks while the second he was carried by a top 20 defense in history.  

Generally Rodgers has been better in the playoffs and his teams haven’t been as big a disappointment. The packers have only loss one time as a favorite, and that was to the giants. The colts/Broncos made that a yearly routine 

Both their teams being crap when they got hurt."	nfl

1761	Why do old QBs seem to fall off a cliff?	"With most other positions it's pretty obvious why players have to retire; as they age their physical skills decline, hits take a toll, and their bodies break down. On the other hand QBs can play into their late 30s and even early 40s and have as much success as they did at their physical peak. In fact QBs actually seem to peak at a time when most RBs are reaching the end of their career (age 28-30). And yet old QBs often seem to all of a sudden fall off a cliff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two example are Brett Favre - at age 40 he had 33 TD, 7 INT, and a 107.2 passer rating, then the next year he had 11 TD, 19 INT, and a 69.9 passer rating. Peyton Manning at age 38 had 35 TD, 15 INT and a 101.5 passer rating, and then the next year he had 9 TD, 17 INT, and a 67.9 passer rating.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you think this happens? I think it's probably a combination of things. The physical element has an effect - even though not as much as on other players, the decline in skills coupled with years of hits probably takes its toll. QBs are able to overcome this with their mental game, but just as it seems like players get to a point where the game clicks and everything ""slows down,"" there also seems to be a point where the game ""speeds up"" and players can't keep up anymore mentally. So all of a sudden for QBs they have to overcome their declining physical skills but don't have the mental edge to do it. So we see a drastic drop off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of the 22 contracts handed out, 13 of the teams ended up winning more games after signing the player than before.  Overall, teams averaged 0.75 more wins per season after handing out top-5 Edge money   

Interestingly enough, no team in the last 10 years has won a SB within 2 years of paying an Edge rusher the big money.  Only 1 team in the last 10 years ever won a SB again after those big contracts; the 2012 Ravens   

**TLDR** Overall, teams who hand out top-5 Edge contracts have won about 1 more game per season afterwards.   This analysis is simply a starting point and there are tons of factors in building a great team, but I found it interesting and figured you would too

1855	[Rules] Help solve Punt Fumble Debate please	"Team A Punts from the 50.

Team B Punt Returner muffs punt on Team B's 8 Yard line and after muffed contact the ball rolls out of the back of Team B's own end zone. He did not catch the ball fully, for the sake of debate it could've even hit their leg after the ball bounced. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process is possession is flipped on a punt once the ball is touched by the returning team, the ruling is now a safety since the ball rolls out of the endzone.

&amp;#x200B;

Others are saying touchback b/c the returner didn't possess the football, but on a punt doesn't a touch initiate the possession change?

&amp;#x200B;

1900	I read about the NFL's 'disaster draft' procedures today. Both interesting and a little disturbing	"&gt; National Football League
The National Football League (NFL)'s contingency plan provides for both a ""near-disaster"" and a ""disaster"". A ""near-disaster"" is defined as fewer than 15 players on a team being disabled, and a ""disaster"" is 15 or more.

&gt; No special draft would be held for a ""near-disaster""; the team would instead get preferential rights on any waivers until the end of the season. If a quarterback is among the fewer than 15 lost, the team would be able to draft up to two quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each team would be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.

&gt; For a ""disaster"", the commissioner would determine whether to cancel the team's schedule for the season. If the team's season is canceled, the team would have the first pick in the next regular draft; a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players. If not canceled, the ""near-disaster"" procedures would be used."	nfl

For example, Trent Richardson back in 2012 was compared to the likes of AP but spent just three years in the NFL. Never surpassed his 950 yard, 11 TD rookie campaign. Cedric Benson, Cadillac Williams, Darren McFadden were all high pickers that never panned out either. Also, let's remember that there isn't much of a skill difference between RB's in the early rounds compared to those taken later in the draft. I love Barkley and his amazing potential but nothing's to be guaranteed. Personally to be completely honest - I don't see him being a franchise changer for the Giants. At least not anytime soon.	nfl

1943	2018 Excel Office Pool Pick 'Em &amp; Stat Tracker	"Hi /r/nfl, 

Below is an NFL Pick 'Em Excel workbook for 2018. This was originally created for an office league and being that it's Excel it allowed me to manage/update the sheet during my downtime at work. (I'm sure other people work in places where all the good websites are blocked.) The worksheet has been well received the few last years so I thought I'd post it here again in case anyone is looking to use it.

If you're not familiar with it, here's some pictures of it in action, a primer on how to use the sheet, and the dropbox link to download it:

[Stats](http://i.imgur.com/kjExTvc.png)

[Hypothetical - Week 1 results from 2017](https://i.imgur.com/L7AYyYo.png)

It's a fairly straight forward workbook.  The first sheet, Picks, has the full schedule already included.  The info it needs from you is the **spreads** you intend to use, the final **score** of each game, and the **pick** for each participant.  If you want to pick straight up winners then you can leave all the spreads blank and it will still function just fine.  All of the times are shown in CST. 

The second sheet houses all of the statistics.  At the top you can enter a range of seasons/weeks for stats you'd like to see.  It's set up for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons. 

The next few pages display the various statistics based on your previous selection.

They have a promising QB on a rookie contract, two great backs, some actual receivers this year, and the potential to have a top 5 defense with studs at every level.

What are your realistic expectations? What is there window?

2017	[OC] Jason Verrett Part 2: Detailing His Injuries &amp; The Mentality Underlying Them	"Hey everyone, this is part 2 of my piece on Jason Verrett where I get into underlying factors of his achilles rupture, the mentality that connects all his injuries, and his career prospects

### B. Underlying factors that weakened the achilles

#### 1 – Over-Use

“Too much, too soon” is one of the most common causes of soft tissue injury in general, including for the achilles. If there’s a sudden ramp up or overall increase in activity, the tendon gets overloaded with stress and weakens.

By all accounts, the Chargers were being very conservative with Jason Verrett in his recovery but it’s still possible that the extent or intensity of training ramped up too quickly.   That’s especially tangible with a player like Jason Verrett who isn’t one to just do things half-heartedly.

Chargers GM Tom Velesco echoed that sentiment:

&gt; “He was healthy in the offseason program and we were probably more cautious than we had to be. We probably held him back, and he probably wanted to do a lot more. We tried to gently ramp him up, just on volume. But he’s a competitive player.”

&gt;  

&gt; “He’s full go. He wants to be full go.”

In my experience with athletes, one of the toughest challenges is reigning in their intensity and activity level as they recover from injury. Most have been taught to always train at 100%, no matter what.  This mentality sets you up for a setback and risk of new or re-injury.

#### 2 – Fatigue

[Multiple studies have linked fatigue to increasing the risk of achilles tear.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3752187/)

For Jason Verrett, the months leading up his achilles rupture were the highest level of activity that he’d had for years.  After tearing his ACL the first time, he didn’t participate much in summer OTAs or training camp because he was still coming along slowly.  Then after the second ACL tear, he was again in rehab.  He was finally cleared for full practices in mid-June and was working really hard – think back to those earlier quotes from cornerbacks coach Ron Milus about Verrett’s speed and burst being back to pre-injury levels.

That speed and burst comes with more energy expenditure and higher fatigue, especially if you aren’t used to doing them for extended periods of time.  For that reason, fatigue could have played a factor in the achilles tendon rupture.

#### 3 – Changed bio-mechanics &amp; compensation following an ACL tear

The unfortunate reality with an ACL tear (or any injury really, but even more so with severe injuries) is that it doesn’t just affect the knee.  It changes the mechanics of that leg and leads to compensations, both physical and mental.

This speaks to how inderdependent the human body is – every body part mutually relies on the others, like links in a chain.  When one is affected, it indirectly affects the others as well.

https://imgur.com/tJdEXe0

As I mentioned earlier, we know an ACL tear [increases the tear risk for the non-injured ACL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27215935)due to compensations and altered mechanics.  Additionally, there are side to side differences in strength, stability, and proprioception (the proprioceptive system is how your brain unconsciously knows where your body parts are in space) between the injured and non-injured leg for [up to 2 years post surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535266).

These changes can easily result in changed mechanics and compensatory patterns, with other muscles and tendons, like the achilles tendon (the largest tendon in the body), having to take on a greater share of responsibility.  Over time, those muscles and tendons can become overloaded and start to weaken or degenerate (“career burnout”).

We’ll never know if that was the case with Jason Verrett but it’s reasonably possible.  He had 2 straight years of ACL rehab and he and his coaches openly commented on how he didn’t look right, mentally or physically, until the end of the 2nd year of rehab.

If his achilles tendon was taking on more stress throughout that time, it could have weakened and decreased it’s tolerance to load, with that final push-off equating to the straw that broke the camel’s back.

So those are some underlying possibilities for why his achilles tendon couldn’t handle that final push-off during conditioning.  Lets now transition to the recovery, starting with surgery:

## VI. Achilles Tendon Repair

Although there’s still debate as to whether a non-operative (conservative) or operative (surgical) approach is optimal following an achilles rupture (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21969435), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21037028), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17885221), [here](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract-text/23224384/pubmed), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20802094) for more info), surgery surgery is recommended for athletes (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20824836), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=22802271), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24013347), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27307495) for more info).

There are multiple types of achilles surgery but the goal is the same: re-connect the tendon and make sure the tension level is similar to where it was pre-injury.

Here’s one example of what surgery may look like (work-safe):

https://imgur.com/dMTMde3

After surgery is complete and the tendon reconnected, Jason Verrett moves onto rehab and recovery…

## VII. Jason Verrett return to play timeline

Research has shown that the [average return to play timeline after achilles rupture is roughly 6 months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26281836). However, NFL players [have taken about 11 months on average.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993)

That would peg Jason Verret’s return around June 2018.

Normally I’d go into the full details of his rehab but since this piece is already lengthy, I’m going to skip them and refer you to [this piece](https://theinjuryinsight.com/demarcus-cousins-achilles-rupture/) if you’re interested in the deets.  However, I do want to review some overlying macro factors that could influence Jason Verret’s recovery.

### Macro (contextual) factors

#### 1 – Family, team, and social support

Rehabbing from an injury as a professional athlete can be a very lonely place, let alone when you’re doing it for the third year in a row like Jason Verrett

It’s just you and the medical staff (often times the same person) for long periods of time, days on end.  Therefore, it’s really important to stay connected and have a support system to keep the spirits and motivation up.

Even though Verrett has been injured for the majority of his Chargers career, he’s still developed relationships and connections with the team throughout his tenure there.

For example, here’s what Chargers corner Jahleel Addae[ had to say](https://www.chargers.com/news/heartbroken-teammates-react-to-jason-verrett-s-achilles-injury):

&gt; “I saw what he went through to bounce back from his knee. I saw his loyalty and his dedication to the game, his family and to his craft. To see it happen like that in a conditioning test, I love him like a brother, so to see him go down with a freak injury, it’s tough. But we’ll be praying for him and we’ll be out there for him. Jason will bounce back”

Hopefully those bonds will help inflate his sail as he moves through the rehab process.

#### 2 – Resiliency and mindset

Jason Verrett has had a resilient and tough mindset in spades (arguably to the extreme) but again, this is his third major injury in as many years.  That will wear on any player, even the mentally strongest.

We haven’t heard from Jason Verrett himself but here’s how some of his [teammates &amp; coaches responded](https://www.chargers.com/news/heartbroken-teammates-react-to-jason-verrett-s-achilles-injury), starting with Chargers LB Denzell Perryman who spent last year rehabbing with Jason Verrett:

&gt; “I missed half the season last year, and he missed the whole one, and we went through the rehab phase together…to see him go down, it was devastating. It was sad. It was a comeback season for the both of us, so this hurts my heart. But he’s in my prayers and his family is in my prayers. I just wish him a speedy recovery.”

Additionally, there was Keenan Allen who himself has been through a stretch of brutal injuries:

&gt; “I’m very emotional over it. It’s hard to watch him go down like that after he worked so hard to come back this season. I know how tough it is. I’m just sending him prayers.”

Imagine how Verrett feels.

Coming off the back to back ACL repairs and now with the achilles tendon repair, this rehab is going to be the hardest one yet mentally so it’s critical that Verrett is able to maintain that resilient mindset rather than completely give into thoughts of despair and “why me”.

#### 3 – Contract Uncertainty

There’s never a good time for an achilles rupture but this one couldn’t have come at a worse time for Jason Verrett –  he’s in a contract year.

Contract years are especially critical in the NFL because of the non-guaranteed nature of NFL contracts  – you have to show out as much as possible to earn as much guaranteed money as possible.  Being in a contract year while injured naturally creates a lot of uncertainty for Jason Verrett.

Most humans don’t like uncertainty, especially financial uncertainty, and the feelings of “why me” are inherent, especially for Jason Verrett who has worked his entire life to play in the NFL, battled through constant injuries, finally felt like he was on the brink of being healthy…and then had the rug pulled out yet again.

These feelings of doubt and negativity can and will creep into rehab and negatively impact the healing environment if they aren’t dealt with swiftly.

Normally, I’d also be very concerned (considering his “all or nothing, by any means necessary” mentality) that Jason Verret would rush back and try to play this season in order to assuage team’s concerns and land a bigger deal.

However, it’s pretty much impossible for him to make it back this year. Even on the outside chance that the Chargers make the Super Bowl, (don’t @ me Chargers fans), that’s only slightly over 6 months from his injury to February weekend.  Like I said earlier, the [average return to play for NFL players after an achilles rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993) is 11 months.

So those are some macro layers of Jason Verrett’s recovery.  Once he does get back, what can we expect performance wise and for his future prospects?

## VIII. Long-Term Implications of Achilles Tendon Rupture

The long-term implications after an achilles rupture aren’t pretty.

Many studies have followed individuals after achilles rupture and the results don’t paint a rosy picture.  [Although 80% of individuals returned to following an achilles rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5136353/#R22), there’s evidence of long-term changes in muscle strength, endurance, muscle activity, ankle range of motion, and calf atrophy – for up to 10 years after the rupture (click [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Annegret_Muendermann2/publication/224006065_Deficits_10-Years_after_Achilles_Tendon_Repair/links/00b7d5182aecfc06d3000000/Deficits-10-Years-after-Achilles-Tendon-Repair.pdf), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229048), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511694), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26791028) for more info).  In the case of athletes involved in running, bio-mechanical and muscle deficits can persist for up to 4 years after the injury (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22282229), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570159), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17126970) for more info).

Additionally, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14723785) show there’s an increased risk of injuring the other leg as well.  25% of individuals develop knee or achilles issues on the non-surgical leg, with 6% actually rupturing the achilles on the non-surgical leg.

Further, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28644678) has also shed a light on performance effects after the athlete has returned to competitive play.

Of athletes who were able to play at least 2 seasons after returning from the achilles rupture (nearly 57% weren’t able to meet this criteria for a variety of reasons), they participated in significantly fewer games and had significant decreases in secondary measures of longevity and performance metrics after year 1.

HOWEVER, those athletes who were able to play 2 or more years were able to perform at a level commensurate with their non-injured counterparts.

Further, a [study came out last year that specifically looked at NFL players returning from achilles tendon rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993).  It found that 73% returned to play but on average went on to play a year less than their non-injured counterparts.

In terms of performance, running backs and linebackers took the biggest hit when comparing pre vs post surgery, and linebackers took a significant hit when comparing post-surgery production to non-injured linebackers.

**So here’s the reality for Jason Verrett after suffering an achilles rupture**:  Odds are that his first two years back will be subpar compared to his pre-injury level.  However, if he’s able to make it through those 2 years without a major setback,  he could return to being a high level corner.  Howevr, his previous ACL injuries are a huge confounding variable that could set him back even further.

Additionally, there’s one other variable that has worked against him throughout his NFL career…

## IX.  The “Grit and Bear It” Mindset

I’ve been dropping not so subtle hints about Jason Verrett’s mindset the entire way:

https://imgur.com/oi34UmW

Unfortunately, this mentality is still pervasive in sports (amongst coaches, players, and fans alike), especially in football (a recent prominent example is the [University of Maryland football coaching staff](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/sports/ncaafootball/maryland-suspends-dj-durkin.html)).  This mindset can lead to and/or exacerbate injuries and in the case of Maryland, [a player actually died](http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/24343021/jordan-mcnair-maryland-terrapins-died-heatstroke-team-workout).

It’s a common theme we saw from Jason Verrett with nearly every injury:

- Playing through an torn right labrum his senior year at TCU (which is actually the most understandable in my opinion because he was playing to get drafted)
- Trying to play through and get a cortisone shot with his injured left labrum and torn rotator cuff during his rookie year in SD
- Chalking up his partial ACL tear as just “normal soreness”
- Going all out during summer practices in the lead-up to his achilles rupture

This mindset of “just keep playing and giving it 100%, no matter what” is commendable to an extent but can quickly become a doubled edged sword.  Two other examples come to mind:

1. Kobe, in the lead-up to his own achilles rupture, severely sprained his ankle against the Hawks when Dahntay Jones undercut him on the final shot of the game (the Zaza school of defense). He came back from that injury way too quickly and went on to play multiple games without rest in order to get the team to the playoffs…until his achilles ruptured in the 3rd to last game of the season (I was at the game unfortunately). https://i.imgur.com/LJQ7jJs.png
2. Isiah Thomas played through a hip labrum tear to lead the Celtics deep into the playoffs (all the while dealing with his little sister’s sudden death.  The amount of flack he got this past year was ridiculous).  He was promptly rewarded by the Celtics by getting dealt to Cleveland where he tried to play himself back into game shape on the floor.  After a mid-season trade to the Lakers, his hip labrum eventually got irritated to the point that he had to shut it down and have surgery…in his contract year.  Instead of a potential max offer in free agency, [he got a 1 year, 2 million (vet minimum) “prove it” deal from Denver](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24081526/isaiah-thomas-agrees-1-year-deal-denver-nuggets).

It’s one thing to try and help the team by making plays, but it’s another thing to be overly reckless, be constantly putting yourself in high risk positions, and playing through constant pain.

I like to use the analogy of hearing a little rattle in your car.

You’re driving along and one day you hear a faint rattle in your car and instead of checking it out, tell yourself “ah it’s nothing, I’m sure it will just go away”. When the rattle gets louder, still “no big deal, the car is just getting older”.  Next thing you know, you go to hit third gear on the highway and your transmission falls out.  That person you shake your head at and give advice to while they’re stranded on the shoulder of the highway is now you.

This mentality is especially risky in the NFL – a sport without guaranteed contracts where most of the teams won’t think twice about cutting an injured player (it’s just business remember? Except when the player decides to make a decision for themselves…then it’s selfish, disloyal, traitorous, etc.  Oy vey).

All that being said, I don’t blame Jason Verrett for this underlying mentality – it’s apparent that football culture still prides itself on a “no pain, no gain, just suck it up and play” mentality.  You constantly hear coaches, commentators, and fans praising that attitude so it’s only natural that players are going to absorb that mentality as well.

You’d think that NFL medical staffs would step in but unfortunately these staffs aren’t independent which lends itself towards bias and feeling pressure to do what’s best for the team rather than the individual.

Verrett’s case certainly takes that mentality to the extreme and it hasn’t helped his career prospects by any means.

## X. All in All

Overall, an achilles rupture is a brutal injury – regardless of when it happens or who suffers it.

It could be especially devastating for Jason Verrett because it’s the third consecutive serious injury to his lower body and another extended rehab period.  That takes a toll physically and mentally, which is further compounded by a murky contract situation and overzealous, ambitious, “go 100% all the time” mindset

If Jason Verrett does get back to full health and is able to stay healthy, it very well may take him 2+ years to get back to his original form and his career is likely to be shorter than other cornerbacks.

I wish Jason Verrett all the best and I try to stay as optimistic as possible in writing these pieces but lets look at this objectively:

A player who plays with reckless abandon and doesn’t listen to his own body (reinforced by the culture of the league he plays in), coming off 3 straight very serious lower body injuries, each with short and long-term ramifications.  It’s hard not to be pessimistic.

Thanks for reading, until next time.  Feel free leave comments or ask questions like always.

What is the significance of this? Since 1983 (not a cherry-picked year; there is no data past 1983), there have been 33 teams to fail to cross the 44-point mark in the preseason. All 33 teams did not win a playoff game that season, and only 4 of them ended up making the playoffs.

Will this stat hold up? Two of these teams made the playoffs last year, and all three of them had a winning record and are good teams, so this will be interesting to see if the magic number holds up.

2103	This lovely lady bought a new AE86 in 1983 and has been driving it ever since.	"[**Instagram link with photos and video.**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnQXNMBlcUW/?taken-by=amandaae86)

""A chance encounter with one of the coolest 86 owners I’ve ever met!

Popped down to the shops for milk &amp; came across this 86, it’s owner happened to be returning to it at the same time.

Meet Marie. She bought this sprinter brand new in 1983 &amp; has owned it since. When she purchased it she knew it would be the only car she’d ever buy, 35 years later it’s still her daily driver. 
She drove it across the Nullarbor from Tasmania to WA &amp; in her 35 years of ownership it only broke down on her once &amp; she cried when it was put on the tow truck! 

She is very particular about it’s maintenance, with one mechanic looking after it for her all it’s life. She mentioned she only uses genuine Toyota parts except for when her air con broke she had to get a spurious motor which she wasn’t too happy about!! She adored her 86 &amp; it really showed, the car was immaculate inside and out. She told me she gets inundated with guys following her around offering her big money for the car but she will never ever sell it. We chatted for a while and she enjoyed hearing about my corolla too. 

An absolute lady and huge 86 enthusiast! People are meant to cross paths for a reason I guess, Marie you are one of a kind &amp; I was so fortunate to meet you. 

Truly my pleasure. Legend!❤️ #ae86 #toyota #respect"""	cars

2106	Comparing the 2018 Ford Fusion vs the 2018 Ford Edge – Or why the crossover is winning	"**TL;DR at bottom**

So here on /r/cars, there is this endless debate over crossovers versus sedans, what their perceived advantages and disadvantages are, and why one would buy a crossover over a sedan. Well today, I thought I’d dig deep into the crossover vs sedan comparison, and I’ll dig deep into comparing the Ford Fusion and the Ford Edge, two midsized cars made by the same company on the same platform.

So first of all, let’s look at Fuel economy: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=39545&amp;id=39296&amp;id=39552&amp;id=39299

A FWD Fusion gets 1mpg better than a FWD Edge with the same engine. AWD Fusions and Edges get the same fuel economy. So obviously fuel economy isn’t a concern when choosing between the two.

On paper, it is possible to get Fusions for cheaper. The lowest MRSP for a Fusion is $22,840 while the Edge starts at $29,315. However, the cheapest Fusion is equipped to a much lower standard than the cheapest edge (steel wheels, 2.5L naturally aspirated engine, etc) than the cheapest Edge. A mechanically identical Fusion and Edge are nearly identical in price (2.0L Ecoboost AWD SEL Trim), with the Fusion being $32,165 and the Edge being $32,040. 

Now from a size perspective, the two cars are nearly identical. Fusions are 191.7 inches long, and 72.9 inches wide, while Edges are 188.1 inches long (2 row version) and 75.9 inches wide. So yeah, the Fusion is 3 inches longer while the Edge is 3 inches wider. When it comes to parking and maneuverability, I don’t think the two would be much different, as they have nearly identical footprints.

The big difference comes down to practicality. Passenger wise, the Edge gets you a solid 113.9 cubic feet of passenger volume, while the fusion only has 102.8 cubic feet. The Edge gets better head and shoulder room on both the front and second rows. When it comes to leg room, the Fusion wins with 2 more inches of front leg room, but the Edge has 2 more inches of rear leg room. 

Now when it comes to practicality, the Edge wins, and by a long shot. You get 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 2nd row, while the Fusion only gets 16 cubic feet of space in the trunk. The Edge also becomes significantly more useful once you put down the 2nd row, while the fusion doesn’t improve by too much due to the trunk opening design.

Now the Fusion does win in 1 way, acceleration. The 2.7L Ecoboost Fusion makes it to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds, while the 2.7 Ecoboost Edge does it in 5.6. (Numbers from Car and Driver). Aside: how does the Edge get the same fuel economy despite more weight? Probably due to gearing, which contributes to worse acceleration

Shocking however, the Edge does not lose to the Fusion in handling. The best handling Fusion is the Fusion Sport, which corners at 0.84g, while the Edge Sport with the identical drivetrain corners at 0.83g. The standard Fusion Sport takes 178 feet to stop from 70mph to 0, a number the Edge, well, edges out the competition at 176 feet. Why did the Fusion lose to the Edge? The Edge Sport comes with 245s, while the Fusion Sport comes with 235s. Now Ford Performance does offer a tire upgrade to performance summer tires, allowing the Fusion Sport to pull 0.89g on the skidpad and stop from 70mph in 155 feet (again, performance data from Car and Driver). 

But here’s the thing with the performance numbers, the Fusion sport is $40,910 (without the optional performance tires), while the Edge Sport is $38,765. So you’re paying $2000ish for a car that accelerates better, but doesn’t brake or turn better. I’m pretty sure however, the Fusion’s advantage is fleeting, as next year once the Edge ST comes out, it should at least match the Fusion Sport’s performance in every way around the same price.

So yes, I fully understand why Edge sales are soaring every year, while Fusion sales are declining (and won’t see a next generation). The Edge is just blatantly a better car in every single regard besides acceleration, where the top trim fusion that’s $2000 more expensive is better (and the upcoming Edge ST might beat). 

Now I get it, the Edge is one of the better mid-sized SUVs, while the Fusion is around the middle of the pack when it comes to midsized sedans, but I think the same conclusion is playing out in dealerships of every single brand, where the crossover is beating the sedan in either every single aspect or maybe just losing a bit when it comes to performance figures while winning significantly in practicality at around the same price or just with a small premium. 

And this is why I don’t personally lament the death of the family sedan. The average family sedan is just a meddling, mediocre product, designed to get you from A – B, while the modern crossover is a much better way to get from A – b, with more head and shoulder room, alongside better practicality at a minimal performance and fuel economy loss. 

PS: What about wagons? Well considering that the Mondeo Estate and the Fusion Sedan are the same car outside of the 5th door, all my above conclusions still hold, since although the Mondeo Estate has slightly better practicality, the Edge still easily beats it. According to Ford UK, the Edge can load 800 liters with both rows up, the Mondeo Estate can only do 525 liters with both rows up.  

**TL;DR: The Edge is better than the Fusion in interior space and practicality, while being nearly identical in size, price, handling, and fuel economy. The only place where the Fusion is better than the mechanically identical Edge is acceleration.**"	cars

Somewhere around 450-500bhp and 600Nm at the moment, and all to the front wheels.

Still I found myself quite surprised at how violent and brutal it felt like, almost like the turbo-nutters from the 80's. I know it's supposed to have Ford Revo-knuckle and some clever diff-trickery, but it was quite hard to notice since it actually felt like fighting a heavyweight boxer. Loads of fun tho. Dangerous, but fun. I guess the closer you get to the treshold of actually dying, the more alive you feel...

Only thing that I've driven that felt this fast, is a F12 Berlinetta, but in some ways this bloody hatchback felt way more violent. To quote James May: ""It's not the power, it's the nature of the delivery."""	cars

Sexist?  I agree the salesman was gathering info and trying to deduce if she was actually serious but it was very very soon into the meet and greet..normal? 	cars
2115	When will manuals be gone?	"Ever since I was a kid I wanted a manual car, my first car was a 2012 dsg gti because the price was too good to pass up and my parents wouldnt let me get a manual. I valeted for a little bit and learned stick, the lust was becoming insatiable. Last month I bought myself a 2016 gti S 3 door w/lp,pp  that was 6 speed, every day is fun and I'm learning. 

Headlines constantly pop up which upset me but not a big deal- no coupe gtis, no base performance pack etc typical vw stuff.

But some stuck out, no more manual audis, no manual on the new GT500, hr-v losing manual, chevy cruze loses manual, even the gti is going to be dsg only in Australia.

I just wonder - how much longer until they stop producing manual transmission cars? Audi in the US fought to keep them, but sales weren't good. Theres the arguement that this is mostly for the US, but soon things might change worldwide. With Europe pushing for higher emissions standards EVs will be taking over, even in the land where manuals reign supreme. 
A shame that most people see driving as point A to point B, and not something fun, or something to get engaged in. People are too busy browsing instagram and texting to see it as anything but a car.
Its not a good feeling, when I'm older and I want a nice newer car with a third pedal, it may not be there. "	cars

2128	Stolen: 2006 Acura RSX S (NJ)	"First time here because my brother's car got stolen this morning, somewhere between 5:30am-8:00am. We live in a fairly safe area near Princeton, NJ. It was stolen from our town home parking lot. We're not entirely sure what to do. It is a Silver 2006 Acura RSX S, with no modifications or spoiler, everything is stock. We've had it for years. If anyone can keep an eye out for it, that'd be appreciated. If you see it, please contact me. It's a NJ license plate &amp; the first three digits of the license plate is ZHZ. There's a scuff mark on the rear right panel and a crack in the rear bumper. No other unique identifiers.

EDIT: Added license plate info &amp; physical description."	cars

2131	Photo of gift given to retiring Corvette test driver suggests C7 ZR1 lapped the Nurburgring in 6:57!?	"This was posted to the Corvette Forum today. 

https://i.imgur.com/dzkdpAf.jpg

Apparently Jim Mero, famed Corvette test driver, is retiring this week and a user got a facebook sourced photo that allegedly shows one of the retirement gifts...which is a photo collage of Corvettes and Jim's ring lap times. At the bottom has a photo of a C7 ZR1 with 6:57(S). 

The (S) probably stands for something and may have been a reason why no official times was released....let the speculation begin....

2133	How to sell a modified car?	"I own a 2002 rsx type s I bought for $6300 two years ago. I thought it was dope when I bought it, but I'm not so into it anymore. It's got a loud 3"" stainless exhaust, cold air intake, lowered on adjustable coilovers, sub, amp, stereo, window tint, red plastidip rims, and Michelin pilot sport 3+ tires. I just finished repainting it because the clear coat had started peeling and I had bought a new bumper that was still bare fiberglass. Also last winter, I drove it into a ditch which bent the lower rad support and you can tell through all the body lines in the front end. Anyways, all in I'm like $12k I guess. Now how the hell do I go about selling this? I know there's no chance of even getting what I payed for it, but what can I say to potential buyers to at least get them interested? Thanks"	cars

2135	Reasons you got the V6 instead of the V8	"I wanted a CTSV Coupe since I first came across the design. Fast forward almost a decade and I now have one, well a coupe, at least. For me it was 100% financial - my car was 15.2 OTD, while a comparable V would have cost double. On top of getting literally half the mpg, I just couldn't swallow that pill.   


I've had the coupe for only a few thousand miles, but I couldn't be more satisfied with the balance of power and comfort. It has the 3.6 with 305hp, so passing is still a breeze, and cruising is comfortable.      
  

Anyone have other reasons?

So I was wondering if anyone could help me find accurate exhaust videos for a couple cars because going around youtube, the different recording setups and compression often hide the truth.

Currently looking at E/C63 Amg, mustang gt/gt350, f type v6 and v8 and a vette.

Now obviously the f type and vette aren't as daily as the amg or the stang but I'd still like to consider them. So if anyone has any accurate exhaust videos of each or comparisons between 2 or more please post them"	cars

2157	Cylinders misfiring, but only when I drive into high altitudes. Anyone else experienced this?	"I have a ‘97 crv, and I live and spend most of my time between 5000 and 6000 feet, but a few months ago I drove up into the mountains and reached altitudes probably around 10,000-11,000 feet, and my check engine light came on. My OBD reader told me it was a cylinder misfire, and considering I had other stuff to fix I just cleared the check engine light and decided to fix it later, but the light didn’t come back on, so I figured it was a glitch.

That is, until I drove up to around 12,000-13,000 feet of elevation last Sunday, and it came on with the same problem. I swapped the spark plug from the problem cylinder to the neighboring cylinder so that if it comes back on, I’ll be able to tell if the spark plug was the problem based on whether the cylinder that’s misfiring changes, in the meantime, has anyone else experience these problems driving at high elevations before? Is there something else I could try?"	cars

2159	Got to drive a friend's 2017 Camaro ZL1 on track (vid link in text)	"Had the opportunity to drive a friend's 2017 Chevy Camaro ZL1 auto trans on track Sunday and I thought I'd do a little write up for anyone interested.   

First, I'd like to give a bit of driving experience background on myself, just so you know where my feedback is coming from. (If you don't GAF, just skip this paragraph).  I've been involved with track days and racing since 2003.  I've tracked several cars, including 2006 Lotus Elise, a 2003 Nissan 350Z, a 2011 Audi S4 and a 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera (current track car).  I attended Skip Barber 3 day and 2 day advanced racing schools, and raced NASA 944spec.  I've also raced karts and done a bit of autocross and rally cross.  None of this means I'm some great driver, just that I have a fair bit of experience.    

Sunday, we were at Grattan Raceway, Belding, MI, for a track day.  I couldn't resist so I asked my friend if I could drive his ZL1.  He agreed but wouldn't let me drive it with everything turned off (my normal preference), which I felt was understandable.  He said, ""it's like 90% turned off,"" or something to that effect.  I drove it in manual mode.  [Here's a vid he captured from the on-board vid system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbKVFhnq10).  What I liked about the car (in no particular order):  

* Seats.  The seats are fantastic.  Comfortable and super supportive.  Nearly as supportive as full-on race seats but 10x more comfortable.   
* Power and torque is just seemingly endless.  Very addictive.
* Handling was very good.  Fairly predictable behavior, but just not what I would call perfect.  Although I don't know how much the nannies were interfering with it.    
* Steering feel is very good for a car as heavy as this.  A bit over-boosted but still has good feel.  
* HUD is so cool.  All cars should have a HUD.  

Not so great:  

* Weight.  It drives amazing well, but you can feel that weight in the corners.  
* Throttle.  This is the thing that really detracted from the whole experience.  I could not get a feel for the throttle.  It was the most non-linear throttle I've ever experienced in a sports car.  I'd apply 50% and the response was more like 30%.  Then 60% would be 40%.  And then 70% would be 70%.   Really kind of frustrating.  Maybe it was the nannies, or the transmission or something.  

TL;DR:  Fast.  Very fast.  But the throttle needs work.  

EDIT:  It's been mentioned that the electronic aids probably used a weird (IMO) throttle mapping.  That certainly makes sense.  Maybe that's how ""normal"" people like it?  I don't know.  But it wasn't anything I would personally enjoy at any time, street or track.  "	cars

I do this because I don't want something coming up later and being used against me, and I feel it's the right thing to do.  

I find this is not a very effective strategy at getting the price I think is fair.  Although I think it should establish credibility, it tends to just create a point of leverage for buyers to use against my asking price.  Nobody I have ever met discloses like I do.

Im not sure if this the right place for this but here goes.

So last sunday morning my beloved ""Pappa-tunturi"" which is a very classic 52 year old moped here in Finland was stolen and there was a witness to the theft. Now the thief was startled by the feller who saw him and he speeded away in his car with my moped halfway stuffed in. The dude who saw them said that it looked like a two colored Mercedes or a bit older American car. What i know for sure is that it is a sedan and what the backseat looks like as the thief didn't have enough time to pack it in.So im hoping that you automotive enthusiasts could help me identify the car and help me catch the bastard who stole the apple of my eye.

2203	Passed my theory test 1st try. Here’s some last minute tips for anyone taking theirs (UK)	"So I passed my theory test first try after going in with a small level of confidence. Here’s some tips:

1. I strongly recommend the £5 app. That’s all I used as revision and as long as you’ve completed every question on the mock tests, you’re pretty much guaranteed a pass on the multiple choice question. My actual test was literally so similar to a mock on the app I couldn’t help smile to myself after the first few questions.

2. When people say most of it is common sense, it genuinely is. Loads of the questions aren’t strictly to do with driving or are so obviously stupid scenarios that it’s clear what the answer would be. I think where people go wrong is differentiating between what you actually WOULD do and what the law and the DVSA think you SHOULD do. 
 
Here’s an example: 
When can you sound your horn?
1. For fun
2. After midnight
3. To warn someone of danger
4. To let somebody know you’re waiting outside

At first glance you might choose 4 because that’s ‘what you do’ when you arrive at someone’s house, but if you think for an extra second it’s obviously to warn someone of a danger. 

3. Actually reading the question helps because there’s a few ones designed to slip you up like when they slip ‘wouldn’t’ or ‘must not’ rather than would or must in the question.

4. Chill. You have an hour to answer questions that give you the answer. Take your time.

5. Hazard perception. It’s all CGI and extremely slow compared to the real life practise clips. You’ll spot the hazards so easily, just make sure when you spot it and click, you click again a second later to make sure you get some points. Loads of people worry you can’t click loads.

2207	Anyone have experience with having a college or high school autos program fix your car?	"I bought my car last February and I had it in my head that I'd lovingly restore it, but I just don't really have the time or desire to do all of the work myself, and I don't have the money to pay someone else to fix it. I need to store my car this winter so that it doesn't rust, but it really needs a lot of work done to it before I can drive it 2 hours to the cheap storage space I picked out. 

So, does anybody have experience with having your car worked on by students in an automotive program at a local high school or college? Off the top of my head I know that 2 high schools and 2 colleges in the area do automotive work, so I have quite a few choices as far as getting cars worked on. 

The car I'm putting in storage for sure needs a new water pump, transmission seals, weatherstripping, a lot of electrical work, and probably a whole bunch of other gaskets and seals replaced too. Would the students do good work? Would I be completely screwed if they end up breaking something else on the car? I also have another car that needs new brake lines and has been sitting for four years that I would like to send to the school to work on if they do good work. So have you had your car worked on at a school by students, and if so, what was your experience? Your advice would be greatly appreciated! "	cars

2212	The Reality of Owning an Old German Super Sedan (My E55 Story)	" 

Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit! I've been lurking for a long time but finally decided to post something.

**Warning:** This is long, but I want to share as much as I can for someone looking to get into this stuff.

So we've all heard the stories on old German luxury cars. Some say they're the best things since sliced bread due to the depreciation (Tavarish), others say to avoid them like the plague (Scotty Kilmer). Personally, I think they're all right to a degree, since these cars vary so wildly in condition. If you find the right one, it can be awesome and rewarding. Get an example with 13 previous owners and a sketchy VIN history report, then yeah, you're *probably* going to have a bad time.

Around 14 months ago, I made the decision to plunge head first into the world of out-of-warranty German cruise missiles. The lease was ending on my Focus, and I had always lusted over the idea of going fast while getting my butt massaged for cheap. In retrospect, I had no business even thinking about getting an older car with high maintenance costs; the most I had ever done on a vehicle was change the oil. This was also going to be my **only** car. But I thought ""hey, all these people on the Internets are doing it, why cant I?"" So the search began.

I eventually settled on a 2003-2006 W211 chassis Mercedes E55 AMG. I chose this for a few reasons. 1) there is a *massive*community online for these things, and pretty much every problem has already been solved and documented on a forum. 2) this was one of the last ""easy"" AMG's to work on, as not many special tools are needed and most maintenance items are accessible without much hassle. And the biggest one, 3) these engines and drivetrains are known for being extremely reliable (my **only** car, remember?). There's a famous video of a 400k mile original engine E55 putting down similar power numbers to factory spec on a dyno. For really any car with that mileage, that's impressive. Oh yeah and it also had 469hp and 516 ft/lbs of torque bone stock. I was sold.

I found a fantastic example, a 2004 1-owner car with just under 100k miles. The only problem was... it was on the opposite side of the country. The car was in Seattle, I'm in Detroit. I had only ever bought one car in my life (the Focus at age 18) and had literally no idea what to do, but it looked *so damn good.* So naturally, I went to [Internet.com](https://internet.com/) and figured out what to do for buying a car site unseen. I had the dealer drive the car to a nearby Mercedes shop to have a PPI done. This is **absolutely critical** with these high-end luxury cars. You might visually see nothing wrong and have no CEL's, but there can be a whole lot wrong under the surface once the dealer-specific computers are plugged in. Everything checked out good, and once financing was set up (yes I'm young and dumb and financed an old site-unseen German car) I was ready to go.

A booked flight later and some hotels reserved (shout-out to those hotel rewards points) and I was in Seattle with my new baby. If you ever have the chance to do a cross-country road trip, **do it.** It was spectacular, especially while going through the mountains at \*insert expensive ticket here\* speeds. 2500 miles and 1 week later and I was home without the car missing a beat.

But anyways, getting to answering the question of why you're here: how much does it really cost to daily drive one of these things? Answer: **It's complicated.** Let me explain.

If you're going to directly compare this to the running costs of a similar year and mileage Corolla, it's no question; the AMG (or whatever you get) is going to be much more expensive. Go ahead, make Scotty Kilmer's day and buy the more reasonable car. There's nothing wrong with that! What Scotty won't tell you, though, is that these old super sedans *are a fucking blast.* Nothing puts a smile on your face like a ridiculously overpowered 4 door sleeper, especially when you start to realize there's not much on the road that's faster than you. Okay fine, maybe taking corners in an old Miata is more fun, but here in Michigan we don't have those things called ""corners.""

Being a person who had never really done much car maintenance/repairs before this, the E55 has been surprisingly enjoyable to work on. If you have some basic tools and a jack/jack stands, you can do most of the stuff yourself. These cars aren't that much different than anything else, and have enough room to get your hands where they need to be (unlike many modern engine bays). Parts aren't that expensive, as long as you don't pay the Mercedes tax. You can avoid this by using [www.fcpeuro.com](https://www.fcpeuro.com/) , as you can get OEM parts for a fraction of the dealer cost. The warranty is cool too. [www.mbworld.org](https://www.mbworld.org/) has lots of useful DIY's and other information, along with many other M-B specific forums. If you understand basic mechanics, you'll be fine. This car has essentially forced me to learn how to fix a car myself, as 1) it's my only car and 2) if I went to the dealership for every repair I would be living in a tent in a Detroit alley. My car would be cool though!

So onto the juicy numbers. In my exactly 1 year of ownership, I have put 27k miles on the car. My overall average MPG (60% highway 40% city) is about 17.5mpg on premium. I have been stranded 0 times (knock on lacquered interior wood trim).

And the fun stuff, the maintenance items. This is what I've done off the top of my head. Everything was done in my garage with basic hand tools and a jack with jack stands, other than the engine rear main seal since the whole trans had to be dropped.

* both motor mounts
* transmission mount
* valve cover gaskets
* breather cover RTV gaskets
* oil cooler housing seals
* heater control valve
* all brake pads and rotors (they're massive on this car, 8 piston front, 4 piston back, made by Brembo)
* crankshaft position sensor
* thrust arms (front control arms)
* lower ball joints
* outer tie rods
* stabilizer bar links
* spark plugs (takes 16!)
* intercooler water pump
* supercharger pulley belt
* alarm siren
* front wheel bearings and hubs
* alternator
* about 5 oil changes (every 5k miles)
* I also purchased an advanced MB-specific scan tool for \~$150 that allows me to read some dealer-level codes and do intermediate diagnostics.

In total, I have probably spent around $3k in maintenance on this car in my 1 year of ownership, and Lord knows how much in gas. The E55 runs great now and feels like it hasn't lost any of its 469 ponies.

Would I do it all again? *Hell yes.* I know, I know, it costs a lot to maintain and register and whatever, but this is one of those cars you can't imagine giving up. Could it just be an emotional attachment of some kind? Sure, but you forget about that every time you put your foot down. It's no Hellcat, but it's fun making Mustang owners mad when they get gapped by a 14 year old car with a mountain bike on the roof.

**TL;DR**, to conclude my ridiculously long first ever post, if you're looking to buy an old German super sedan, follow these steps:

1. Do your homework
2. Get a PPI from a dealer
3. Don't jump on the first car you see
4. Realize it's not a Corolla
5. Always keep an ""emergency fund"" for when that one expensive thing breaks
6. Wave goodbye to the Challenger SRT while your butt is being massaged... *in style*

I'm a little concerned because I noticed this last week right before my alternator died, and I just had it replaced Friday.

2215	Simple truck upgrades	I recently purchased a 2009 Dodge Dakota with the 4.7 V8. I'm very excited to have a truck again.

Are these still effective  and are there other  basic upgrades to a stock truck that i can/should do? 	cars
2216	Trying to Crack the Code: More Power for the Mazda Skyactive Engines?	"I’ve read a ton of times people saying that if someone wants the Sky G 2.0 to make big-time horsepower, they’re insane. To an extent, they’re right. But, humor me just a bit in my speculation. 

The Sky-G has a weak rotating assembly and open deck block. The head and piston design has an ultra-high compression ratio and a piston cavity that was created to optimize efficiency, not horsepower. The designed focused on torque with an undersquare long stroke. Efforts to increase power result in knock and the computer cuts back on ignition timing. The Sky-G is also extremely sensitive to high temps, and there is a report of a piston exploding and taking out the two adjacent cylinders. The engine also does some weird stuff like keeping the intake valves open after the piston starts the exhaust stroke in order to “fool” the engine into thinking it has a lower compression ratio. 

So my question is, if we were able to “deactivate” the Skyactive engines, essentially turning them into square (or oversquare) 4-strokes, could they handle more power? What parts would be required to do so? How cost effective (if at all) would it be? 

This is all merely speculation, but I’d like to hear other’s thoughts and ideas on this matter. "	cars

So I recently got new tires on my '11 Mazdaspeed3 from Discount Tires. I had ordered some Hankook Ventus V2 concept tires that had solid reviews, but when I showed up they said they don't have them and can't get them but will ""upgrade"" me to [Barum Bravuris](https://www.discounttiredirect.com/buy-tires/barum-bravuris-3hm/p/11423) tires instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had already paid and needed tires, so I just said okay and let them do it. I drove the tires on some mountain roads and they are okay. Better than my worn out Yokohamas, but just okay. The manager ended up calling me and saying he was very sorry, etc. and that I can swap the tires out for anything if I don't like them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't driven too many tires, so I'm not sure if I should go and try to swap. Most of the decent tires I read about are also double the cost of thes Barum's, and I dont want to be a dick and ask for super expensive tires to replace these.

Just wondering if anyone has experience with these tires compared to others, or just an opinion on what you'd do in my position.

Personally I would love to do a build. My example would be the Alfa Romeo 159 wagon, but put in an engine that matches the looks and add a suspension lift system so it can look pretty in the parking lot or on smooth roads, but be driveable and not scraping everywhere when dailying. When I estimate costs for that though, I realise I can buy something that's better, newer, etc. and the idea dies.

2245	Why does Cadillac still fall behind MB, Audi, and BMW in the large luxury section	"If you look up the new cadillac CTS coupe, either a render or concept that unfortunately was never brought to light, you can see a serious competitor to the BMW 6 and the MB SL. In my opinion its gorgeous. 

The CT6 sedan, proposed by Cadillac to be the S-Class killer, is compared to the likes of the A6, 5 series, and E class in most motoring magazines, but not the A8, 7 series or S class. 

Ill see far more Q7's, GL's, and X5's than I would an Escalade in the wealthier parts of NJ. 

We have the Audi Prologue and E-tron, the Mercedes Maybach 6, IAA, AMG GT, and BMW's 8 series gran coupe and X7. All beautiful with obvious design elements either currently placed into their regular production cars or definitely into their future lineup. Cadillac has produced some of the most extravagant and yacht-like concepts as well, the Cadillac Escala, Elmiraj, and Ciel, all cars you'd imagine could be fighting Rolls Royce, Bentley, and Maybach. 

They know what beauty is, yet they fail with cars like the CT6 and CTS, so much anticipation of ""Finally, a Cadillac model that will bring that name back to glory"" when you saw the concept of the model, yet when put into production you walk past it and its still a bland, chunky looking Cadillac. And when compared to the A6 and A8, E and S class, 5 and 7 series, the germans can still produce a car that's crisp and stunning. 

Cadillac sells less than half the volume of its competitors. I see ugly XT5s obviously built on the chevy equinox platform, fat XTS's, small unattractive base model ATS's, no CTS or CTS-V's, no CT6. Why is it that Cadillac underperforms, are they not capable, restricted by GM, underfunded or ill-equipped? Does their design department not care about their production cars as much as the concepts, or are they maybe two completely separated departments? 

They were once the car to envy and be sought after, something to work hard for. It's disappointing to see its concepts never come to fruition, especially when the word Cadillac now brings you the image of an 2001 deville in beat up, stained and dented instead of a pristine 1980's coupe deville in black rolling down the road glimmering with fresh wax and chrome.

On this wonderful 89 degree Michigan Summer day, I decided it was the perfect day to not only sweat out all of my fears and potentially die of dehydration, but also to solve a glaring issue that my cheap tow truck was suffering from.

It can't tow.

Why? because the trailer hitch is [*dangerously* rotten.](https://imgur.com/wSpbGuf) I can literally put my finger through it in multiple places. So what do we do? Well, my original solution was to order an upgraded Class 3 hitch from the likes of Uhaul, Curt, or Hidden Hitch. After reviewing the options and finding that all of them were hideously expensive ($150-$200) and none of them would go in place of the disgusting factory hitch that had experienced weight reduction by rust, I decided I wanted a factory hitch from a Mountaineer or a V8 Explorer. 

OFF TO THE DEALER I GO! 

After a brief (and I mean *brief*) visit to a local Ford Dealership on the east side of Detroit, I found 2 things. 1) good luck finding a new one, and 2) its likely going to be over $300 to find a new old stock factory Class 3 hitch. Fat chance; there is no way I am spending over 1/3rd of the cost of the vehicle on a trailer hitch so I can tow something behind this truck, explode the transmission, and cry until I feel better... (Homer Simpson voice) mmm expensive tears...

So, what do? WELP! Time to bust out the Home Depot/Husky Mechanics tool set, and make the long trek to 8 Mile road in the D (thats Detroit... We call Detroit ""the D"", I know... its terrible). This isn't a plug, but my favorite junk yard is Parts Galore, they have multiple locations around Detroit Metro but by far the best one is off of 8 Mile and Groesbeck Highway (M-97). It costs $1 to get in, and they have *tons* of vehicles to pick from, they also do a stellar job of updating their inventory right on the website, when I checked they said they had 8 Ford Explorer/Mountaineers between 2002-2007 in the yard, and they were 100% correct, and every one of them was within a city block of each other, which made it extremely easy to locate what I was looking for.

The first hitch I found happened to be just as rotten as the one on my truck, but a quick 180 degree turn and I find another 2002 Ford Explorer with a *mint* and completely rust free Class 3 hitch with 6 prong electrical connector and wiring harness/cover that was complete and undamaged, SCORE. 

Removal was easy...ish. the bolts were 15mm on the junk yard truck, but having no access to pneumatic tools, and forgetting my breaker bar, I was limited to the tools I could bring and whatever I could find in the junkyard. The bolts were *tight*, supremely tight. My 1/2 Inch Husky ratchet just didn't have the leverage to break it free, laying underneath this explorer happened to be a short length of 2.5 inch exhaust pipe, so, [I helped myself to a free breaker bar](https://imgur.com/bi4BOvo).

Within minutes the spectacular class 3 hitch was free from its grave yard mountings, ready for a new lease on life on another rusty piece of junk, a quick scour around the donor vehicle and a I find a window trim that I also needed for my truck.

I approach the Cashier with my prize, dumping it onto the counter and leaving a happy little customization (dent) in the steel that it was made out of. The Cashier looked at my, curious, ""what is that?"" she asked me, curious about what I had just discovered during my archaeological dig.   

""its a tail light bulb"" I said with a stupid grin on my face.

The cashier laughed, knowing I was trying to pull a fast one on her, since tail light bulbs are $2 there. 

""really, what is it?"" she asked. I answered honestly (having already looked at he prices for the parts on their website) ""its a Hitch receiver."" 

""AH! thats $25 with a $6 core, cash or card?"" I happily gave her my credit card, she rang me up and threw in the window trim for free.

Time to install; removal of the rear bumper revealed the severity of the condition, I was actually stunned to find that [this had supported my weight in the past](https://imgur.com/gmazK9Z). It was [*bad*](https://imgur.com/O7m5GHO). Welp! out with the old and [in with the new](https://imgur.com/FKPQJC2). 

Even before the bumper was fitted the hitch looked 1000 times better, no pictured here I did happen to undercoat the new hitch, everywhere but the exposed areas, I wanted it to look stock still but be protected from the elements, and [here it is all done!](https://imgur.com/C2gU9Xu)

After this whole ordeal I had 2 hours of my time and $25 of cash invested into the upgrade, and now I have a truck that is capable of towing at its full capacity (5000 pounds) rather than the 0 pounds that the dangerous factory hitch was offering, I was impressed to even find that the factory wiring was compatible with the upgraded hitch and 6 plug RV connector which supports electric brakes that are built into the trailer. Definite win for the day, and the holiday weekend, the next big fix for this truck before winter hits is getting the 4 wheel drive working again, with a surprisingly inexpensive fix.

Until next time! 


**TL;DR - I bought a replacement hitch for my Explorer, it was $25, stop being lazy and read the rest.** "	cars
2256	What do you guys normally use to lift your cars for maintenance??	Hi guys, been trying to do more self maintenance on my cars lately. Usually use a pair of ramps to lift it up for oil changes, but don't really enjoying using those too much. What do you guys normally use to lift the car? Specially for tire rotations?

2257	"2001 Toyota Camry: change in ""feel"" of car after towing trailer across country"	"I bought a 2001 Toyota Camry in very good condition with 115,000 miles with the hopes of getting it to 200,000 miles. 

I moved from Texas to NY a couple months ago, pulling about 1,000 lbs. The transmission fluid did not need to be flushed at that time, but I was advised to flush it after the move. This is a high priority for me, as maintenance is vital if I want to get my baby to 200,000, but I'm struggling with finances after the expensive move and have been putting other financial priorities ahead of it.

The last few weeks, I can feel something different. The car's engine purr/hum/vibration/steady noise/whatever you call it, seems less smooth. No jitters, but... When driving or idling, it feels slightly rougher, and I have a feeling in my gut that there's something wrong with my car.

Is this a sign of the transmission fluid needing to be flushed? Or something else? Can I put it off a couple more weeks, or do I need to take care of it right now?"	cars

2261	Help Identifying Cars in Home Vandalism	"Hey, r/cars!

I am in desperate need of help trying to identify the make/model/year of 2 vehicles that were recently involved in a vandalism of my property. I would rather not focus on that side of the story but rather work towards identifying the vehicles.

I luckily caught everything on security camera so have a pretty general idea about the cars they were driving.

Vehicle #1: This appears to be a Honda Civic, or something similar. We noticed in the video at night that the sedan had very distinctive rims, and caught a glimpse of (what appears to be) the same car driving around at 7am, just 3 hours after the incident. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/ipxB8YA

Vehicle #2: I had more trouble identifying this vehicle. It appears to be some type of Chevy or Ford, but small details on the car will convince me that a certain models aren't the one.

I have provided a Dropbox link containing all of the screenshots AND snippets of the recordings of the vehicles.

Thank you guys for your help, good luck!

2263	Just saw first Alfa Romeo Stelvio, why did it have black smoke coming from the exhaust?	"I was walking my dog and a Stelvio rolls by, this is a flat section of the neighborhood and they were going 25 mph (40 Kph) at most so not giving any throttle really. As it went by I noticed black smoke coming from the exhaust, worse than I see when cars from the 70s go by, and nearly as bad as a two-stroke! I wonder if there was a misfire or something, I thought the engine sounded strange, but at such low speed I could hardly hear the engine idling down the road. This isn't just water vapor, as it was a sunny 90F (32C) day at the time. 

How can such a new vehicle, with such strict modern environmental regulations, smoke that bad? Is it supposed to do this? I have a hard time understanding why VW got so much attention when this gasoline Alfa smokes worse than any VW diesel I've ever seen. If it is intentionally designed I am not sure how it can pass any emissions testing. Or is the FCA build quality that bad that a two-year-old max luxury vehicle could have engine troubles so soon into ownership?"	cars

2269	I seriously need some help eliminating rattles in my exhaust. 2017 Subaru WRX	Before I post this, I have already submitted a post to /r/WRX for help and they gave me virtually no advice so I'm coming here to /r/cars since this isn't a WRX specific issue. Just over half a year ago, I got a catless jpipe installed which came with a mid pipe and had the rest custom fabricated. Bolts that held the midpipe and rest of the exhaust together rattled out so I had all the sound coming out from beneath the car. I ordered a new flat flange, screwed some locknuts onto the new bolts to ensure they didn't rattle out again and figured that was it. Well, something is still rattling. It only happens when I'm accelerating. Not at neutral and not revving it at neutral. It rattles during decel as well. I want to say the flat flange in between the two pipes is what's rattling but it was perfectly flush and I used a torque wrench to bolt the pipes together until I couldn't turn it anymore. Those pipes are bolted together extremely tightly but something is still rattling. Given that it only rattles when I drive, I can't really pinpoint what's rattling. It's kind of hard to investigate a strange sound from the undercarriage when the vehicle is moving. Anyone have any idea what might be causing the rattle? It doesn't sound or smell like there's an exhaust leak and I haven't gotten any CEL or anything like that so I'm beyond confused. 	cars

2273	Of the sedans of the 2000s, which would have looked better / equally as good in coupe form?	"Having seen an [Infiniti G37 Coupe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg/180px-2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg) the other week, this had me thinking about which sedans [that didn't offer a coupe option] would have looked just as good, or better in coupe form.

For me, I'd have probably liked to have seen a coupe version of:

**Hyundai Sonata NF (2004-2009)** [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/06-08_Hyundai_Sonata.jpg). If it was a coupe, I expect Hyundai would have sold it only with the 3.3-liter/237hp V6, and only in CDX [ (later CDX+ trim level ], or for the U.S. and Canada, Limited spec. The 2004-2010 Sonata looked good for a mid-size sedan.

**Mazda 6 (2007-2012)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg/420px-Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg). OK, so there hasn't been a 626 Coupe for years, but the Mazda 6's fluid lines would adapt well to a coupe model. If there was a coupe model, it would probably have been available in Touring and Grand Touring spec, with the 3.7-liter/272hp V6 petrol.

**Ford Falcon BA (2002-2005)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg/300px-2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg). This one is one of my favorite generations of this classic Australian sedan. If there was a coupe, I expect it'd have a choice of three versions - XR6 with the 4.0-liter/244hp 6-cylinder, XR6 Turbo with the 4.0-liter/320hp 6-cylinder turbo and XR8 with the 5.0-liter/350hp V8 Boss 260 engine.

Although, saying that, I actually got my wish to have this version, in a way, as [Australian company Dreamtech built one](https://www.qt.com.au/news/the-coupe-ford-never-built/707321/) with the 5.4-liter/350hp V8 Boss 350 engine and a supercharger. It looks so awesome, I like this one.

**Subaru Legacy BL/BP (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg/1920px-Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg). I already like this sedan and stationwagon anyway, but imagine there being a 2.0-liter/279hp twin-scroll turbo model in GT Spec B version as a sporty coupe. I know there was the Impreza STi in coupe form, but this... it could have been pretty good!

**Audi A8 D3 (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg/420px-2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg). I've always liked the A8, one of the most stately and impressive full-size sedans.

If there was a coupe, I expect it'd be a quattro model with a choice of the 4.2-liter/335hp V8 [ (later the 4.2-liter/345hp V8) ] and the 5.2-liter/444hp V10 FSI engines for the S8 model.

There actually *was* an Audi A8 coupe, [as this article from motorauthority.com shows](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1111462_meet-the-audi-a8-coupe-you-didnt-know-existed), but that was based on the first-generation D2 model, and was from 21 years ago.

Imagine the Audi S8 as a trackday coupe - good idea or bad idea?

2290	How to bluff convincingly about virtually any car	"I'm interested in the ""bluffer's line"" for your car: essentially, something that only people who have owned the car for many years, or pushed it frequently to its limits, or hung around for too long in its subcultures, would know about.

I'll start with my mini-stable:

CLS63 AMG (W218): It really needs the limited-slip diff and it is baffling why AMG did not make this standard equipment. It was only available as an option in the ""S"" version, and Merc will not retroactively fit one to standard 63s. Quaife offer an aftermarket diff that is highly rated in the community.

TVR Cerbera: If the handbrake is too weak, seven times out of ten, it's because you're too weak. The [bizarre layout of the cabin](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2000-TVR-Cerbera-Pictures-c10970?picturesTabFilter=INTERIOR) means that the handbrake is almost at shoulder level, and very difficult to get a good pull on.

2291	Analyst/Nerd Appeal to EV Owners	"This is not any kind of EVangelist promotion. I own a first-generation EV without the capability I am about to mention. (I also own a gas-powered SUV and a diesel truck.) The tl;dr version is that I'm looking for someone with a newer-generation EV who also has a meter at his 240v plug, so we can determine how much electricity is lost when the car is being charged.

**The long version**

The newer EVs have screens that, among other things, will tell you how much electricity you used to go X distance. They will give you fuel economy numbers, typically expressed in miles/kWh and sometimes in equivalent miles per gallon, a/k/a mpg-e.

The problem with these displays is that they omit the considerable EV charging losses. I have seen charging loss estimates ranging from 15% to 25%. So, when I'm doing various analyses, I will use 20% as the charging loss number, but I'm not confident of it. The only way to really know would be to spend \~$100 on an EKM Metering meter, placed right smack next to your 240v plug. This would tell you how much juice you used between charges. Compare that to what your in-car display says, and *voila!* you would have the charging loss. Oh, and you'd have the actu*al electricity use, which you can use to find your EV'*s true fuel economy.

I like my little 2011 Think City battery operated grocery getter, but I regard it as a car and not a cause. And it lacks an onboard fuel economy readout. If I want to know its true electricity consumption and fuel economy (and I do!), then I *must* have a meter next to the plug. I always want the real numbers, and always tell everyone else the good, the bad, and the ugly. So: Are there any EV owners here who measure their car's consumption at the plug with a meter? (Incidentally, this is how the EPA does it when calculating EV fuel economy.) If so, I am *very interested* in working with you to determine the charging loss.

Thanks much. Apologies in advance to those for whom this is pathetically OCD. Hey, folks, once an analyst always an analyst. It's what we are."	cars

2298	Does anyone elses enjoyment of driving get diminished by having to commute to and from work through heavy traffic everyday?	"When I bought my Celica about a year ago I worked at a local company which I could easily reach by public transport and I didnt have to rely on my car. Back then I had immense fun driving since I could chose when and where to drive on my own terms. Most of my kilometers on the odometer back then were from nightly joyrides on the Autobahn or through curvy backroads with no other cars in sight, just me and my machine.

About two months ago I had to switch jobs and got a new job in a different town about 40 kilometers from where I live which is difficult to reach by public transport, so for the first time I had to rely on my car to get me to and from work every day. To make matters worse there is currently a ton of roadwork on the Autobahn which I have to use every day, which means at least one of three lanes is blocked, so most of my time is spent creeping at 30 kph behind trucks. I need about an hour for those 40 km, which should tell you about the speed I can go at.

This all but has completely killed my enjoyment of driving. Instead of sitting down behind the wheel with a smile on my face as I turn on my car I loathe having to take that commute everyday. Not to mention having to pay super close attention to fuel economy and probably having my rates raise up from increased km/year.

Maybe this is just a whiny rant, but does anyone else feel that way? Right now I feel like I'd rather go back to public transport, even if it would take me longer than being stuck in traffic.

2299	Girlfriend Lost Control and Wrecked ‘13 TSX Trying to Avoid a Deer. Totaled??	"Driving my car down the parkway to get to work around 7:00 this morning my girlfriend had a deer run out in front of her. She tried swerving to avoid it, looks like she couldn’t stop the understeer and went full General Lee flying over a roughly 10’ grass ramp acting as the median right into the other side of traffic. Thankfully it was early and there was no oncoming traffic but she got a lot of air and came down hard. Steering wheel and passengers side curtain airbags deployed. She’s okay albeit pretty bruised and will be sore for a while, definitely the best possible outcome safety wise. (Picture below of the sick Acura logo brand she got when the airbag deployed) 

[Acura Brand As Promised](http://cubeupload.com/im/Hubersglutes/1C81EF4D2D4E44628A6A.jpeg) 

I haven’t been able to look at the car yet as the tow yard is closed for Labor Day but have seen the pics she sent me. Will go on Tuesday with the appraiser. Front and rear bumpers both damaged, rear drivers side tire blew, bent rim, maybe brake damage. Several scuffs and scrapes around the entire vehicle. Since I haven’t gotten to see it I’m assuming the worst so far as the suspension etc. 

Cars worth around 12K. My research is saying the airbags alone could be almost half of that. I think KY requires 75% of value in damages to total a vehicle. I’m thinking it’ll be totaled. What do you guys think? 

Also side note: I never realized how little I could care about damage to the car just knowing she’s safe. Like holy shit this could’ve been sooo much worse.

2302	Are my 5 year old tires due for a change? - 06 Acura TL	"I have an 06 Acura TL - Automatic. Currently running Yokohama 580 for all 4 tires, 6/32 (front) and 9/32 (rear). The tires are however 5 years old and show some cracking on the inside but I am unsure if there's any issues/cracking at the side wall.
Here are some pics
https://imgur.com/a/WyIoq2F

I believe the previous owner of the car put ~5000 miles on them and I put maybe ~10000 or less over 18 months (I ran chinese Milestar tires in the winter but then blew a sidewall in a giant pot hole)

I realize the tires are old and I do plan on replacing them especially before the winter comes (I live in the midwest). I'd prefer to go with name brand all season tires and ~$400-$500 installed if possible. I drive 5000-10000/year or less (mostly highway 55-75 mph)

My local discount tire has some cheap no name brand tires on their website which I don't trust but when I went to the physical store they tried to sell me some $700 continentals. Since I don't drive much ( I may drive less than 5000 miles on certain years if I end up relocating ) what are some good options for me? Rebates, etc. Should I replace only the front tires since the rear still have plenty of tread?

Are all 235/45/17 tires created equal (will they all fit properly)"	cars

2306	2018 Chevrolet Malibu Premier Review: Better than an Audi?	"So a few days ago, I was really bored, and after reading a bunch of media reviews of the new Chevrolet Malibu, I decided to go check one out. I was at my local ford dealer getting an oil change, and well, I decided to pop over next door to see what the Chevrolet dealer had, and after chatting a bit with the salesman, and saying that I want something ""sportier but 4 door"", the guy pulled up a loaded Malibu and told me to get in.

So the car I'm talking about is loaded, with a canada exclusive ""Premier True North Edition"", with all the driver assistance tech and 19 inch wheels. Sticker price was $37 thousand (CAD) and change, but after factory incentives and adding AC tax and destination the car was around 34 thousand and change (building an identical car on the chevy website got me $34,700)

So the Malibu I sat in was black exterior, black interior, and black bowtie, essentially everything that could be black was black. The premier trim gets you LED DRLs, and LED tail lights. I hate black cars, but putting that aside, I have to say, the Malibu is a bit of a butterface. The front isn't great, but the side profile and rear is pretty handsome, and the sloping, coupe like roofline does look pretty good. But the front, ugh, the split grille isn't to my liking, and even in the top trim, the non-drl lights are still halogen and not LED, kinda disappointing for a loaded car in 2018 (especially since the tail is full LED).

On the inside, the black interior color probably hides a lot of the cheaper materials used, but it looks totally fine. The seats could be a little bit softer, and there's some weird wood trim on the door and around the shifter, but the materials used is mostly OK. The mirrors auto dim, and are heated, but unfortunately, the rear view mirrors don't fold electronically I believe. The steering wheel feels nice and meaty, but I don't particularly like the membrane buttons. The air vents are angled weirdly, but you can still get the air to blow at your face. Heated and vented front seats complete the package, and were much appreciated during the test drive. 

The infotainment is nice, smooth, and fast. The screen is pretty bright, and from my experience with a few FM stations, the audio is more than competent. You get 4G LTE, alongside carplay and android auto, there's also a wireless charging pad that I really like. 

On the road, the Malibu is surprisingly good. The chassis is brilliant, as the car really handles like it is a few hundred pounds lighter than you expect (apparently, depending on config, the Malibu starts at 3,084, which is much lighter than the competition). The suspension is a weakpoint, as it does mildly dive a bit when you push it and there is a bit of body roll. The salesman did mention that Chevy offers a factory upgraded suspension, which according to the website actually lowers your car (aside: factory slammed Malibus are a thing now?). Steering is acceptable, the ratio is quick enough, and the power steering is boosted to an acceptable, but not overboosted level. There is some torque steer if you floor the car, but not really if you're really gentle with the throttle. 

The drivetrain is above average for its class for sure. The GM turbo 4 is a very good engine, torque hits you like a wall. Lag is a bit more noticable than ford Ecoboosts, but I have a feeling it would be better on premium gas. The engine is for the most part quiet, no perceivable engine vibration could be felt in the seats and the broad torque curve was pretty damned nice for day to day driving. Transmission wise, the transmission for the most part shifts smooth, but the new 9 speed could use a bit of tuning maybe, on low speed city roads it hunts for gears occasionally. 

Overall, the Malibu is more than OK, and for 34 thousand ish canadian bucks. As a comfortable, daily, family sedan, Malibus are a good option despite some of my nitpicks (Halogen headlights, bad front end design, odd interior design). 

Is it better than an Audi though? Hmm, well, I think its better than the Fusion, Altima, Mazda 6, and Camry for sure. Maybe the Accord is better? hard to say without more driving. But price for price, I'd 100% take the Malibu before I take the similarly priced FWD A3, and I'd prefer the malibu even to the FWD a4 that's $5000 more. 

I do feel that GM could potentially have a home run in their hands if they bring back the Malibu SS. Up the power a bit to ~270 hp like in the Camaro, add in Buick's Hi-per-strut, maybe add an AWD system, and Chevrolet might actually have a hit on their hands. The chassis is actually quite good, after all, the Malibu is a midsized that weights like a compact, its even ~400lbs lighter than a FWD A4 while being a whole size class up!

I mentioned in a thread a couple days ago that the 1st gen Neon is a car that I've always had a soft spot for on top of my already strong attraction to old econoboxes. So I bought this at an auction a few hours ago for $225. It has only 68,000 miles and I'm only the 2nd owner. The previous one donated it about a month ago. I'm sure you're curious why. Everything works....except for the shift linkage. Gonna replace that and use this as one of my beaters.

2324	Questioning my ability to drive my car these days (RPM hang).	"I won't lie, I'm a bit reluctant to post this due to how judgmental most people tend to be...We'll see how this goes.

​

As the title states, I'm starting to question my ability to drive my car. This could possibly entirely all in my head. I drive a 2018 WRX MT (duh). As a lot of manual drivers know, modern cars have RPM hang. I generally shift around 3k RPM because I don't see a reason to drive faster. However, if I shift from say 2 to 3rd (or 3 to 4, 4th to 5th is VERY noticable), I can tell I'm generally shifting too fast as my RPMs drop when I release the clutch. It's not a jerky feeling, it's actually REALLY smooth. It's just that 600-800RPM difference I assume is putting stress on the flywheel as the speed of the engine and road are differential? On the flipside, if I wait a bit...the RPMs jump up a bit (200-400 RPM) because I'm waiting too long. I release the clutch slowly and don't dump it.

I know most younger drivers can careless about improving their ability, but I am not one. I want my car to last and I want to be able to pass on good traits.

I would GREATLY appreciate any input to improve. I've been told to shift at higher RPMs but that just seems to lead to needing to wait more...Thanks"	cars

I didn’t fully turn the key off until I pulled it out.  (now that I think about it could have solved the problem. I used to ride a motorcycle so I assumed it would just turn right back on.)

I own a 96 Dodge Dakota.  Perfect condition, runs great, I love my little truck.  Since buying the truck both doors, driver and passenger have broken in the same way and I'm curious if anyone knows a solution to this problem or has encountered it before.

On both doors, the bottom hinge of the door has broken completely through the frame of the door.  When you close the door, the hinge doesn't rotate anymore it literally just pushes itself -into- the frame of the door where it has broken a hole around it.  

On the drivers door I tried to have a mechanic weld it, and he did a shit job and burned a hole through the door and turned the hinge into slag.  That one I've resigned myself to simply replacing the entire door with one from a salvage yard (If I can ever find one).  

The Passenger side door is only slightly damage at this time and I'm curious if anyone has ever encountered this type of failure before that might have some solutions on how to fix it?  Or how to prevent it from happening again when I get a new door to install.  "	cars

2353	Is the 2011 Nissan Juke transmission failing?	"My dad got a 2011 Nissan Juke when it came out because it was ""the first of its kind"" and it was just the perfect fit for his budget (my parents also liked the looks wuuuuut). It has about 118k mi.

Anyway, I have been driving this car for college and I've noticed a few things weird with the car. For one, it vibrates when I go over 63~ mph, and the vibration gets stronger the faster I go. Like, my body goes up and down, the steering wheel sorta shakes, etc. 

Second, it takes a little too long to switch gears, and when it does, it gives off a tiny but noticeable jerk. I wait like 1-2 seconds for the tranny to switch from reverse to drive, etc. 

Third, sometimes, the Juke is too slow to accelerate. I'm in stop and go traffic, and sometimes the car  just feels much slower than usual, despite the normal revving noise I'd expect when accelerating in S&amp;G traffic. Could it be because I decided to fill the car with premium once and went back to regular?

Also, the fuel mileage is pretty bad. I got about 22-23 mpg on mixed SG and highway driving. Could it also be because I mixed premium with regular? I don't believe I drive like a maniac, like, I don't accelerate harder than cars around me, and if there are no cars around me, I sometimes let go of the pedal so that I won't have to use the brakes as much.

Is the Juke toast? What is the best way to proceed forward?"	cars

2359	Mustang for Fiesta ST...now I get it	"Hi everyone! After being on the fence about trading in my 2011 Mustang for a semi-hot hatch, I finally took the plunge. 

I was looking at the used market for the Focus ST, MK7 GTI, and Fiesta ST. I looked the idea of the GTI but future maintenance scared me away. The used market for the Focus ST was a little too high and then I found a certified pre-owned Fiesta ST with every option available for under 15k and I took that as a sign from the universe. 

My mustang was only a V6 but it was optioned exactly like I wanted: Premium Leather, performance package and glass roof (pretty rare). It was tough to move on from the Mustang but I needed a little more usable space (no kids but 2 pets). The dealer tried to low ball me on the trade initially for 7k and we eventually got to a number I was comfortable. We ended up on 9.5k plus I would save 500 in taxes; blue book had the Mustang from 10-11k and my car was very clean with be tires and brakes all around. Unfortunately, it had bubbling paint on the hood which the S197 generation is notorious for and they stuck to giving me a little less the excellent trade in value. 

Long story short, the moment I drove the Fiesta ST, I was hooked. It just felt right. The Mustang always felt bigger than it needed to be while the Fiesta ST's proportions felt balanced. I'm not the biggest guy (5'8) and the Recaros hugged me just right. On the highway, I could pass while in 6th gear while the Mustang would struggle in 5th gear and forget about 6th gear. 

The Fiesta felt like the iconic cars from the 90's that I grew up idolizing. Let this be advice for anyone looking to get into a hot hatch: You don't need the biggest or fastest to have fun!"	cars

My last car was a turbo firefly/geo swap and they feel really similar so I'm doubting it. I'm fine with finessing it cause it's reliable and fun to drive but I'm wondering if some transmission additive or something would help and which kind that should be. I'm pretty green with car mechanical stuff, btw. Any info appreciated. 	cars
2365	When I saw a used Civic Type R on craigslist $40k, I decided to shop around...	"I had assumed that enough time had passed and you might be able to get a Type R near retail, or at least find one in stock, so when I saw a used one with a few thousand miles on it for $40k on craigslist, I decided to check out the local dealers. The closest one I found that still had one in stock was asking $58,091. Has anyone seen a Civic Type R for a higher price, or is that the new record? For comparison, I decided to search for similarly priced cars, and here are the local competitors in that price bracket: 


2018 C-Class AMG C43 for $59,000

2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia for $58,835 

2018 Chevy Camaro ZL1 for $55,950

2018 Ford Focus RS for $55,414 (SERIOUSLY STILL???)

2018 Tesla Model 3 Extended Range for $54,900

2018 Chevy Corvette Stingray for $52,688

2018 Dodge Charger SRT 392 for $48,777

2018 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport (400hp) for $45,491

2018 Nissan 370Z Roadster for $47,995

2018 Chevy Camaro 1LE (455hp) for $49,900


Or, you can go buy a new Civic Type R on ebay for $10k-$20k less. 

Edit: fixed 370Z price.

2371	Upgraded my daily driver this week. I’m excited to see what torque feels like!	"After owning a 2017 BRZ for almost two years, I thought it was still the perfect car for me. I modified it for track duty (header, tires, brakes, coils,etc) and it was still totally compliant for daily use. I saw a used ISF go up for sale at a local dealer and I was always curious how they drove. With no intentions to buy one, I took it for a spin and was instantly hooked. It was very comfortable, great handling, and the motor is so smooth and sounds godly when the intake flap opens. This always sat in the back of my mind and I told myself whenever I needed to upsize to 4 doors, the ISF will be my car of choice. 

Well, the time has come where I need more room and I can’t say I’m disappointed! I’ll definitely miss the BRZ since it was so well balanced and very lightweight. It taught me how to drive on the track and never had issues. Although, the ISF is in another level in terms of speed and comfort. I found this 2009 ISF with 80k miles in California and had it shipped over to Arizona as there was not one for sale here in decent shape. No rust, no accidents, and in very good shape. Hopefully I will take this to an HPDE event once or twice over the winter to see its capabilities until I have room for a track dedicated car.

2376	Fixing issues as soon as they appear vs. waiting until they get serious?	"So I recently got into an argument with my mother and her fiancé about how to treat minor issues with a car which could become troublesome later down the line.

I own a 203.000 km Toyota Celica and it is starting to show its age. Recently, the transmission has started whining around certain speeds (around 50-70 kph), indicative of differential pinion gear wear. It might also leak a little bit of oil and the dampers are slowly losing their power, making the ride even less comfortable than it already was. Also the chassis in general is starting to get creaky and I am sure the clutch release bearing is starting to wear down as well, as there is a rattling noise whenever I engine-brake.

Now I showed all those issues to the fiancé of my mother, who has driven everything from tiny subcompacts over big trucks to even a tank in his life and he told me to stop worrying. All those things are simply indicative of an old car and should not concern me yet, it will still run for another 50.000 km at least and until then I will have found a new car.

My mother owns a 198.000 km VW Lupo (a city car with 50 HP for those unaware because I dont think its being sold in murica) and its an absolute shitbox. Whenever I drive it (rarely) I feel like it could fall apart at any moment. The clutch is super fucked, the shifter is the most wobbly thing in the world and the transmission and suspension rattles to hell and back. But my mother doesnt care. She only drives it for about 12 km a day from work and back and to the grocery store every week and it has yet to fail her. 

Both of them tell me to not worry so much about my car and that if I would give in to my worries every time I would probably visit the mechanic every single month, but I just want my car to last as long as possible and feel great driving it. I cant afford to simply send it to a mechanic right now either because I need to to get to work and back (80 km everyday). 

Who is in the right here? Should I worry and try to fix those ""minor"" issues ASAP or should I learn to live with the wear and tear of an old car?"	cars

Literally nearly every car journalist and review has complained about the engine and it's lack of power. I'm sure they are more than well aware that their market wants a more powerful version of the car. Yet Subaru releases the BRZ tS, in which they improved nearly every other performance attribute, except for the engine, which is by far the most complained about, most lacking and underwhelming aspect of the car? They're not dumb. They know that the engine is the worst part about the car. They know that this is what the consumers want. Common business sense would be release a more powerful version of the car. Yet it's been 6 years and they have stubbornly refused to and I can't figure out their reasoning. Why are they doing this?"	cars

Well I was reading more and saw here and there that its recommended to change the drain plug gasket with every or every other oil change.  I've never heard of this.  Should I be doing this?  Also, when looking at my manual for my car it mentions I need to use   oil meeting GM standard GM6094M.  I also didnt know about this.  My vehicle is a 2006 Pontiac Torrent.  Is this an outdated standard and should I be following it?  I looked up on Mobile's website and it says I should use a different oil to meet that standard.  I thought all I needed to look for was 5-W30 oil.  Am I way over-complicating this?  After all, its been getting 12 years of crappy oil at quick lube shops this whole time and all they have only ever mentioned was 5-W30 oil.  What are your thoughts?

Edit:  Should I be using Mobile 1 Extended Performance full synthetic oil since its supposed to be guaranteed for 1 year or 15,000 miles whichever comes first?  This oil is available on a similar deal and is only about $5 more and should theoretically last me a year instead of 6 months with what I have.  That oil does make the GM6094M spec.  I do have an engine oil life indicator on the dash that will light up when its time to change the oil.  Should I just follow that light for when to change the oil again?"	cars

2418	Random thought: People that drive older cars, do you also enjoy this?	"It's no secret that cars have gotten substantially bigger over time. Obviously I guess parking spaces have also adapted to the growth of cars. Personally, I tend to drive older cars. As such, sometimes I'll run into a compact car spot (often times they're situated in a way that you only have one car next to you or none, like there's protective barriers between spaces, so they're quite nice), snugly fit my car in the space, and smile. I just think it's funny how these formally normal-sized cars are the same size as today's ""compacts"" (sometimes smaller).

I guess this doesn't really apply to old American muscle cars though. Watching my dad and his '66 Continental is always amusing. "	cars

A few weeks ago, you guys helped me figure out that my car has a [potential CVT issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/912eqx/went_to_two_mechanics_who_cant_figure_out_whats/). I read on Nissan’s website that they extended their CVT warranty:

In many posts I read about people removing the hose from the BPV (Bypass valve) and then capping the other end with a plug. That end is on the intake. So basically just removing the hose altogether and completely off the BPV. Not sure if I make sense. I assume this hose is here to release excess air to avoid damaging the turbo? It sends it back into the intake. My car doesn’t have a MAF sensor. That I am aware of. It’s a 2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport with the 1.6t motor.  

My question is. Doing this won’t cause any damage? Isn’t the car expecting this air to come right back to it? Doesn’t this in turn affect boost as well?"	cars

2432	I need advice on what you do when a dealership has scammed me.	"I purchased a Dodge Dart 2016 about a week ago from a used car dealership. I did a test drive, everything was fine with the carfax, 2 previous owners. 2nd owner had it for 6 months, which I thought was odd, but people trade in cars all the time. 

Day 1 of having it for a couple of hours, after getting home the car failed to start when I tried to go to the store. I thought that was fine, I'd just notify the dealership and they'll fix it, engine light came on the second day. I went back to the dealership on Saturday for them to fix whatever was wrong with the car, and for them to finish the detail. I was there for 2 hours, and after handing me back my keys, I ask why the engine light came on, and the guy said 'something with the oil,' and that was that. 

I went on a trip with my sisters on Saturday. We just traveled an hour and 20 minutes away to go to an event. Half way through the event I decided to go buy snacks for all of us, but when I got into the car, it wouldn't start again. I tried about 2 more times until it finally started, but the car vibrated really hard and the engine light came back on. 

I made it to Target to get the snacks and when I got back to the car, and started it up, the engine began overheating, the battery light came on and the car died. So sat there for a while, a couple of people asked if I needed a jump, but I didn't accept any help, I didn't think it was the battery and I honestly didn't know what to do when an engine overheats, no car I've never had ever overheated.  I called my mom to come pick us up, since I didn't want to start the car up again, and risk damaging anything. The hood of the car was up the entire time I was sitting at target, the temperature that day was over 100 degrees. About 20 minutes later I went to see if the engine was still over heating after reading a couple or articles about overheating Dodge Dart 16s. 

It took a couple of times to get it to start, it was still overheating, but not as bad, it wasn't going above the red line. I made my way to an AutoZone that was down the street and asked for the engine light check.

I explained my situation to the guy and he told me I should bring the car back. (I already tried, salesman said no) The AutoZone guy, David, said I needed new spark plugs, which is why it isn't starting on the first try. He said that I wouldn't need new spark plugs until about 750000 miles, and I was only at 33000. 

He went ahead and checked to coolant for me after I told him about the overheating, and there was very little coolant in the car, he couldn't even see any. So I went ahead a purchased coolant, and he put it in for me. 

My mom finally made it to us, and we debated leaving the car there to be towed, but ultimately decided against it since the car was no longer overheating.

We made it about 10 minutes from home before the car died again at a red light. I pressed the gas to go, and realized the the cars engine wasn't running. A guy stopped to help us out, and checked to oil. There was no oil. He got us home, and told us to look into the lemon law. I'm in Texas. 

We notified the salesman the next day, and that's when he said that the car can't be returned, and that we have to bring the car to a Dodge dealership, since it's still under warranty. 4 days later Dodge says that the car has been in an obvious wreck and was fixed without it showing up on the carfax. They obviously did a horrible job, and the engine was damaged in the wreck, and possibly not covered under warranty, since the repairs that were done could have contributed to the engine damage. 

I just left the carsalesman and he said his boss is going to talk to the Dodge dealership, because they have to fix it under warranty. 

I do not want the car anymore, I just wanna return it. The salesman lied to me, not only about the obvious wreck damage, but about the mpg the car gets and about it having navigation. 

I'm in Texas, I wanna know my options, thanks for reading. 

Edit: I was at the dealership the day before I went on my trip, and they failed to add oil and coolant to the car. Despite telling me that the engine light was on because of a 'oil problem.'"	cars
2433	A question about tire size for my car (AKA, I goofed and am wondering if its salvageable)	"My oem wheels are 16X6.5
My normal (and officially correct) tire size is 205/55/R16

Bought some snow tires (craigslist) to swap in for winter, and somehow bought 205/65/R16 I don't know how I missed that they are 205/65, but I have them now.

My understanding of the math involved:
205 * .55 = ~112.75mm sidewall height
205 * .65 = ~133.25mm sidewall height

The difference is only 20.5mm, and here my understanding gets fuzzy. Does that mean my overall diameter got 20.5 mm greater, or 41mm greater. And either way, are those too big of increases to use?

The car in question is a 2005 VW beetle.

Aside from putting them on and trying it, is there a way to reasonably figure out if these tires will work for me?

For that matter, if I put them on, and they don't rub while turning sharply, what else can I test to make sure they are fitting ok?"	cars

2439	The Dream Of A New Rotary Sports Car From Mazda Is Still Alive		cars
2440	A new approach to Tesla/Musk/Electric Vehicle threads	"**(TL;dr: Tesla-related submissions and comments are going to be subject to increased scrutiny.)**


Stick with me here, this is going to get a bit ""Pepperidge Farm remembers"" for a minute.

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.** There are a number of bad actors on both sides of the electric vehicle argument and we've found ourselves regularly brigaded by members of both parties. 


On one hand we have anti-EV people who wish only for Tesla to fail and post articles (founded or not) that lambast Tesla and Elon Musk and anything to do with EVs, and on the other we have pro-Tesla folks (including an obstinate contingent of TSLA's own social media interns -- yes, we see you) who do all they can to spin the Tesla talk to positive.


This sort of William Randolph Hearst-esque **yellow journalism in which the headlines make the news is not acceptable here.** As one of the largest online automotive enthusiast forums operative (astonishingly, we're on track to hit 1,000,000 users by the end of the year) we have an obligation to keep our headlines fair and neutral, without giving preference to either contingent. 

Therefore, we've begun implementing some actions to minimize the effects of those acting in bad faith. **Going forward we'll be preemptively removing all EV submissions (and releasing them pending approval)** and taking a stronger stance against those who spam agenda-based posts. We will continue to monitor threads and will, as always, remove comments that are uncivil or encourage uncivil behavior (this means trolling and baiting, for instance). We will more aggressively monitor submissions for newsworthiness; one criterion will be, simply, ""Would this be newsworthy if it were about any other manufacturer?"" 

We will work to make sure that one voice does not dominate the discussion.


In short, we will not allow the Tesla War to be fought in our yard and follow us to our parlor. **This is not the place to promote your agenda;** our users have overwhelmingly indicated that, by and large, they don't want to see r/cars dominated by Tesla/EV/Musk headlines. r/teslamotors and r/realtesla exist and should be used. This isn't to say that we'll not allow any Tesla submissions: If an article passes the sniff test and is actually news, it is a valuable contribution to the subreddit and should be posted. However, we won't allow headlines to write the news and we want to make sure that we continue to have the best automotive community on the Internet.

So, as Abraham Lincoln said at the conclusion of the Civil War: [""Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S67sDHdhpio)

2449	I think I have a problem... I was window shopping for a Corvette and jumped on a unicorn F150. I guess the Corvette can wait until next year.	"If you just want a quick description of the truck and pictures, skip down to the last paragraph. If you want my life story...

Confession time, I'm addicted to finding deals on Craigslist, and addicted to perpetually shopping for vehicles I don't need. I also have a soft spot for odd option combos, and vehicles with perfect histories.

Anyway, I have been slowed down on my Craigslist hunting the last couple months since I picked up my Jeep. The BRZ still has low miles and a warranty, so no need to replace that...

I went to Corvettes at Carlisle last weekend, and my lifelong desire for a Corvette ramped up severely. The last couple fun cars I bought were almost Corvettes, but I wound up with something else each time. I decided I want to finally do it next year, so I started researching the market.

Looking back, the last two times I shopped for a new second vehicle (snow, cargo space, etc), I looked for 10th gen F150s with the V8, 4x4, Manual, and an extended cab. I was starting to think they didn't exist, since the rare manuals I saw were V6 2wd or V8 4x4 regular cab.

In my aimless Craigslist refreshing of all manual transmission vehicles within like 50 miles, this truck popped up. 2000 F150: V8, Manual, 4x4, Extended Cab, Off Road Package, Tow Package, 1 owner, 103k miles, black, clean, bench seat, all service history, new tires, bla bla bla, $5.5k. I emailed him immediately, test drove and brought home the next day. He had to order it custom that way and even had the window sticker. All the big service items have been taken care of recently and he even detailed it (including polishing) before I showed up.

2450	E30 gas in 99 Cadillac Eldorado	Hello everyone! I have a cadillac eldorado 99 and I was wondering if anybody has had any experience using e30 (30% ethanol) gas mix? It's a non flex fuel vehicle. If you are wondering why I want to do this, the manual states I need 91 octane gas or higher or it will run badly. It says nothing about any specific ethanol levels, just needs to be 91 octane or better. Well the manual is right. It runs SUPER BAD on 87 octane, knocks, pings, misfires, and you can seriously feel the drop in power, all the issues go away when using the 91 as stated. Well 91 is super expensive compared to 87 ($3.20 vs 2.67). E30 94 octane is only $2.52! So it seems like I have a chance to get the performance of the expensive stuff and still pay less than I would for the useless regular. I have heard of people doing this manually by mixing e85 with the standard 87 gas to make 94 e30. It so happens a new gas station opened in my area with the new mixer pumps, and it has the option to make e30 for you by the same process and comes out the same hose. I've done alot of reading and it seems there should be no reason it shouldn't work. South dakota in 2016 started the e30 challenge where they extensively tested it in many non flex fuel vehicles and found that basically any car made after 1996 the computers would be able to adjust to the e30 just fine and run nearly with the same mpg as the regular gas. In fact the higher ethanol gives higher compression and actually improves performance and the higher octane improves the knock resistance. What I want to know is if anybody beyond these big testing groups have actually TRIED THIS themselves and had success? I haven't been able to find any posts about it anywhere. The only thing I read is that higher ethanol CAN damage or corrode some of the plastic parts and stuff in non FFVs, but it seems it applies to e85 mainly, and really only if you let your vehicle sit for a long time. My cadillac is my only car and my daily driver for work, so it won't be sitting for weeks on end without being driven. I fill up about 2 times a month. I know the real answer is to just try it and test the performance and see if any problems arise. I just want to hear if any of you guys have had experience with this. Thank you all!	cars

2453	2003 Mazda Protege Stereo Upgrade Question	"I'm about to start my career and very kindly my grandmother gifted me her old car.  Besides it being 15+ years old it is in great condition (~60k miles).  My only issue with the car, if you could call it that, is the stereo.  It has the stock CD player/radio right now, and I was thinking about upgrading it to a more modern stereo that has bluetooth.

My questions are these:

1) Is this a job I could do myself?  I watched a few video online and it seems like 70% of it would just be removing the old stereo, 10% wiring a harness adapter, 20% routing wires.

2) If this is a doable job, are there many tools/parts I would need?  It seems like tools are just a few removal tools and wire strippers.  Parts are: New stereo, Install kit (like a new bracket for the stereo), Harness Adapter, Crimp Caps, and Zip ties.

3) Is it better to just pay a professional to do this and if so how much would that generally cost?

4) Is this a waste of my time, and I should just buy a radio transmitter.  Also if so, are there any that you guys suggest?  I remember back in the day having one of them for my iPod and it sucked lol.

2467	Are there any car brands or models(aside from the super luxury/sports cars) that do not go cheap on the construction/build quality/part quality?	"Let me first clarify and provide examples of what I am talking about. 

* I define *construction* as mechanical design specific to reliability. For example, I know some of the late 90s early 2000s Subaru boxers had an engine redesign that made them prone to blown head gaskets. This would be an example of cheap construction. The cut a corner to save time and money. Subaru’s are still fairly reliable but this was a clear cost cutting measure. Design quirks like odd button placement or bad infotainment design are not what I consider cheap/bad. I don’t care how impractical the creature comforts are.

 * I define * build quality* as the materials used. For example, my VW GTI has a plastic oil pan. That is cheap. Why is a metal oil pan not presents. It doesn’t have to be carbon fiber, but use plastics where appropriate. Don’t make crucial parts out of cheap material. A plastic dashboard is fine, plastic oil pan is not fine.

* I define *part quality* as the reliability and longevity of the part. For example my Golf GTI uses a plastic oil plug that is designed to fail. 

I know every automaker that makes cars under $40,000 are doing something to cut corners but who is doing the least corner cutting? Who is making a car that just works. Even Toyota and Honda are using cheap materials in places they shouldn’t these days. Just about every car brand(excluding Nissan CVTs) is reliable these days if you car for it, but there has to be some objectively that is doing something utilitarian. "	cars
2468	Car serviced and vandalized story	"Two weeks ago I took my Nissan Murano 2012 to the Nissan dealer for regular oil change. After inspection it was found that 2 brakes and rotors need replacement, and a couple of sway bar links need change, CVT fluid, injector flush etc so almost $1500 work. 

Anyhow; work is done and  when leaving the dealership I noticed ""ABS"" and "" AWD"" warning lights were on, I though they will go off soon, car was working fine so I did not worry. Lights did not go off so, 1 week after, I checked the manual which said that it is abnormal and car needs to be seen by a mechanic.

The day I was returning to the dealer I noticed another warning light went on, the"" BRAKE"" one, on arrival I explained the situation to technician  who, after inspecting the car,  showed me that both front ABS/brake sensors were cut off. He told me that warning lights were on because of that. Service advisor  told me straightforwardly this was vandalism,  these wires (they look like thin hoses next to each wheel) are not exposed. I told him lights were on when I left the dealership 2 weeks ago. Dealership denied any wrongdoing on its part, advised me to put a police report and stay safe because someone tried to mess up my car brakes.

It is almost impossible this could be done anywhere else, my car is in private secured parking spaces at home and at work and, again, the warning lights were on (except the ""BRAKE"")  when I picked up my car from the dealer 2 weeks before .

Any alternative explanation to vandalism?

#Ford Territory

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ford-territory-blue-1-800x542.jpg)

No, not the Australian vehicle based on the Falcon platform, but this SUV made in China, which is a badge-engineered Yusheng 330.

It's got a 1.5-liter/143hp 4-cylinder turbo, but a PHEV hybrid is due soon.

Expected to sell for 90,000 CNY [that's around £10,100 - with VAT it'll be around £12,100], this is a budget SUV.

I like the looks of this one, and the EcoSport is too small and there's nothing smaller than the Kuga [Ford Escape in U.S. and Canada] in the line-up currently, so this would do the job.

#Chevrolet Orlando

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chevrolet-orlando-1-800x485.jpg)

This is another case of ""recycled name, different bodystyle"". 

It's got a 1.3-litre/156hp 4-cylinder turbo, although if it came to the U.S. or Canada wouldn't it get a 1.8 or 2.0 turbo?

I like the minivan-meets-crossover-SUV looks of this one.

Since Ford seem keen to launch new SUVs, I wouldn't mind one of these truck-based ones - we only get the Ranger pick-up here, which is in itself a pretty good vehicle.

I like the idea of the 2.0-liter/210hp 4-cylinder bi-turbo turbodiesel engine [2.0 TDCi EcoBlue 210], but I doubt it'd come here to the United Kingdom.

However, I'd probably go for the 2.5-liter/164hp 4-cylinder or the up-and-coming 2.3-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost [will this have around 280hp-300hp if I'm correct]?

It's a truck-like SUV, but that's one reason I like it.

The dealer needs to do a better job on cleaning some of these cars on the lot but did a lot of the presentation have to do with bad fabric. It seems like there were some things that were solid and some areas they went cheap on. 

Also I've seen references to people complaining about the seats but most google search results were from 2015 or earlier. They felt firm and tolerable but most said it wasn't really felt except on long drives. Does this still exist in the 2018s or later?

I'm cross shopping with the Forester so this is obviously the cheap option. I liked most of the features in the base better (except for the fabric) than the supposed upgrades and once you add AWD and leather to the HRV you're in Forester territory anyway. "	cars

It jerked under idle power forward and back, and sometimes was hard to start. So I took it into a local mechanic that I trusted and they decided that it was the PCV valve / assembly. When I picked it up it was worse... amazingly my A/C was no longer cooling and the car jerked even more, braked weird and even got a stability control error. I took it back up and they re-scanned it. The codes said I had some BUS communication errors with the A/C and a misfire on cylinder 2.

At that point they were scratching their heads as the PCV valve shouldn't of caused any other issues. They mentioned it wasn't even close to the A/C components so they didn't even suspect the mechanic knocked something loose etc. And that point they recommended taking it into the dealer.

So I did and I just got a call that it was a bad injector and A/C sensor.

Now I am wondering if messing around with the PCV valve could knock out the A/C sensor somehow? Or is this just an amazing coincidence? I can't find anyone with opinions on this. Also... could both the injector and PCV valve of been bad? Or do you think they just shot from the hip, I assume those symptoms make sense. But I didn't know what others did in these situations when a mechanic replaces something and it's not right.

2523	[OC] Dispelling the myth that Americans uniquely dislike manual transmission – The opposite might be true!	"**TLDR at bottom**

So, you hang out long enough in car forums, and eventually you’ll see sentiment like this: “Damned [other] American drivers, hating manual transmission, if Americans didn’t hate manual so much, I can get [insert car here] in manual!” This usually shows up in discussions about how certain car models are losing the manual transmission, or in reviews of new cars when someone says something along the lines of “I’d love to buy [insert car], but it doesn’t come in manual”. 

Plenty of people seem to believe that Americans (and Canadians I guess) uniquely dislike manual transmission, that consumers outside of North America like manuals. Many different explanations are given by various different people about why this phenomenon exists, yet the idea that north American buyers uniquely hate manual has almost never been questioned. After all, 2% of new cars sold in the US today are manual.

Well I’m not denying that buyers in North American are more likely to buy automatic, but I’ve always thought the idea that only buyers in North America hate manual transmission is a myth. Today, I’m going to prove that North American buyers don’t uniquely dislike manual transmission, that the same phenomenon exists in similar forms in two other key markets (China and Germany). I will also show that there exists evidence the opposite might even be true, enthusiasts in North Americans uniquely love manual transmission.

Let’s start with China, they are the world’s biggest country, and the world’s biggest automotive market by number of cars sold. [The market share for automatics in China is around 70%](https://www.jiemian.com/article/1719103.html), way lower than in the United States, but let’s break down the numbers shall we?

I went on China’s well known automotive website Autohome (think Chinese Car and Driver) to look for cars. First thing I did, was to look at the sports car category, set the filter to manual transmissions only, and I got, [nothing. Well, ok, not exactly nothing, but you get a bunch of Morgans, and that weird X-Bow thing made by KTM, the motorcycle company.](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-7-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html) 

Yep, that’s right, with the discontinuation of the Toyota 86 (2017 was the last model year), not a single sports car in China is sold with manual. What about the Mustang you ask? Automatic only. The Camaro? Automatic only. BMW M2? Auto only. 718? Same thing, automatic only. 

Of course, you can get base Civics, Corollas, Cavaliers (Chevy’s volume compact is the Cavalier in China), etc in manual. But let’s say, I want a car with some basic luxuries. So I went back to the search page, and looked for a manual transmission car with a few basic features that one would consider “premium” in 2018: Leather powered seats, cruise control, LED headlights, and automatic climate control. [What I got was 1 car in the whole Chinese market, some crappy FWD SUV that is never sold outside of China](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-2_6_7_9_13-0-0-0-0-0-1.html#!). (It is also a pretty blatant Acura ripoff, it even has the beak haha). You can’t even find a car with heated seats with manual in China.

Think about it for a second. If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a manual sports car? If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a car that is equipped with the most basic options with manual? The only way this makes sense IMO is that the majority of Chinese customers dislike manual, the only reason why manual’s market share is higher is because there are plenty of people who cannot afford the automatic option. In fact, the moment you start adding even the most basic options, you can’t get manual anymore. Why? Because overall, Chinese consumers prioritize automatic to the point where, if they can only afford a single option, it would be the automatic transmission.

Now let’s take a look at Germany, I picked them as an example because they have a strong domestic automotive industry, and that German automobiles are exported worldwide, including to North America. So I went on the German website mobile.de to look at listings (AKA, cars currently advertised for sale), and overall, 58% of new car listings are manual. Hey, that’s pretty good for manual transmissions you’d think! But let’s dig a bit further.

Let’s start with sports cars shall we? So I selected the sports cars and convertibles option, and immediately the manual transmission rate drops to 31%. Now the rate is probably actually even lower because this weird [Piaggio APE Calessino Euro 4 3 wheeled thing](https://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=266939234&amp;categories=Cabrio&amp;categories=SportsCar&amp;damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&amp;isSearchRequest=true&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;scopeId=C&amp;usage=NEW&amp;fnai=next&amp;searchId=74bb0a1b-ef47-f5e2-66b3-03eb5f83503e) that only comes in manual counts as a “convertible”, which I don’t think counts as a car for obvious reasons (There’s also a huge number of manual Beetle, Smart, and Fiat 500 listings, cars I don’t necessarily consider sports cars). Hmm, so overall, German sports car drivers prefer automatic over manual? This almost seems like the opposite of what we see in North America. 

Let’s dig in a little bit deeper and break it down shall we? Overall, 26.1% of Audi, 20.9% of BMW, and 8.59% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual. But remember, in Germany (unlike many export markets), these brands aren’t necessarily “luxury”, they also sell lower specced entry level vehicles (IE: The 318i with cloth interior). If we were to limit these brands to their higher priced offerings only, the manual rate again drops sharply. 

Above 50 thousand euros, only 1.01% of Audi, 1.97% of BMW, and 0.09% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual, in line with manual take rates in the United States. In fact, once you consider Porsche (a company that doesn’t sell cars cheaper than 50 thousand dollars/euros), American Porsche buyers are slightly more likely to buy manuals, 3.87% of German listings are manual, but 4.13% of American ones (on autotrader) are. 

Now if you go and search German sports car and convertible listings above 50 thousand euros, only 11% of them are manual. Interestingly enough, more than a quarter of them are Mustangs, and nearly 16% of them are Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes (Chevrolet literally has 5 dealers in all of Germany). There are currently 27 manual BMW sports cars or convertibles being advertised in Germany above the price of 50 thousand at this moment. Zero Mercedes Benz, and 3 Audis. If we use 50 thousand as the threshold for ""high end"", the German big 3 has a total of 30 high end sports cars for sale. Adding in Porsche, the big 4 German luxury brands have a total of 102 high end sports cars for sale. In comparison, if we search high end sports cars above $50 thousand USD (I know it is lower than 50 thousand euros, but european prices contain tax), 15% of them are manual on autotrader, and a good number of them are Audi's and BMWs. 

So I would conclude that German buyers are in a way similar to American and Chinese buyers in that they don’t show preference for manual transmissions, after all, German manufacturers don’t offer their flagships in manual. For instance, you can get a manual Mercedes Benz A class, but you can’t get a Mercedes Benz S class in manual. But unlike American and Chinese customers, Germans don’t consider automatic too high on their priorities list, they are willing to spend the money on certain other options before selecting automatic, but the fundamental phenomenon is still the same. Germans don’t prefer manual when they are willing to spend money, as Germans who buy expensive cars overwhelmingly choose automatic. In fact, I’m willing to take it one step further, Germans don’t like manual, they just dislike it a little less than Americans and Chinese drivers do.

I’m going to extrapolate a little bit from these two key markets and say that, to the majority of consumers worldwide, automatic is the preferred transmission. After all, good modern automatics are faster and/or get better fuel economy. The only difference is how willing consumers are to spend money on the automatic option (and how much money they have to spend in General). North American car buyers are simply more willing to spend money on the automatic (and on so many North American model cars, auto is a no-cost option). 

In fact weirdly enough, the data suggests that American enthusiasts might be the largest group of people who prefer manual out there. After all, the highest end American performance cars are all available with manual (Hellcat Challenger, Shelby Mustang, Corvette), but the same cannot be said about German (AMG GT, Audi R8, TTRS, hell, any AMG) or Japanese (Nissan GTR, Lexus LC, Lexus LFA) performance cars. Of the four German brands that make performance cars (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche, and Audi), two of them (BMW, Porsche) claim that it was American demand that allowed them to sustain manual transmission development. Hell, Chinese enthusiasts don't care for manual at all! Even the Miata is automatic only in China. 

So in conclusion, the data suggests that US consumers aren’t the only ones who dislike manual transmission, consumers China, Germany, and likely other markets probably don’t like manual either. In fact, US enthusiasts are probably the ones that you should thank for the continual existence of the manual transmission performance car. 

**TLDR:** American customers aren't unique in preferring automatic over manual, they're just the ones most willing/able to pay for it. But American enthusiasts may very well be unique in their overwhelming preference for manual transmission. "	cars

2525	Need some advice	"This might be a long shot, but I want some advice because I cannot figure out what the issue might be with my car. 

I have a Renault Mégane 1.6 16v Sport 1999. Lovely car, apart from one thing... I have a high idle speed when it's cold up to about 2000 RPM, unless I release the clutch slightly in which case it'll go to about 1100RPM. Sometimes when I'm driving along it'll accelerate slightly by itself if I take my foot of the gas pedal, then suddenly slowing after about 30 seconds. Switching off the engine when at a complete stop will judder the entire car. 

Once the car has reached optimal temperature of 90°C, the problem basically disappears.

I've repositioned the throttle cable as it wasn't in the correct place, which sorted the issue temporarily. I'm possibly thinking spark plug, but there is no check engine light and it's been acting like this for a few months now. Possibly a bad throttle body?

I don't want to go to a garage and be charged X amount."	cars
2526	Best alternative wheel and tire outlet in the USA?	"I've been trying to find a set of wheels and tires for my '93 NSX.  For the life of me, Tirerack has an abysmal selection of wheels, even in 17/18"".  The wheels they do offer have bad offsets.  I've called them without further success.

Discount Tire is the same.

So, where else should I be looking?

FWIW I'm trying to find a set of 17x7.5-8 and 18x9.5-10 wheels at approx +40mm offset.  Looking to mount on 215/40R17 and 265/35R18. I like tireracks Enkei PF01, but I would have to buy a +50mm offset, which won't work."	cars
2527	"2007 Hyundai Elantra - RPMs ""bouncing"" after auto shift - is this normal behavior?"	"Video can be seen here - https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/9bmdt4/rpms_after_shift_on_elantra_is_this_normal/

A bit of background. A few weeks ago I purchased a used 07 Elantra. It very quickly presented an issue with the transmission (limp home mode with a TCC solenoid code along with trans temp sensor code). Dealer replaced the temp sensor and the issue has not reemerged.

That said, now I’m hyper sensitive to how the transmission is performing. I’ve noticed a behavior and would love to know if it’s at all abnormal.

As you’ll see in the gif, when it shifts from 3rd to 4th, the RPMs fall, but... bounce slightly?

I have no loss of power or lack of smoothness to the cars engine. Only the lack of smoothness to the falling RPMs between gears. Any reason to be concerned? Is this completely normal behavior?

Thanks in advance!"	cars
2528	Hi guys - Few issues with a Peugeot 206, need some advice.	"So, some basics:

Year: 2009

Transmission: Manual

Fuel type: Petrol

Miles: 74k


Over the past week or 10 days I’ve noticed a problem. It started with the back of the car shuddering on take off, like it was lagging behind the rest of the car. The clutch pedal has also become stiffer, it takes slightly more effort to depress it than usual. I dunno if I’m imagining it, but I think it’s also got a higher biting point than it used to. 

Then, this morning I got into reverse, and the whole car was shuddering when I was reversing at the biting point. I’m gonna book into a mechanic ASAP, but could you guys give me some advice as to what exactly could be causing it? No engine lights are on. Even though it flashes on when I turn the ignition, so the light isn’t broken. 

Could it be the clutch? I’ll check the service history but think a new clutch was fitted by the old owner at ~55k miles. I know I need a new timing belt fitted, but should I be prepared for anything else?

2543	Buy an extended warranty or trade in 2015 Buick Enclave	"My wife drives a 2015 Buick Enclave with ~62K miles, which we are still paying off ($17,000 remaining). We've had a few problems (AC leak, a faulty sensor) which of course came in right after the warranty expired, and she's just not feeling like this has lots of reliability in it. Everything so far seems to be up around the $750 to $1500 range to fix, and that'll add up very quickly **if** other stuff goes wrong.

We started talking about trading it in (looking at an Acura MDX), but financially that's a big hit. I figure the Enclave probably has enough value to cover the payoff, but that's it. So I'm not convinced that's a good route to go. The flip side is we take a few long trips in the December-February time frame (several hours each way in northeast USA) for teenage daughter's sporting commitments, and having the peace of mind that we won't break down on a busy road in wintry conditions is worth a lot.

I got a quote for an extended warranty for 4 years/80K miles that came in at $4,639. That seems high; what reputable companies should I approach for a quote? Is that price reasonable?

Summary: should we call it quits on the Enclave and trade it in (accepting it's going to be harsh financially), get an extended warranty to hedge financially, or cross fingers and hope the problems we've had so far aren't indicative of more to come?"	cars

2554	Painful dragging sound in 3rd gear	I just bought a 6 speed 2001 Mazda Miata SE less than a week ago, the man I bought it from took really great care and had receipts for all repairs done. One of the repairs being a new clutch (not sure if that has any significance). I’ll be the first to say I’m not amazing at driving stick, but I’m definitely not the worst. I’ve gotten fairly decent in the past few days at shifting and whatnot, but every time I shift into third gear this painful metallic dragging sound comes from somewhere in the car (I can’t figure out if it’s coming from the front or beneath- I’m assuming it’s the front), it’s continuous and builds volume until I reach 2-25000 rpms and then it just stops completely.

EDIT: The vehicle in question is a 2016 Nissan Murano. No donuts here, haha. Even when spinning wheels ar low speeds, it constantly cuts power with TC iff, very frustrating.

EDIT 2:  The main reason I ask is that occasionally I'll have to pull out where there's a really bad shoulder and I cant see what's coming, plus I'm on gravel...so it kills engine power when I pull out and puts me in a position where traction control (despite it being 'off') has almost caused me to get in a wreck multiple times."	cars

The 2007 IS350 sported the longitudinal 2GR-FSE (roughly the same motor, but with direct+port injection) with 306bhp. 3,430-3,650lbs (pretty similar).

Most accounts listed the IS350 as doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds.

The Camry V6 was listed by most accounts as doing 0-60 in 5.8-5.9 seconds.

I’m wondering why this would be. You would think the Camry would be at a major disadvantage of being FWD (with terrible weight distro), having an open diff, and having skinny 215 tires.

The IS350 is slightly handicapped from the get-go by having an open diff and only 225-width tires, but wouldn’t the RWD be enough to at least give it a 0.3+ second head start in straight-line acceleration?

Obviously handling will be day and night- that is no question. But it seems the IS was a severe underperformer given the power output and other cars in its class. Maybe the 4.09 diff ratio was ill-suited to the transmission?"	cars
2563	Its not always cheaper to buy then rent...[RANT]	"Just like Yoplait, sweet tldr on the bottom, life story on top.

So, a little background. My wife and I are from the Balkans, and since we had kids, we've been coming to Croatia every summer for at least 5 weeks to hang out with family and to expose the kids to our native culture. We also travel a lot when we come, so in the past we had been renting cars. This usually ends up costing about 2000 euros per month because we always need a van or wagon and we travel internationally, etc. 

This year I managed convince my work to let me work remotely, so we decided to come for 3 months instead. Well, I didn't feel like dropping 6000 euros for a rental car so we decided we should just buy our own, and leave it with my mother in law, so we would have a car that  would be cheaper than renting over time, and worst case scenario, could re-sell and be out of pocket a much smaller amount. We decided to get a wagon, van or suv and budgeted 8000 euros as our limit.

Well, I know a bit about cars, so I did a bunch of craigslist (njuskalo) shopping around before we came and had lined up a bunch of cars to go take a look at. I even brought my OBD2 reader as backup. Well after spending a week going to see a bunch of used and abused jalopies, we finally found a really nice 2013 Peugeot 508SW 2.0HDI. It was high milage (140,000) but the guy who owned it was a traveling salesman and took really good care of it. It only had 3 issues I wasn't stoked on.

1. Its a 6 speed semi auto...really wanted a manual in Europe of all places
2. It needed a new coolant hose, the old one just looked a little worn
3. The guy had his elbow in the same place for 5 years and had actually created a dent in the interior door panel.

Apart from that the car was great. I did a full under and over inspection on it, it drove great, shifted great, no faults, no creaks nothing. The guy was asking $9000 for it, but I managed to talk him down to eight.

Immediately I took it to the dealer and had them change out all the fluids, filters and the messed up hose and update all the software to the latest version. I also had them change out the timing belt and water pump as those are the first to go. This service cost me another 1000euros, but I figured if we're gonna hang onto this car for a few years, its gonna be worth making sure its in great shape.

And it was. We drove it up and down the coast, went to Italy with it and a bunch of city driving, and the kids got a kick out of going through all the tunnels with the panoramic roof. Then one day as we were headed to Italy for the second time, we got stuck in the border crossing line and as we're stop and going, the transmission starts to jerk...A LOT. It feels like it drops out of gear, then just slams it into 1st when I let off the brake. I put it into manual mode and its fine, but I was getting sketched out. I park it in Trieste for a few hours, and on the trip back, it shifts fine. Then a few days later we're headed to one of the islands and I notice that every time it shifts from 5th to 4th its rough.

My first though is that its oil, but I did a bunch of research and apparently these gearboxes are supposed have lifetime oil, but a bunch of people have issues with the valve bodies going to shit (Aisin AW6 if you're interested). So I take it back to the authorized service center and they wont touch automatics and they send me to a little mom and pop shop that apparently specializes in autos. I call them, but they're booked for a week and we were going to Dalmatia the following week so no one would be able to touch it for 2 weeks. We drive down (about 250 miles) the next week and its definitely shifting rough, but since its mostly freeway, it never really leaves 6th gear. 

So finally we get back last week and the very next day I take it to the shop and the guy tells me its probably just the oil. They go to change it and its tar black. They end up changing it twice, just because it was in such a bad condition, a single change it was still bleeding black. Apparently they recommend changing that oil every 60000km and call the ""lifetime"" label bullshit. He also tells me to drive it around for a while and if its still rough, we'll probably going to have to change the valve body (1000 euro for the part + labor).

Next few days Im driving it around and its night and day. The car is more responsive, smooth, dare I say feels faster. No issues in traffic, no rough shifts. I think AWESOME, a $100 gear oil change just saved my ass. So yesterday I had a doctors appointment in Ljubljana, about 2 hours away and in a different country. The family and I decide to make it a day trip and as we're driving out there the car is doing great. No issues at speed, smooth shifts, the border crossing handled like a champ! That is until the second we got off the highway in Ljubljana. As I'm pulling up to the light, the gearbox clunks, and ""Gearbox Fault, get immediate service"" message comes on the dash. The car locks me in 3rd gear but luckly its a diesel, so it has the needed torque to get it going...but I top out at about 40mph. So I limp it to the doctors office, get my exam and while waiting find a Peugeot dealer...only dealer in the fucking country, a few miles away. So we jump in the car again, and the fault is gone, but its shifting rough again. I get it to the dealer after a day to diagnose it, I get the bad news...I need a new valve body...to the tune of 2100 euros. 

I looked up used trannies for this car, called around, and in Croatia I would have ended up having to pay around $1500 euros, but with towing fees, it would come out about the same. So my whole plan of buy a car for 8000 euros because it will pay off in a year or two, is now a car of 12000  euros...and its still a fucking automatic...sigh.

TLDR: Visiting Croatia for 3 months, decided it would be cheaper to buy a car then rent one. Bought a used car from a private party, inspected it, scanned it, drove it. Everything was great, then the automatic gearbox starts acting up. Changed the oil and boom, back to perfect again, then yesterday, I drove 2 hours to a different country only for it to throw up a ""gearbox fault"" and I'm out 2100 euros for a new valve body.

2581	What do you guy's think of Chrysler Corporation after the Lee Iacoca years?	"If there's one thing I've learned about Chrysler Corp in my years of being an automotive enthusiast, it's always that they were always a roller-coaster of successes and failures. They were always the underdog in third place fighting for the domestic market with Ford and General Motors.

The 70s almost saw them die, and the 80s saw their amazing resurgence. It seems however, their story kind of gets forgotten about towards the mid to late 90s, up to the present day. 

I mean that in both terms of models sold, and company reputation. Nobody ever talks about Chrysler besides their performance oriented line of vehicles. In an ironic way, AMC's formidable Jeep subdivision seems to have been (and still be?) Chrysler's most valuable asset. 

I'm not sure what got me on this train of thought. I think it's because I got interested in the Dodge Intrepid SXT models, and realized the total lack of interest for any of Chrysler's more casual or low tier sport vehicles. Was their reliability that horrible? Was it just Chrysler suffering from smaller market share? 

In my day to day life, I still see tons of late 90s and early 00s GM or even Ford vehicles. Chrysler Corp passenger vehicles just seem to be all but gone. I still see a load of trucks and jeeps though. 

As a casual observer, does anyone have any fond memories of Chrysler's vehicles in the late 90s? Were they any good? 
What do you think of their brand focus today? 

I kind of can't believe Chrysler ditched the affordable compact market in favor of ""muscle"" cars, cuvs/suvs, and trucks. I mean, the dart was all but unadvertised. It's barley even getting any performance oriented attention either. I've also heard general reliability is a lot to be desired as well. 

It seems like the company hasn't known what the hell they're doing since the 08 recession. Possibly even prior to that. Regardless of sales, they still seem to be suffering in reliability. 

Edit: Some words because people are anal.

2582	Suspected Head Gasket Leak?	2005 Honda Cr-v 111k miles. Just bought this car. Cylinder 4 was misfiring so I replaced the spark plugs and that seemingly solved the problem.. until now. My car has had rough idle but it would usually go away if I turned off the AC, so I didn’t think much of it. Today my engine light came back on for a Cylinder 4 misfire again. Now, when I replaced the spark plugs, I also had someone check the coils and he said there was no problem with the coils. So, I don’t feel like I need to replace the coil. Recently, I took my car to the mechanic for an unrelated issue and when I had my boyfriend follow me back he noticed a thin white smoke coming out of my exhaust. This was also in the morning so I figure it could be condensation. Another problem I have is coolant loss. So, i’m afraid I may have a head gasket leak. I’m running a compression test tomorrow.

2592	Worth dealing with rust?	"We own a 2006 Honda Pilot.  Have had for several years, under 120k miles.

 This vehicle has been 90% garage kept, generally left out in the summer as our garage becomes filled with bikes/scooters, etc.  

This gen of Pilot has some very common rust issues. I see it pretty much every time I see this model around here (Ohio).

Local body shop that has a rep for being quality and low priced quoted $700 to fix these spots and would need to keep the car for 3 days.  They said they would be cutting out metal, replacing, painting.  The car is probably only worth $5-6k, so I have trouble with the idea of dropping that much on an older vehicle for what seems like a cosmetic problem.

https://m.imgur.com/a/TBRoT2h

Is it really just a cosmetic problem only, or is this going to lead to bigger problems?  We just bought a newer van so this is pretty much just a vehicle for me to drive back and forth to work, the family trips will be in the van.  I intend to drive this for at least 3-5 more years unless some big repair or something else gets in the way. 

I've also searched around on YT for videos, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4vusY2-rkQ 

I know this might not be the way to properly fix this, but if I can get it looking cosmetically better for under $100 I'm not opposed to that.  I realize the correct way is probably taking it to the pros at the shop, I just can' decide if it's worth that.

2593	Is it safe to put Rock Wool insulation in a car? (Miata specifically)	"As most know, the OG miata's are plagued by copious amounts of road noise - mostly caused by the tunnels that lead from the trunk to cabin. There are small openings here and there where it can breath into the cabin. The cavity pretty much amplifies road noise. A lot of people have had success quieting their cars by filling the cavities- which is what i wan to do. 

I was thinking of using acoustic roxul rock wool -however the only thing that worries me is having so much rock wool concentrated in a tiny miata cabin.  This might sound a bit stupid - but I've never use such insulation  and I'm not sure if its safe - i.e bumps causing fibers to float around and being breathed in by me and a passenger.

Alternate option is fulling bags with the stuff and forcing it in the cavity. 

**Question: Is it safe to just ram it in, or should i take more precautions and fill bags and stuff the bags in the car. As a side note material is water and fireproof.**

2603	A Month With Giulia	"Hey all, I picked up an Alfa Romeo Giulia just a little over a month ago and figured I’d pass on my first impressions about the car.


**Background**: I leased the car on July 23rd. It’s a 2018 Ti Lusso Q4. I went with the Lusso over the Ti Sport because the seats in the sport felt very uncomfortable due to their really aggressive bolstering and I’m a pretty large guy (6’2” 240lbs).


**Price**: The car’s MSRP was around 53k, but after everything I had over 10k in discounts/rebates. I leased it at 2 years, 12k/year, and put absolutely nothing down. My payment is $500/month. I had done most of my research on Edmunds and LeaseHackr and had an idea of what I wanted to pay; I basically brought my research and calculations in with me and showed them I felt I should be able to get it for and ended up paying within a few dollars of my goal.


**Exterior**: I think the car looks great and rather sporty. I went with the Vesuvio Gray Metallic paint and it hides dirt well. It’s a bit lower than my last car, a 2015 Hyundai Genesis, but not by much and I’m pretty used to lower cars. I live in one of the snowiest cities in America, so we’ll see how it goes through the winter, but with snow tires and AWD it should be simple considering I drove a 2002 Dodge Neon with bald tires for a few years in college in the same weather.


**Interior**: I went with the one with red leather. I love it. The overall interior is high quality with a lot of soft touch surfaces in all the right places. It was a bit small at first coming from the Genesis, but I have no problems with it now. I don’t think anyone much taller than I could fit into the seat without their head touching the ceiling. The trunk and trunk opening are relatively small, but I can fit most things I need to in there and the seats fold down (thank god, they didn’t in the Genesis). The back seat is somewhat tight with taller people sitting up front but would be fine for shorter trips. My back seat is occupied by 2 dogs 99% of the time so it isn’t a problem.


**Technology**: The controls in general are pretty intuitive. There are some exceptions. The turn signal stock doesn’t click and stay in the spot you push it in to, it basically just goes up/down and then back to center. A hard push keeps the signal on until you complete a turn and a lighter one just blinks a few times for lane changes. It took a bit to get used to at first, but I’m used to it now.


The engine auto start/stop is interesting, but annoying when it’s hot out. It shuts the AC off for the most part and it can get hot inside quick. It does, however, fire up fast and I haven’t had any issues with it. I turn it off when it’s hot out.


My one gripe is the lack of touch screen, but I’ve also gotten used to that. Though I would still like one. It does have CarPlay and Android Auto but using them without a touch screen is somewhat annoying. The click wheel in the center works fine for navigating for the most part and the rest of the controls are all on the wheel or easily accessible. The entertainment system does boot up the instant I turn the car on, which is great since the Genesis would take a few seconds (or longer sometimes).


All the other fancy driving aids seems to work well. The adaptive cruise I’ve used several times and works fine, the lane departure warning works, but it doesn’t automatically steer you back into the lane so I’ve just turned it off since it can get annoying (it makes a sound that sounds like rumble strips whereas the Genesis just had the wheel vibrate and steered you back into the lane which was great).


**Performance**: Coming from the boat that is the Genesis (currently the G80) this thing is quick and handles amazingly well. The steering is very tight. I opted for the adjustable dampers and it’s noticeable going between the two levels. 


In normal driving mode the car is pretty standard, quiet, and handles the road well. In Dynamic (aka Sport) mode it is significantly tighter, rougher, and you can feel every part of the road (which is awesome). Sport also seems to tighten up the steering and the way it manages the gears is very aggressive compared to other cars with a sport mode that I’ve driven. The way it manages the gears and feels in general is reminiscent of a Ferrari 488 I recently drove on vacation in Italy (which I guess makes sense). There is definitely a huge difference between normal and Dynamic modes; far more than any car I’ve driven in the past.


In both modes the paddles are amazing. They feel great and respond extremely quick.


There is also a mode called Advanced Efficiency which I cannot review as I have only ever driven in it during the test drive, though I think the way it gimps the throttle response will be helpful in the winter.


I think the epa mpg is something like 23/31. In my first 1500 miles or so I’ve sat around 20mpg city and the one long road trip I took was over 38mpg highway (cruising at ~80 the whole way, which is even more impressive). I could definitely improve the city mileage, but na.


Feel free to ask any questions!

Edit: I forgot to mention, I was super annoyed because apparently WeatherTech doesn't make front mats for this car, so I ended up going with these ones called Tux Mats. They are really nice and match the quality of the interior really well.

Here are a couple pics of the car and of the floor mats/seat: https://imgur.com/a/bKHzugB

I've been eager to learn how tire pressure affects the heat-up of the tires.

My logic says the less PSI you have, the more the tire will deform thus will heat up quicker, also due to a bigger contact patch.

However, my friend says it's the opposite and that reducing tire pressures allow the tire to cool down as it isn't pressed down as hard.

Is there a definitive answer?

2632	On-the-go Auto repairs in Mad Max: Fury Road, Is This Possible?	"Evening r/cars.
I've been watching Mad Max: Fury Road like, once a year now, because I love the movie. However something cool (but also maybe unrealistic, maybe) I've always noticed is that at least twice in the film the War Rig (an 18-wheeler tanker) is tuned up or repaired *while the Rig is still in motion and active.* Here's a fuzzy clip from youtube of Furiosa going under the cab to do repairs while the rig is still in motion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWaNT3byVU

I guess my question is, in an 18-wheeler like we have in the movie, or any vehicle in general, is it actually possible to fix any part of the engine or coolant system while the vehicle is in use. About three times in Max Max: Fury Road does the engine(s) go out or become inoperative, and all of them *appear* to stem from overheating, so I'm going to assume all of the 'repairable' parts have to do with the coolant system, but I could be wrong. Also the rig appears to have more than one engine-- is this even possible?

Also this is probably not in the vein of this reddit, so I apologize if it's a bit of an off-shoot. I can't find clips of the main characters fixing the engine while it moves. But in either case, thanks and I look forwards to hearing your dude's ideas.

2634	Making sure a car is good for high-intensity use. 2011 mini cooper s.	"Hi. I recently(read: about 1 year ago) really got into cars. I never really paid too much attention to my own as they were hand-me-downs, but I've recently realized one of my cars is moderately decent and needs some serious love(2011 Mini cooper S. 2.0 liter turbo).

I'd like to be confident in this car to the point where I wouldn't be hesitant to take this car to a track/drag strip day or two. Granted, yeah, mini, but it does have a 0-60 of about 6 and a quarter mile in the 15-s. Either way, beggers can't really be choosers and I am not the richest man.

all that being said, it has about 60k miles. I've done regular service on time. Oil, coolant, tires, everything. It's probably never been taken above 5k rpms in it's entire life. Most if it's life has been driving 75mph in 6th gear with minimal clutch usage.

Is there anything special I should do or check before actually using the car to more of it's potential? There are no error codes, and there has never been an engine problem with this entire car.

So far, I'm planning on installing a boost gauge to see what the turbo is doing, in addition to installing a temperature gauge. I'm also planning on changing the oil and getting a coolant flush. Anything major I'm missing here?

I also want to maximize torque and horsepower by optimizing throttle tables, etc... I’m not looking for info on boosted applications either. I’m only NA right now. Maybe in the future I hope!

I don’t have a dyno at my disposal, so I’ll be street tuning instead. I have data logging, and table editing abilities. I know it’s not ideal, but I’m working with what I have. I’d rather learn something along the way then pay someone a ton of money for a result that I have to trust based on faith in their abilities. "	cars

2638	A question about fancy vs. budget tyres	"Hello people who know things about cars, I know little and come seeking your knowledge.

I need to buy four new tyres for my car. I use it normal use - commuting and occasional long distances (for the UK anyway), no racing or shenanigans like that. Currently I've got Continental tyres which came with the car. I'm led to believe they're relatively expensive as tyres go. They're double the price of some of the ones I'm seeing to replace them with.

My question is this: if I were to buy these ""budget"" tyres, would I notice any real difference in typical use? Would it feel any different? Would it last half the time of the comparatively expensive tyre? Is there any point in me paying more if I'm driving to work not a racetrack?

Thanks very much for your help!"	cars

I'm currently looking to gain some additional insight on this company if anyone is running into the same problems I am.

I purchased a gearset for my car (in full) on 3/3/2016. Since this time I've been given nearly every excuse in the book as to why my product has not yet shipped yet. Is there anyone else in the same boat as me? Did you eventually get your product, did you request a refund, or did you simply get bent over and had to eat the cost?

I've outlined every single e-mail I've gotten in over 2 years below (PARs responses, I can include mine if necessary). Am I wrong in thinking this is completely unacceptable?

It is bad that it has taken so long but during this time we have made many changes to the G5M set due to the new technology we have incorporated.
Your set will come with all the improvements.
Our previous sets are great and still out there with no issues but we always strive to improve and go forward for the better.
I have not read your complete email since I know it will depress and disappoint me but you have been humble throughout the whole ordeal and my only focus now is delivery.""

It seems like all the newer suv models have different safety cameras and/or sensors coming as standard.

It would be a great differentiated selling point, maybe even lower insurance costs! 3rd party options are clunky.	cars

But the big question is, how do I tell if they are in fact real or fake? Google tells me the BBS trademark stamp on the rim is an indicator that they are legit. But how true is that? Is here an expert who can tell? If needed, I can provide more pictures of any part of the rim.

2660	Sedan Tire Load Rating and Model Conideration	"Hi there,

I searched Load Rating here in the sub and read through a couple responses, but a little paranoid so figured I'd ask since I'm in a spot.  Thanks for the help.

​

2016 Honda Civic EX-T, OEM tire is a 215/50R17 91H

Currently limping around on my spare tire (left rear) after getting a nail that can't be repaired.  Donut tire.  Short 8 mile commute and minimal other driving.

My tire place has a 95V Michelin Premier A/S tire set in stock, but I could potentially order a 91H but would have to wait a week or two for delivery before I could install.

Is there a big issue and/or will it be negatively noticeable both from a ride quality or fuel issue to have a 95V vs the 91H?

​

Also... the tire I think really prefer (Michelin Primacy MXM4) is on back order.  Looking at the Premier, it's not as highly rated.  Tire guy said only complaint about Premier was they don't seem to get to their mileage warranty, but I don't drive all that much, so I figure tire will dry rot before I get that high in the miles.  Any thoughts on that?

​

Thanks much, and any other input appreciated.  FWIW - Trying to stick with Costco after previous bad experiences with Discount Tire.  Local place an option if necessary, though seems will be pricier.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Does a 95V tire vs an OEM 91H tire make any difference whatsoever for normal commuting type stuff?  And would it be worth waiting a week or two driving on a spare to get the 91H if so?"	cars

2664	Car Rant.	"I'm 21 years old and my family has an extra car laying around (my mothers old car that was meant for me and my brother when she got a new car) that I have been driving to and from Community College. It's a 2011 Toyota Corolla. It f\*cking sucks. It's the most bland boring vanilla car there is. It doesn't turn heads and does NOT get me p\*ssy like if I had a sports car. It's great on gas mileage though.

I'm a senior in college and I work part time while going to school and my mother insists that I just keep driving the Corolla while saving my money for a newer better car. My brother lives at school so while he's at school I get to drive the Corolla to and from my community college. (My mother said it's the equivalent towards his dorm...actually cheaper). So she doesn't mind me using it. I have $6k in the bank and it's growing. My dad tells me that he's impressed with how much money I have saved because when he was in college most of it went to stupid stuff and he never had around that much money. (Also because he lived on campus so he was limited to where and how much he could work). But $6k IS NOT ALOT OF MONEY. However I have to pay for my phone, gas, books, miscellaneous college stuff. I've been told by both my parents that If I continue to save by the end of the school year I will be on track with around $9-10k in my bank account. Enough (from them) to buy me a better newer safer ""cooler"" car.

As it sits now, at $6k I really couldn't even buy a new sports car??? Chances are my budget will limit me to an older Civic/Accord/Camry/Corolla so my parents said just drive the newer one that I am driving now. BUT IT PISSES ME THE FRICK OFF whenever I roll up to campus lot and see kids with new-ish WRX's, BRZ/FRS and Mustangs. How? HOW DID THEY AFFORD THAT?! I'm so salty and jealous of them. I work my ass off but I have to pay for phone, rent, books, gas, clothes, deodorant (that random shit). I am luckily provided free food because I do the dishes and earn my keep around the house.

HOWEVER I DRIVE A FRICKEN TOYOTA COROLLA! How am I suppose to impress the chicks like the kids with the WRXs, and Mustangs!?!?! HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HAVE A COOL FUN CAR.

I've been daily driving a '95 Miata with 175,000 miles for over a year and while I enjoyed the car at first, it's been having a ton of ""old car problems"" that's making me hate driving my car. The A/C doesn't work half the time and when it does blow cold, it screws with the idle of the car making it almost undrivable in traffic. The engine makes weird noises every once in a while. The old suspension has started creaking and groaning as I drive over every bump. I've replaced all of the coolant hoses, water pump, timing belt, valve cover gasket, and the old radiator cap and it's still leaking coolant and oil from somewhere. It's got cheap looking aftermarket wheels and literally the cheapest Walmart tires you can buy. The brand new cheapo soft top I spent an entire weekend installing just 8 months ago is already falling apart. The speakers sound like shit too so I can't even listen to my music in traffic without hearing static. I could go on and on and yet it still starts up every single morning and still looks decent for it's age.

Yeah it's a fun car and I still enjoy rowing through the gears and wringing out all that 125 hp when I get the chance. Yet, as a daily, it's been driving me crazy every day. I can't afford to do anything to it other than basic maintenance and I don't even have a garage anymore to work on it myself. I'd sell it but I honestly don't know what else I could replace it that would still be affordable, well-maintained by previous owners, and at least somewhat fun to drive.

2689	Fake badging rant.	"There's a kid I keep seeing on campus who has a E93 Bmw 335i convertible. 

The first time I saw it, I thought something looked fishy because he has the M3 carbon diffuser and vents cut into his hood. I went around back and saw an M3 badge (wrong size), pasted at a 45 degree angle on the trunk. 

I've seen him a few different times and last night I finally lost it in a drunken rant. I saw him stopped at a red light, asked him why his M3 has an N54 and the wrong fenders. He said ""cause i'm paid"", and drove off with all 6 cylinders firing. 

My confusion is essentially this- 

The only people that would know what an M3 is, or would be at all impressed by an M3, are the same people who can tell the difference between a real one and a copy. So what is the point of it? Insecurity? 

It's the same shit with fake AMG badging on the wrong side of the trunk, RS5 badges on an A5, etc. etc.

Has anyone gone back to an older vehicle and have regrets? I've been toying with the idea selling my LS project due to not wanting to have 3 project cars, and buying an actual commuter. That being said, I have enough friends in the local area with boringmobiles if we need to carpool or roadtrip or something similar."	cars

2701	This lovely lady bought a new AE86 in 1983 and has been driving it ever since.	"[**Instagram link with photos and video.**](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnQXNMBlcUW/?taken-by=amandaae86)

""A chance encounter with one of the coolest 86 owners I’ve ever met!

Popped down to the shops for milk &amp; came across this 86, it’s owner happened to be returning to it at the same time.

Meet Marie. She bought this sprinter brand new in 1983 &amp; has owned it since. When she purchased it she knew it would be the only car she’d ever buy, 35 years later it’s still her daily driver. 
She drove it across the Nullarbor from Tasmania to WA &amp; in her 35 years of ownership it only broke down on her once &amp; she cried when it was put on the tow truck! 

She is very particular about it’s maintenance, with one mechanic looking after it for her all it’s life. She mentioned she only uses genuine Toyota parts except for when her air con broke she had to get a spurious motor which she wasn’t too happy about!! She adored her 86 &amp; it really showed, the car was immaculate inside and out. She told me she gets inundated with guys following her around offering her big money for the car but she will never ever sell it. We chatted for a while and she enjoyed hearing about my corolla too. 

An absolute lady and huge 86 enthusiast! People are meant to cross paths for a reason I guess, Marie you are one of a kind &amp; I was so fortunate to meet you. 

Truly my pleasure. Legend!❤️ #ae86 #toyota #respect"""	cars

2704	Comparing the 2018 Ford Fusion vs the 2018 Ford Edge – Or why the crossover is winning	"**TL;DR at bottom**

So here on /r/cars, there is this endless debate over crossovers versus sedans, what their perceived advantages and disadvantages are, and why one would buy a crossover over a sedan. Well today, I thought I’d dig deep into the crossover vs sedan comparison, and I’ll dig deep into comparing the Ford Fusion and the Ford Edge, two midsized cars made by the same company on the same platform.

So first of all, let’s look at Fuel economy: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=39545&amp;id=39296&amp;id=39552&amp;id=39299

A FWD Fusion gets 1mpg better than a FWD Edge with the same engine. AWD Fusions and Edges get the same fuel economy. So obviously fuel economy isn’t a concern when choosing between the two.

On paper, it is possible to get Fusions for cheaper. The lowest MRSP for a Fusion is $22,840 while the Edge starts at $29,315. However, the cheapest Fusion is equipped to a much lower standard than the cheapest edge (steel wheels, 2.5L naturally aspirated engine, etc) than the cheapest Edge. A mechanically identical Fusion and Edge are nearly identical in price (2.0L Ecoboost AWD SEL Trim), with the Fusion being $32,165 and the Edge being $32,040. 

Now from a size perspective, the two cars are nearly identical. Fusions are 191.7 inches long, and 72.9 inches wide, while Edges are 188.1 inches long (2 row version) and 75.9 inches wide. So yeah, the Fusion is 3 inches longer while the Edge is 3 inches wider. When it comes to parking and maneuverability, I don’t think the two would be much different, as they have nearly identical footprints.

The big difference comes down to practicality. Passenger wise, the Edge gets you a solid 113.9 cubic feet of passenger volume, while the fusion only has 102.8 cubic feet. The Edge gets better head and shoulder room on both the front and second rows. When it comes to leg room, the Fusion wins with 2 more inches of front leg room, but the Edge has 2 more inches of rear leg room. 

Now when it comes to practicality, the Edge wins, and by a long shot. You get 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 2nd row, while the Fusion only gets 16 cubic feet of space in the trunk. The Edge also becomes significantly more useful once you put down the 2nd row, while the fusion doesn’t improve by too much due to the trunk opening design.

Now the Fusion does win in 1 way, acceleration. The 2.7L Ecoboost Fusion makes it to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds, while the 2.7 Ecoboost Edge does it in 5.6. (Numbers from Car and Driver). Aside: how does the Edge get the same fuel economy despite more weight? Probably due to gearing, which contributes to worse acceleration

Shocking however, the Edge does not lose to the Fusion in handling. The best handling Fusion is the Fusion Sport, which corners at 0.84g, while the Edge Sport with the identical drivetrain corners at 0.83g. The standard Fusion Sport takes 178 feet to stop from 70mph to 0, a number the Edge, well, edges out the competition at 176 feet. Why did the Fusion lose to the Edge? The Edge Sport comes with 245s, while the Fusion Sport comes with 235s. Now Ford Performance does offer a tire upgrade to performance summer tires, allowing the Fusion Sport to pull 0.89g on the skidpad and stop from 70mph in 155 feet (again, performance data from Car and Driver). 

But here’s the thing with the performance numbers, the Fusion sport is $40,910 (without the optional performance tires), while the Edge Sport is $38,765. So you’re paying $2000ish for a car that accelerates better, but doesn’t brake or turn better. I’m pretty sure however, the Fusion’s advantage is fleeting, as next year once the Edge ST comes out, it should at least match the Fusion Sport’s performance in every way around the same price.

So yes, I fully understand why Edge sales are soaring every year, while Fusion sales are declining (and won’t see a next generation). The Edge is just blatantly a better car in every single regard besides acceleration, where the top trim fusion that’s $2000 more expensive is better (and the upcoming Edge ST might beat). 

Now I get it, the Edge is one of the better mid-sized SUVs, while the Fusion is around the middle of the pack when it comes to midsized sedans, but I think the same conclusion is playing out in dealerships of every single brand, where the crossover is beating the sedan in either every single aspect or maybe just losing a bit when it comes to performance figures while winning significantly in practicality at around the same price or just with a small premium. 

And this is why I don’t personally lament the death of the family sedan. The average family sedan is just a meddling, mediocre product, designed to get you from A – B, while the modern crossover is a much better way to get from A – b, with more head and shoulder room, alongside better practicality at a minimal performance and fuel economy loss. 

PS: What about wagons? Well considering that the Mondeo Estate and the Fusion Sedan are the same car outside of the 5th door, all my above conclusions still hold, since although the Mondeo Estate has slightly better practicality, the Edge still easily beats it. According to Ford UK, the Edge can load 800 liters with both rows up, the Mondeo Estate can only do 525 liters with both rows up.  

**TL;DR: The Edge is better than the Fusion in interior space and practicality, while being nearly identical in size, price, handling, and fuel economy. The only place where the Fusion is better than the mechanically identical Edge is acceleration.**"	cars

Somewhere around 450-500bhp and 600Nm at the moment, and all to the front wheels.

Still I found myself quite surprised at how violent and brutal it felt like, almost like the turbo-nutters from the 80's. I know it's supposed to have Ford Revo-knuckle and some clever diff-trickery, but it was quite hard to notice since it actually felt like fighting a heavyweight boxer. Loads of fun tho. Dangerous, but fun. I guess the closer you get to the treshold of actually dying, the more alive you feel...

Only thing that I've driven that felt this fast, is a F12 Berlinetta, but in some ways this bloody hatchback felt way more violent. To quote James May: ""It's not the power, it's the nature of the delivery."""	cars

2713	When will manuals be gone?	"Ever since I was a kid I wanted a manual car, my first car was a 2012 dsg gti because the price was too good to pass up and my parents wouldnt let me get a manual. I valeted for a little bit and learned stick, the lust was becoming insatiable. Last month I bought myself a 2016 gti S 3 door w/lp,pp  that was 6 speed, every day is fun and I'm learning. 

Headlines constantly pop up which upset me but not a big deal- no coupe gtis, no base performance pack etc typical vw stuff.

But some stuck out, no more manual audis, no manual on the new GT500, hr-v losing manual, chevy cruze loses manual, even the gti is going to be dsg only in Australia.

I just wonder - how much longer until they stop producing manual transmission cars? Audi in the US fought to keep them, but sales weren't good. Theres the arguement that this is mostly for the US, but soon things might change worldwide. With Europe pushing for higher emissions standards EVs will be taking over, even in the land where manuals reign supreme. 
A shame that most people see driving as point A to point B, and not something fun, or something to get engaged in. People are too busy browsing instagram and texting to see it as anything but a car.
Its not a good feeling, when I'm older and I want a nice newer car with a third pedal, it may not be there. "	cars

When watching towards the end, the announcer talks about how putting the helical drive gear near the bottom of the differential housing allows for the hump in the floor to be removed.

I can get why the hump exists for modern compact cars, where even if it's front wheel drive it might have the exhaust pipes or transmission linkage, and why really low-riding cars would retain it, but why did so many pre-compact RWD ""boats"" a lá the Ford LTD still have the hump? Too expensive for retooling? Driveshaft bumping the road?"	cars

My OBD reader told me it was a cylinder misfire, and considering I had other stuff to fix I just cleared the check engine light and decided to fix it later, but the light didn’t come back on, so I figured it was a glitch.

That is, until I drove up to around 12,000-13,000 feet of elevation last Sunday, and it came on with the same problem. I swapped the spark plug from the problem cylinder to the neighboring cylinder so that if it comes back on, I’ll be able to tell if the spark plug was the problem based on whether the cylinder that’s misfiring changes, in the meantime, has anyone else experience these problems driving at high elevations before? Is there something else I could try?"	cars

2757	Got to drive a friend's 2017 Camaro ZL1 on track (vid link in text)	"Had the opportunity to drive a friend's 2017 Chevy Camaro ZL1 auto trans on track Sunday and I thought I'd do a little write up for anyone interested.   

First, I'd like to give a bit of driving experience background on myself, just so you know where my feedback is coming from. (If you don't GAF, just skip this paragraph).  I've been involved with track days and racing since 2003.  I've tracked several cars, including 2006 Lotus Elise, a 2003 Nissan 350Z, a 2011 Audi S4 and a 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera (current track car).  I attended Skip Barber 3 day and 2 day advanced racing schools, and raced NASA 944spec.  I've also raced karts and done a bit of autocross and rally cross.  None of this means I'm some great driver, just that I have a fair bit of experience.    

Sunday, we were at Grattan Raceway, Belding, MI, for a track day.  I couldn't resist so I asked my friend if I could drive his ZL1.  He agreed but wouldn't let me drive it with everything turned off (my normal preference), which I felt was understandable.  He said, ""it's like 90% turned off,"" or something to that effect.  I drove it in manual mode.  [Here's a vid he captured from the on-board vid system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbKVFhnq10).  What I liked about the car (in no particular order):  

* Seats.  The seats are fantastic.  Comfortable and super supportive.  Nearly as supportive as full-on race seats but 10x more comfortable.   
* Power and torque is just seemingly endless.  Very addictive.
* Handling was very good.  Fairly predictable behavior, but just not what I would call perfect.  Although I don't know how much the nannies were interfering with it.    
* Steering feel is very good for a car as heavy as this.  A bit over-boosted but still has good feel.  
* HUD is so cool.  All cars should have a HUD.  

Not so great:  

* Weight.  It drives amazing well, but you can feel that weight in the corners.  
* Throttle.  This is the thing that really detracted from the whole experience.  I could not get a feel for the throttle.  It was the most non-linear throttle I've ever experienced in a sports car.  I'd apply 50% and the response was more like 30%.  Then 60% would be 40%.  And then 70% would be 70%.   Really kind of frustrating.  Maybe it was the nannies, or the transmission or something.  

TL;DR:  Fast.  Very fast.  But the throttle needs work.  

EDIT:  It's been mentioned that the electronic aids probably used a weird (IMO) throttle mapping.  That certainly makes sense.  Maybe that's how ""normal"" people like it?  I don't know.  But it wasn't anything I would personally enjoy at any time, street or track.  "	cars

I do this because I don't want something coming up later and being used against me, and I feel it's the right thing to do.  

I find this is not a very effective strategy at getting the price I think is fair.  Although I think it should establish credibility, it tends to just create a point of leverage for buyers to use against my asking price.  Nobody I have ever met discloses like I do.

Im not sure if this the right place for this but here goes.

So last sunday morning my beloved ""Pappa-tunturi"" which is a very classic 52 year old moped here in Finland was stolen and there was a witness to the theft. Now the thief was startled by the feller who saw him and he speeded away in his car with my moped halfway stuffed in. The dude who saw them said that it looked like a two colored Mercedes or a bit older American car. What i know for sure is that it is a sedan and what the backseat looks like as the thief didn't have enough time to pack it in.So im hoping that you automotive enthusiasts could help me identify the car and help me catch the bastard who stole the apple of my eye.

2801	Passed my theory test 1st try. Here’s some last minute tips for anyone taking theirs (UK)	"So I passed my theory test first try after going in with a small level of confidence. Here’s some tips:

1. I strongly recommend the £5 app. That’s all I used as revision and as long as you’ve completed every question on the mock tests, you’re pretty much guaranteed a pass on the multiple choice question. My actual test was literally so similar to a mock on the app I couldn’t help smile to myself after the first few questions.

2. When people say most of it is common sense, it genuinely is. Loads of the questions aren’t strictly to do with driving or are so obviously stupid scenarios that it’s clear what the answer would be. I think where people go wrong is differentiating between what you actually WOULD do and what the law and the DVSA think you SHOULD do. 
 
Here’s an example: 
When can you sound your horn?
1. For fun
2. After midnight
3. To warn someone of danger
4. To let somebody know you’re waiting outside

At first glance you might choose 4 because that’s ‘what you do’ when you arrive at someone’s house, but if you think for an extra second it’s obviously to warn someone of a danger. 

3. Actually reading the question helps because there’s a few ones designed to slip you up like when they slip ‘wouldn’t’ or ‘must not’ rather than would or must in the question.

4. Chill. You have an hour to answer questions that give you the answer. Take your time.

5. Hazard perception. It’s all CGI and extremely slow compared to the real life practise clips. You’ll spot the hazards so easily, just make sure when you spot it and click, you click again a second later to make sure you get some points. Loads of people worry you can’t click loads. I clicked up to 10 times on each clip. As long as you don’t click in an obviousky cheating pattern like once every second and you don’t go stupidly over board with the amount of clicks, you’ll be gold.

2810	The Reality of Owning an Old German Super Sedan (My E55 Story)	" 

Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit! I've been lurking for a long time but finally decided to post something.

**Warning:** This is long, but I want to share as much as I can for someone looking to get into this stuff.

So we've all heard the stories on old German luxury cars. Some say they're the best things since sliced bread due to the depreciation (Tavarish), others say to avoid them like the plague (Scotty Kilmer). Personally, I think they're all right to a degree, since these cars vary so wildly in condition. If you find the right one, it can be awesome and rewarding. Get an example with 13 previous owners and a sketchy VIN history report, then yeah, you're *probably* going to have a bad time.

Around 14 months ago, I made the decision to plunge head first into the world of out-of-warranty German cruise missiles. The lease was ending on my Focus, and I had always lusted over the idea of going fast while getting my butt massaged for cheap. In retrospect, I had no business even thinking about getting an older car with high maintenance costs; the most I had ever done on a vehicle was change the oil. This was also going to be my **only** car. But I thought ""hey, all these people on the Internets are doing it, why cant I?"" So the search began.

I eventually settled on a 2003-2006 W211 chassis Mercedes E55 AMG. I chose this for a few reasons. 1) there is a *massive*community online for these things, and pretty much every problem has already been solved and documented on a forum. 2) this was one of the last ""easy"" AMG's to work on, as not many special tools are needed and most maintenance items are accessible without much hassle. And the biggest one, 3) these engines and drivetrains are known for being extremely reliable (my **only** car, remember?). There's a famous video of a 400k mile original engine E55 putting down similar power numbers to factory spec on a dyno. For really any car with that mileage, that's impressive. Oh yeah and it also had 469hp and 516 ft/lbs of torque bone stock. I was sold.

I found a fantastic example, a 2004 1-owner car with just under 100k miles. The only problem was... it was on the opposite side of the country. The car was in Seattle, I'm in Detroit. I had only ever bought one car in my life (the Focus at age 18) and had literally no idea what to do, but it looked *so damn good.* So naturally, I went to [Internet.com](https://internet.com/) and figured out what to do for buying a car site unseen. I had the dealer drive the car to a nearby Mercedes shop to have a PPI done. This is **absolutely critical** with these high-end luxury cars. You might visually see nothing wrong and have no CEL's, but there can be a whole lot wrong under the surface once the dealer-specific computers are plugged in. Everything checked out good, and once financing was set up (yes I'm young and dumb and financed an old site-unseen German car) I was ready to go.

A booked flight later and some hotels reserved (shout-out to those hotel rewards points) and I was in Seattle with my new baby. If you ever have the chance to do a cross-country road trip, **do it.** It was spectacular, especially while going through the mountains at \*insert expensive ticket here\* speeds. 2500 miles and 1 week later and I was home without the car missing a beat.

But anyways, getting to answering the question of why you're here: how much does it really cost to daily drive one of these things? Answer: **It's complicated.** Let me explain.

If you're going to directly compare this to the running costs of a similar year and mileage Corolla, it's no question; the AMG (or whatever you get) is going to be much more expensive. Go ahead, make Scotty Kilmer's day and buy the more reasonable car. There's nothing wrong with that! What Scotty won't tell you, though, is that these old super sedans *are a fucking blast.* Nothing puts a smile on your face like a ridiculously overpowered 4 door sleeper, especially when you start to realize there's not much on the road that's faster than you. Okay fine, maybe taking corners in an old Miata is more fun, but here in Michigan we don't have those things called ""corners.""

Being a person who had never really done much car maintenance/repairs before this, the E55 has been surprisingly enjoyable to work on. If you have some basic tools and a jack/jack stands, you can do most of the stuff yourself. These cars aren't that much different than anything else, and have enough room to get your hands where they need to be (unlike many modern engine bays). Parts aren't that expensive, as long as you don't pay the Mercedes tax. You can avoid this by using [www.fcpeuro.com](https://www.fcpeuro.com/) , as you can get OEM parts for a fraction of the dealer cost. The warranty is cool too. [www.mbworld.org](https://www.mbworld.org/) has lots of useful DIY's and other information, along with many other M-B specific forums. If you understand basic mechanics, you'll be fine. This car has essentially forced me to learn how to fix a car myself, as 1) it's my only car and 2) if I went to the dealership for every repair I would be living in a tent in a Detroit alley. My car would be cool though!

So onto the juicy numbers. In my exactly 1 year of ownership, I have put 27k miles on the car. My overall average MPG (60% highway 40% city) is about 17.5mpg on premium. I have been stranded 0 times (knock on lacquered interior wood trim).

And the fun stuff, the maintenance items. This is what I've done off the top of my head. Everything was done in my garage with basic hand tools and a jack with jack stands, other than the engine rear main seal since the whole trans had to be dropped.

* both motor mounts
* transmission mount
* valve cover gaskets
* breather cover RTV gaskets
* oil cooler housing seals
* heater control valve
* all brake pads and rotors (they're massive on this car, 8 piston front, 4 piston back, made by Brembo)
* crankshaft position sensor
* thrust arms (front control arms)
* lower ball joints
* outer tie rods
* stabilizer bar links
* spark plugs (takes 16!)
* intercooler water pump
* supercharger pulley belt
* alarm siren
* front wheel bearings and hubs
* alternator
* about 5 oil changes (every 5k miles)
* I also purchased an advanced MB-specific scan tool for \~$150 that allows me to read some dealer-level codes and do intermediate diagnostics.

In total, I have probably spent around $3k in maintenance on this car in my 1 year of ownership, and Lord knows how much in gas. The E55 runs great now and feels like it hasn't lost any of its 469 ponies.

Would I do it all again? *Hell yes.* I know, I know, it costs a lot to maintain and register and whatever, but this is one of those cars you can't imagine giving up. Could it just be an emotional attachment of some kind? Sure, but you forget about that every time you put your foot down. It's no Hellcat, but it's fun making Mustang owners mad when they get gapped by a 14 year old car with a mountain bike on the roof.

**TL;DR**, to conclude my ridiculously long first ever post, if you're looking to buy an old German super sedan, follow these steps:

1. Do your homework
2. Get a PPI from a dealer
3. Don't jump on the first car you see
4. Realize it's not a Corolla
5. Always keep an ""emergency fund"" for when that one expensive thing breaks
6. Wave goodbye to the Challenger SRT while your butt is being massaged... *in style*

2815	Trying to Crack the Code: More Power for the Mazda Skyactive Engines?	"I’ve read a ton of times people saying that if someone wants the Sky G 2.0 to make big-time horsepower, they’re insane. To an extent, they’re right. But, humor me just a bit in my speculation. 

The Sky-G has a weak rotating assembly and open deck block. The head and piston design has an ultra-high compression ratio and a piston cavity that was created to optimize efficiency, not horsepower. The designed focused on torque with an undersquare long stroke. Efforts to increase power result in knock and the computer cuts back on ignition timing. The Sky-G is also extremely sensitive to high temps, and there is a report of a piston exploding and taking out the two adjacent cylinders. The engine also does some weird stuff like keeping the intake valves open after the piston starts the exhaust stroke in order to “fool” the engine into thinking it has a lower compression ratio. 

So my question is, if we were able to “deactivate” the Skyactive engines, essentially turning them into square (or oversquare) 4-strokes, could they handle more power? What parts would be required to do so? How cost effective (if at all) would it be? 

This is all merely speculation, but I’d like to hear other’s thoughts and ideas on this matter. "	cars

When I open my trunk again the speakers go back to normal aside from the front 2 which always goes on and off. If I disconnect the right speaker on the rear end from my trunk the speakers work with the trunk closed. Any idea what this can be?	cars

My dad is kind of hard to buy gifts for or to surprise. So this year my mom and I pooled our resources (She funded, I did the work :P) and tried to make him something unique and special! He's always been big into cars, so we wanted to center the gift around that. 


After a lot of thinking we decided on an 'Auto-Biography' to show the history of the cars he's owned. For each car we would get an original key and make a detail tag with some details about the car. I tried to find the VIN for all of them as well, but that didn't pan out :(

2830	Opinion on swapping tires	"Hi all,

So I recently got new tires on my '11 Mazdaspeed3 from Discount Tires. I had ordered some Hankook Ventus V2 concept tires that had solid reviews, but when I showed up they said they don't have them and can't get them but will ""upgrade"" me to [Barum Bravuris](https://www.discounttiredirect.com/buy-tires/barum-bravuris-3hm/p/11423) tires instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had already paid and needed tires, so I just said okay and let them do it. I drove the tires on some mountain roads and they are okay. Better than my worn out Yokohamas, but just okay. The manager ended up calling me and saying he was very sorry, etc. and that I can swap the tires out for anything if I don't like them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't driven too many tires, so I'm not sure if I should go and try to swap. Most of the decent tires I read about are also double the cost of thes Barum's, and I dont want to be a dick and ask for super expensive tires to replace these.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone has experience with these tires compared to others, or just an opinion on what you'd do in my position.

Did you do the work yourself or did a shop do it? Would you do it again? Are you ever going to sell it? Things like that.

Personally I would love to do a build. My example would be the Alfa Romeo 159 wagon, but put in an engine that matches the looks and add a suspension lift system so it can look pretty in the parking lot or on smooth roads, but be driveable and not scraping everywhere when dailying. When I estimate costs for that though, I realise I can buy something that's better, newer, etc. and the idea dies.

2843	Why does Cadillac still fall behind MB, Audi, and BMW in the large luxury section	"If you look up the new cadillac CTS coupe, either a render or concept that unfortunately was never brought to light, you can see a serious competitor to the BMW 6 and the MB SL. In my opinion its gorgeous. 

The CT6 sedan, proposed by Cadillac to be the S-Class killer, is compared to the likes of the A6, 5 series, and E class in most motoring magazines, but not the A8, 7 series or S class. 

Ill see far more Q7's, GL's, and X5's than I would an Escalade in the wealthier parts of NJ. 

We have the Audi Prologue and E-tron, the Mercedes Maybach 6, IAA, AMG GT, and BMW's 8 series gran coupe and X7. All beautiful with obvious design elements either currently placed into their regular production cars or definitely into their future lineup. Cadillac has produced some of the most extravagant and yacht-like concepts as well, the Cadillac Escala, Elmiraj, and Ciel, all cars you'd imagine could be fighting Rolls Royce, Bentley, and Maybach. 

They know what beauty is, yet they fail with cars like the CT6 and CTS, so much anticipation of ""Finally, a Cadillac model that will bring that name back to glory"" when you saw the concept of the model, yet when put into production you walk past it and its still a bland, chunky looking Cadillac. And when compared to the A6 and A8, E and S class, 5 and 7 series, the germans can still produce a car that's crisp and stunning. 

Cadillac sells less than half the volume of its competitors. I see ugly XT5s obviously built on the chevy equinox platform, fat XTS's, small unattractive base model ATS's, no CTS or CTS-V's, no CT6. Why is it that Cadillac underperforms, are they not capable, restricted by GM, underfunded or ill-equipped? Does their design department not care about their production cars as much as the concepts, or are they maybe two completely separated departments? 

They were once the car to envy and be sought after, something to work hard for. It's disappointing to see its concepts never come to fruition, especially when the word Cadillac now brings you the image of an 2001 deville in beat up, stained and dented instead of a pristine 1980's coupe deville in black rolling down the road glimmering with fresh wax and chrome.

2853	Welcome to the Salt Belt; my 2002 Explorer had a Class 1 hitch that was rotten through, heres how I upgraded it to a Class 3 for $25.	"More from the chronicles of projeckt Fr0d Expl0der!

On this wonderful 89 degree Michigan Summer day, I decided it was the perfect day to not only sweat out all of my fears and potentially die of dehydration, but also to solve a glaring issue that my cheap tow truck was suffering from.

It can't tow.

Why? because the trailer hitch is [*dangerously* rotten.](https://imgur.com/wSpbGuf) I can literally put my finger through it in multiple places. So what do we do? Well, my original solution was to order an upgraded Class 3 hitch from the likes of Uhaul, Curt, or Hidden Hitch. After reviewing the options and finding that all of them were hideously expensive ($150-$200) and none of them would go in place of the disgusting factory hitch that had experienced weight reduction by rust, I decided I wanted a factory hitch from a Mountaineer or a V8 Explorer. 

OFF TO THE DEALER I GO! 

After a brief (and I mean *brief*) visit to a local Ford Dealership on the east side of Detroit, I found 2 things. 1) good luck finding a new one, and 2) its likely going to be over $300 to find a new old stock factory Class 3 hitch. Fat chance; there is no way I am spending over 1/3rd of the cost of the vehicle on a trailer hitch so I can tow something behind this truck, explode the transmission, and cry until I feel better... (Homer Simpson voice) mmm expensive tears...

So, what do? WELP! Time to bust out the Home Depot/Husky Mechanics tool set, and make the long trek to 8 Mile road in the D (thats Detroit... We call Detroit ""the D"", I know... its terrible). This isn't a plug, but my favorite junk yard is Parts Galore, they have multiple locations around Detroit Metro but by far the best one is off of 8 Mile and Groesbeck Highway (M-97). It costs $1 to get in, and they have *tons* of vehicles to pick from, they also do a stellar job of updating their inventory right on the website, when I checked they said they had 8 Ford Explorer/Mountaineers between 2002-2007 in the yard, and they were 100% correct, and every one of them was within a city block of each other, which made it extremely easy to locate what I was looking for.

The first hitch I found happened to be just as rotten as the one on my truck, but a quick 180 degree turn and I find another 2002 Ford Explorer with a *mint* and completely rust free Class 3 hitch with 6 prong electrical connector and wiring harness/cover that was complete and undamaged, SCORE. 

Removal was easy...ish. the bolts were 15mm on the junk yard truck, but having no access to pneumatic tools, and forgetting my breaker bar, I was limited to the tools I could bring and whatever I could find in the junkyard. The bolts were *tight*, supremely tight. My 1/2 Inch Husky ratchet just didn't have the leverage to break it free, laying underneath this explorer happened to be a short length of 2.5 inch exhaust pipe, so, [I helped myself to a free breaker bar](https://imgur.com/bi4BOvo).

Within minutes the spectacular class 3 hitch was free from its grave yard mountings, ready for a new lease on life on another rusty piece of junk, a quick scour around the donor vehicle and a I find a window trim that I also needed for my truck.

I approach the Cashier with my prize, dumping it onto the counter and leaving a happy little customization (dent) in the steel that it was made out of. The Cashier looked at my, curious, ""what is that?"" she asked me, curious about what I had just discovered during my archaeological dig.   

""its a tail light bulb"" I said with a stupid grin on my face.

The cashier laughed, knowing I was trying to pull a fast one on her, since tail light bulbs are $2 there. 

""really, what is it?"" she asked. I answered honestly (having already looked at he prices for the parts on their website) ""its a Hitch receiver."" 

""AH! thats $25 with a $6 core, cash or card?"" I happily gave her my credit card, she rang me up and threw in the window trim for free.

Time to install; removal of the rear bumper revealed the severity of the condition, I was actually stunned to find that [this had supported my weight in the past](https://imgur.com/gmazK9Z). It was [*bad*](https://imgur.com/O7m5GHO). Welp! out with the old and [in with the new](https://imgur.com/FKPQJC2). 

Even before the bumper was fitted the hitch looked 1000 times better, no pictured here I did happen to undercoat the new hitch, everywhere but the exposed areas, I wanted it to look stock still but be protected from the elements, and [here it is all done!](https://imgur.com/C2gU9Xu)

After this whole ordeal I had 2 hours of my time and $25 of cash invested into the upgrade, and now I have a truck that is capable of towing at its full capacity (5000 pounds) rather than the 0 pounds that the dangerous factory hitch was offering, I was impressed to even find that the factory wiring was compatible with the upgraded hitch and 6 plug RV connector which supports electric brakes that are built into the trailer. Definite win for the day, and the holiday weekend, the next big fix for this truck before winter hits is getting the 4 wheel drive working again, with a surprisingly inexpensive fix.

Until next time! 


**TL;DR - I bought a replacement hitch for my Explorer, it was $25, stop being lazy and read the rest.** "	cars

I moved from Texas to NY a couple months ago, pulling about 1,000 lbs. The transmission fluid did not need to be flushed at that time, but I was advised to flush it after the move.

2861	Just saw first Alfa Romeo Stelvio, why did it have black smoke coming from the exhaust?	"I was walking my dog and a Stelvio rolls by, this is a flat section of the neighborhood and they were going 25 mph (40 Kph) at most so not giving any throttle really. As it went by I noticed black smoke coming from the exhaust, worse than I see when cars from the 70s go by, and nearly as bad as a two-stroke! I wonder if there was a misfire or something, I thought the engine sounded strange, but at such low speed I could hardly hear the engine idling down the road. This isn't just water vapor, as it was a sunny 90F (32C) day at the time. 

How can such a new vehicle, with such strict modern environmental regulations, smoke that bad? Is it supposed to do this? I have a hard time understanding why VW got so much attention when this gasoline Alfa smokes worse than any VW diesel I've ever seen. If it is intentionally designed I am not sure how it can pass any emissions testing. Or is the FCA build quality that bad that a two-year-old max luxury vehicle could have engine troubles so soon into ownership?"	cars

2867	I seriously need some help eliminating rattles in my exhaust. 2017 Subaru WRX	Before I post this, I have already submitted a post to /r/WRX for help and they gave me virtually no advice so I'm coming here to /r/cars since this isn't a WRX specific issue. Just over half a year ago, I got a catless jpipe installed which came with a mid pipe and had the rest custom fabricated. Bolts that held the midpipe and rest of the exhaust together rattled out so I had all the sound coming out from beneath the car. I ordered a new flat flange, screwed some locknuts onto the new bolts to ensure they didn't rattle out again and figured that was it. Well, something is still rattling. It only happens when I'm accelerating. Not at neutral and not revving it at neutral. It rattles during decel as well. I want to say the flat flange in between the two pipes is what's rattling but it was perfectly flush and I used a torque wrench to bolt the pipes together until I couldn't turn it anymore. Those pipes are bolted together extremely tightly but something is still rattling. Given that it only rattles when I drive, I can't really pinpoint what's rattling. It's kind of hard to investigate a strange sound from the undercarriage when the vehicle is moving. Anyone have any idea what might be causing the rattle? It doesn't sound or smell like there's an exhaust leak and I haven't gotten any CEL or anything like that so I'm beyond confused. 	cars

2871	Of the sedans of the 2000s, which would have looked better / equally as good in coupe form?	"Having seen an [Infiniti G37 Coupe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg/180px-2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg) the other week, this had me thinking about which sedans [that didn't offer a coupe option] would have looked just as good, or better in coupe form.

For me, I'd have probably liked to have seen a coupe version of:

**Hyundai Sonata NF (2004-2009)** [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/06-08_Hyundai_Sonata.jpg). If it was a coupe, I expect Hyundai would have sold it only with the 3.3-liter/237hp V6, and only in CDX [ (later CDX+ trim level ], or for the U.S. and Canada, Limited spec. The 2004-2010 Sonata looked good for a mid-size sedan.

**Mazda 6 (2007-2012)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg/420px-Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg). OK, so there hasn't been a 626 Coupe for years, but the Mazda 6's fluid lines would adapt well to a coupe model. If there was a coupe model, it would probably have been available in Touring and Grand Touring spec, with the 3.7-liter/272hp V6 petrol.

**Ford Falcon BA (2002-2005)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg/300px-2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg). This one is one of my favorite generations of this classic Australian sedan. If there was a coupe, I expect it'd have a choice of three versions - XR6 with the 4.0-liter/244hp 6-cylinder, XR6 Turbo with the 4.0-liter/320hp 6-cylinder turbo and XR8 with the 5.0-liter/350hp V8 Boss 260 engine.

Although, saying that, I actually got my wish to have this version, in a way, as [Australian company Dreamtech built one](https://www.qt.com.au/news/the-coupe-ford-never-built/707321/) with the 5.4-liter/350hp V8 Boss 350 engine and a supercharger. It looks so awesome, I like this one.

**Subaru Legacy BL/BP (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg/1920px-Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg). I already like this sedan and stationwagon anyway, but imagine there being a 2.0-liter/279hp twin-scroll turbo model in GT Spec B version as a sporty coupe. I know there was the Impreza STi in coupe form, but this... it could have been pretty good!

**Audi A8 D3 (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg/420px-2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg). I've always liked the A8, one of the most stately and impressive full-size sedans.

If there was a coupe, I expect it'd be a quattro model with a choice of the 4.2-liter/335hp V8 [ (later the 4.2-liter/345hp V8) ] and the 5.2-liter/444hp V10 FSI engines for the S8 model.

There actually *was* an Audi A8 coupe, [as this article from motorauthority.com shows](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1111462_meet-the-audi-a8-coupe-you-didnt-know-existed), but that was based on the first-generation D2 model, and was from 21 years ago.

Imagine the Audi S8 as a trackday coupe - good idea or bad idea?

2888	How to bluff convincingly about virtually any car	"I'm interested in the ""bluffer's line"" for your car: essentially, something that only people who have owned the car for many years, or pushed it frequently to its limits, or hung around for too long in its subcultures, would know about.

I'll start with my mini-stable:

CLS63 AMG (W218): It really needs the limited-slip diff and it is baffling why AMG did not make this standard equipment. It was only available as an option in the ""S"" version, and Merc will not retroactively fit one to standard 63s. Quaife offer an aftermarket diff that is highly rated in the community.

TVR Cerbera: If the handbrake is too weak, seven times out of ten, it's because you're too weak. The [bizarre layout of the cabin](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2000-TVR-Cerbera-Pictures-c10970?picturesTabFilter=INTERIOR) means that the handbrake is almost at shoulder level, and very difficult to get a good pull on.

2889	Analyst/Nerd Appeal to EV Owners	"This is not any kind of EVangelist promotion. I own a first-generation EV without the capability I am about to mention. (I also own a gas-powered SUV and a diesel truck.) The tl;dr version is that I'm looking for someone with a newer-generation EV who also has a meter at his 240v plug, so we can determine how much electricity is lost when the car is being charged.

**The long version**

The newer EVs have screens that, among other things, will tell you how much electricity you used to go X distance. They will give you fuel economy numbers, typically expressed in miles/kWh and sometimes in equivalent miles per gallon, a/k/a mpg-e.

The problem with these displays is that they omit the considerable EV charging losses. I have seen charging loss estimates ranging from 15% to 25%. So, when I'm doing various analyses, I will use 20% as the charging loss number, but I'm not confident of it. The only way to really know would be to spend \~$100 on an EKM Metering meter, placed right smack next to your 240v plug. This would tell you how much juice you used between charges. Compare that to what your in-car display says, and *voila!* you would have the charging loss. Oh, and you'd have the actu*al electricity use, which you can use to find your EV'*s true fuel economy.

I like my little 2011 Think City battery operated grocery getter, but I regard it as a car and not a cause. And it lacks an onboard fuel economy readout. If I want to know its true electricity consumption and fuel economy (and I do!), then I *must* have a meter next to the plug. I always want the real numbers, and always tell everyone else the good, the bad, and the ugly. So: Are there any EV owners here who measure their car's consumption at the plug with a meter? (Incidentally, this is how the EPA does it when calculating EV fuel economy.) If so, I am *very interested* in working with you to determine the charging loss.

Thanks much. Apologies in advance to those for whom this is pathetically OCD. Hey, folks, once an analyst always an analyst. It's what we are."	cars

2896	Does anyone elses enjoyment of driving get diminished by having to commute to and from work through heavy traffic everyday?	"When I bought my Celica about a year ago I worked at a local company which I could easily reach by public transport and I didnt have to rely on my car. Back then I had immense fun driving since I could chose when and where to drive on my own terms. Most of my kilometers on the odometer back then were from nightly joyrides on the Autobahn or through curvy backroads with no other cars in sight, just me and my machine.

About two months ago I had to switch jobs and got a new job in a different town about 40 kilometers from where I live which is difficult to reach by public transport, so for the first time I had to rely on my car to get me to and from work every day. To make matters worse there is currently a ton of roadwork on the Autobahn which I have to use every day, which means at least one of three lanes is blocked, so most of my time is spent creeping at 30 kph behind trucks. I need about an hour for those 40 km, which should tell you about the speed I can go at.

This all but has completely killed my enjoyment of driving. Instead of sitting down behind the wheel with a smile on my face as I turn on my car I loathe having to take that commute everyday. Not to mention having to pay super close attention to fuel economy and probably having my rates raise up from increased km/year.

Maybe this is just a whiny rant, but does anyone else feel that way? Right now I feel like I'd rather go back to public transport, even if it would take me longer than being stuck in traffic.

Does driving need to be enjoyable?"	cars
2897	Girlfriend Lost Control and Wrecked ‘13 TSX Trying to Avoid a Deer. Totaled??	"Driving my car down the parkway to get to work around 7:00 this morning my girlfriend had a deer run out in front of her. She tried swerving to avoid it, looks like she couldn’t stop the understeer and went full General Lee flying over a roughly 10’ grass ramp acting as the median right into the other side of traffic. Thankfully it was early and there was no oncoming traffic but she got a lot of air and came down hard. Steering wheel and passengers side curtain airbags deployed. She’s okay albeit pretty bruised and will be sore for a while, definitely the best possible outcome safety wise. (Picture below of the sick Acura logo brand she got when the airbag deployed) 

[Acura Brand As Promised](http://cubeupload.com/im/Hubersglutes/1C81EF4D2D4E44628A6A.jpeg) 

I haven’t been able to look at the car yet as the tow yard is closed for Labor Day but have seen the pics she sent me. Will go on Tuesday with the appraiser. Front and rear bumpers both damaged, rear drivers side tire blew, bent rim, maybe brake damage. Several scuffs and scrapes around the entire vehicle. Since I haven’t gotten to see it I’m assuming the worst so far as the suspension etc. 

Cars worth around 12K. My research is saying the airbags alone could be almost half of that. I think KY requires 75% of value in damages to total a vehicle. I’m thinking it’ll be totaled. What do you guys think? 

Also side note: I never realized how little I could care about damage to the car just knowing she’s safe. Like holy shit this could’ve been sooo much worse.

The tires are however 5 years old and show some cracking on the inside but I am unsure if there's any issues/cracking at the side wall.
Here are some pics
https://imgur.com/a/WyIoq2F

I believe the previous owner of the car put ~5000 miles on them and I put maybe ~10000 or less over 18 months (I ran chinese Milestar tires in the winter but then blew a sidewall in a giant pot hole)

I realize the tires are old and I do plan on replacing them especially before the winter comes (I live in the midwest). I'd prefer to go with name brand all season tires and ~$400-$500 installed if possible. I drive 5000-10000/year or less (mostly highway 55-75 mph)

My local discount tire has some cheap no name brand tires on their website which I don't trust but when I went to the physical store they tried to sell me some $700 continentals. Since I don't drive much ( I may drive less than 5000 miles on certain years if I end up relocating ) what are some good options for me? Rebates, etc. Should I replace only the front tires since the rear still have plenty of tread?

2904	2018 Chevrolet Malibu Premier Review: Better than an Audi?	"So a few days ago, I was really bored, and after reading a bunch of media reviews of the new Chevrolet Malibu, I decided to go check one out. I was at my local ford dealer getting an oil change, and well, I decided to pop over next door to see what the Chevrolet dealer had, and after chatting a bit with the salesman, and saying that I want something ""sportier but 4 door"", the guy pulled up a loaded Malibu and told me to get in.

So the car I'm talking about is loaded, with a canada exclusive ""Premier True North Edition"", with all the driver assistance tech and 19 inch wheels. Sticker price was $37 thousand (CAD) and change, but after factory incentives and adding AC tax and destination the car was around 34 thousand and change (building an identical car on the chevy website got me $34,700)

So the Malibu I sat in was black exterior, black interior, and black bowtie, essentially everything that could be black was black. The premier trim gets you LED DRLs, and LED tail lights. I hate black cars, but putting that aside, I have to say, the Malibu is a bit of a butterface. The front isn't great, but the side profile and rear is pretty handsome, and the sloping, coupe like roofline does look pretty good. But the front, ugh, the split grille isn't to my liking, and even in the top trim, the non-drl lights are still halogen and not LED, kinda disappointing for a loaded car in 2018 (especially since the tail is full LED).

On the inside, the black interior color probably hides a lot of the cheaper materials used, but it looks totally fine. The seats could be a little bit softer, and there's some weird wood trim on the door and around the shifter, but the materials used is mostly OK. The mirrors auto dim, and are heated, but unfortunately, the rear view mirrors don't fold electronically I believe. The steering wheel feels nice and meaty, but I don't particularly like the membrane buttons. The air vents are angled weirdly, but you can still get the air to blow at your face. Heated and vented front seats complete the package, and were much appreciated during the test drive. 

The infotainment is nice, smooth, and fast. The screen is pretty bright, and from my experience with a few FM stations, the audio is more than competent. You get 4G LTE, alongside carplay and android auto, there's also a wireless charging pad that I really like. 

On the road, the Malibu is surprisingly good. The chassis is brilliant, as the car really handles like it is a few hundred pounds lighter than you expect (apparently, depending on config, the Malibu starts at 3,084, which is much lighter than the competition). The suspension is a weakpoint, as it does mildly dive a bit when you push it and there is a bit of body roll. The salesman did mention that Chevy offers a factory upgraded suspension, which according to the website actually lowers your car (aside: factory slammed Malibus are a thing now?). Steering is acceptable, the ratio is quick enough, and the power steering is boosted to an acceptable, but not overboosted level. There is some torque steer if you floor the car, but not really if you're really gentle with the throttle. 

The drivetrain is above average for its class for sure. The GM turbo 4 is a very good engine, torque hits you like a wall. Lag is a bit more noticable than ford Ecoboosts, but I have a feeling it would be better on premium gas. The engine is for the most part quiet, no perceivable engine vibration could be felt in the seats and the broad torque curve was pretty damned nice for day to day driving. Transmission wise, the transmission for the most part shifts smooth, but the new 9 speed could use a bit of tuning maybe, on low speed city roads it hunts for gears occasionally. 

Overall, the Malibu is more than OK, and for 34 thousand ish canadian bucks. As a comfortable, daily, family sedan, Malibus are a good option despite some of my nitpicks (Halogen headlights, bad front end design, odd interior design). 

Is it better than an Audi though? Hmm, well, I think its better than the Fusion, Altima, Mazda 6, and Camry for sure. Maybe the Accord is better? hard to say without more driving. But price for price, I'd 100% take the Malibu before I take the similarly priced FWD A3, and I'd prefer the malibu even to the FWD a4 that's $5000 more. 

I do feel that GM could potentially have a home run in their hands if they bring back the Malibu SS. Up the power a bit to ~270 hp like in the Camaro, add in Buick's Hi-per-strut, maybe add an AWD system, and Chevrolet might actually have a hit on their hands. The chassis is actually quite good, after all, the Malibu is a midsized that weights like a compact, its even ~400lbs lighter than a FWD A4 while being a whole size class up!

Does anyone have any idea if there is the possibility of a software update to enable the functionality as it seems that the hardware is already there.

2912	Why do people hate the Honda Ridgeline?	"To be clear: I know a lot of people / car magazines love the truck, and I personally don’t own one.

That said, it seems like there are a notable amount of people that are severely angered by the fact that the Ridgeline is unibody and FWD-based. Why?

I mean, it’ll do all of the light-duty truck stuff (tow 5,000 pounds, haul 1,600 pounds in the bed, and do mild off-roading if one is so inclined) and, having sat in one, appears to work pretty well as a daily driver.

2918	My (not so) new 1998 Dodge Neon Coupe	"http://imgur.com/j0Tml3i

Some bad news. My 1997 Tercel is no more. The underbody was too rusted to be saved (my Camry is getting rust-proofed this fall for sure just in case). So with no shitbox to beat on, I decided to trade up (or down to some of you). 

I mentioned in a thread a couple days ago that the 1st gen Neon is a car that I've always had a soft spot for on top of my already strong attraction to old econoboxes. So I bought this at an auction a few hours ago for $225. It has only 68,000 miles and I'm only the 2nd owner. The previous one donated it about a month ago. I'm sure you're curious why. Everything works....except for the shift linkage. Gonna replace that and use this as one of my beaters. 

I might do some light mods for autocross, but I'm not gonna change much. I just feel so glad to finally have one after a year of searching."	cars

2922	Questioning my ability to drive my car these days (RPM hang).	"I won't lie, I'm a bit reluctant to post this due to how judgmental most people tend to be...We'll see how this goes.

​

As the title states, I'm starting to question my ability to drive my car. This could possibly entirely all in my head. I drive a 2018 WRX MT (duh). As a lot of manual drivers know, modern cars have RPM hang. I generally shift around 3k RPM because I don't see a reason to drive faster. However, if I shift from say 2 to 3rd (or 3 to 4, 4th to 5th is VERY noticable), I can tell I'm generally shifting too fast as my RPMs drop when I release the clutch. It's not a jerky feeling, it's actually REALLY smooth. It's just that 600-800RPM difference I assume is putting stress on the flywheel as the speed of the engine and road are differential? On the flipside, if I wait a bit...the RPMs jump up a bit (200-400 RPM) because I'm waiting too long. I release the clutch slowly and don't dump it.

I know most younger drivers can careless about improving their ability, but I am not one. I want my car to last and I want to be able to pass on good traits.

I would GREATLY appreciate any input to improve. I've been told to shift at higher RPMs but that just seems to lead to needing to wait more...Thanks"	cars

2928	My car keeps getting a notification that says “low oil pressure engine off”.	I keep getting the notification every time I’m driving. I recently just got a used engine for my 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan since my old one broke down. As I got my car back the repair shop, I was driving for like 10 minutes, then I started getting the notification. I went back to the repair shop, and they said the sensor could’ve been bad so they replaced it. A few days after the problem, I got the notification again but only for a few seconds. I just ignored thinking it was just the sensor. A few weeks go by, and it happens again. I go back the repair shop and they check the engine. They said the engines fine and they change the sensor again. Now a hour ago as I was driving to my aunts house, I got the low oil pressure notification but again, it only goes on for 5 seconds so I just ignore. As I was driving him though, I got the notification but it was going on for at least 20 seconds. I stop the car and turn off the engine. I waited for a few minutes then started the car. A few minutes later it started giving me the notification again. At this point, I’m not sure whether it’s actually the sensor or something else. Can someone help me?	cars

Some extra notes that may help:

I didn’t fully turn the key off until I pulled it out.  (now that I think about it could have solved the problem. I used to ride a motorcycle so I assumed it would just turn right back on.)

I was able to recreate the problem one other time. (I eventually got the hang of it.)

I assumed it may be an unsafe (in heavy traffic) safety feature presumably to keep you from accidentally turning the engine over while it’s already running. (Assuming of course it doesn’t keep track of whether the engine is on or off.)

2940	Doors falling off 1996 Dodge Dakota (Help Question)	"Hello friends I have a bit of an odd question for a problem I have never encountered in any older model truck before. 

I own a 96 Dodge Dakota.  Perfect condition, runs great, I love my little truck.  Since buying the truck both doors, driver and passenger have broken in the same way and I'm curious if anyone knows a solution to this problem or has encountered it before.

On both doors, the bottom hinge of the door has broken completely through the frame of the door.  When you close the door, the hinge doesn't rotate anymore it literally just pushes itself -into- the frame of the door where it has broken a hole around it.  

On the drivers door I tried to have a mechanic weld it, and he did a shit job and burned a hole through the door and turned the hinge into slag.  That one I've resigned myself to simply replacing the entire door with one from a salvage yard (If I can ever find one).  

The Passenger side door is only slightly damage at this time and I'm curious if anyone has ever encountered this type of failure before that might have some solutions on how to fix it?  Or how to prevent it from happening again when I get a new door to install.  "	cars

Anyway, I have been driving this car for college and I've noticed a few things weird with the car. For one, it vibrates when I go over 63~ mph, and the vibration gets stronger the faster I go. Like, my body goes up and down, the steering wheel sorta shakes, etc. 

Second, it takes a little too long to switch gears, and when it does, it gives off a tiny but noticeable jerk. I wait like 1-2 seconds for the tranny to switch from reverse to drive, etc. 

Third, sometimes, the Juke is too slow to accelerate. I'm in stop and go traffic, and sometimes the car  just feels much slower than usual, despite the normal revving noise I'd expect when accelerating in S&amp;G traffic. Could it be because I decided to fill the car with premium once and went back to regular?

Also, the fuel mileage is pretty bad. I got about 22-23 mpg on mixed SG and highway driving. Could it also be because I mixed premium with regular? I don't believe I drive like a maniac, like, I don't accelerate harder than cars around me, and if there are no cars around me, I sometimes let go of the pedal so that I won't have to use the brakes as much.

2957	Mustang for Fiesta ST...now I get it	"Hi everyone! After being on the fence about trading in my 2011 Mustang for a semi-hot hatch, I finally took the plunge. 

I was looking at the used market for the Focus ST, MK7 GTI, and Fiesta ST. I looked the idea of the GTI but future maintenance scared me away. The used market for the Focus ST was a little too high and then I found a certified pre-owned Fiesta ST with every option available for under 15k and I took that as a sign from the universe. 

My mustang was only a V6 but it was optioned exactly like I wanted: Premium Leather, performance package and glass roof (pretty rare). It was tough to move on from the Mustang but I needed a little more usable space (no kids but 2 pets). The dealer tried to low ball me on the trade initially for 7k and we eventually got to a number I was comfortable. We ended up on 9.5k plus I would save 500 in taxes; blue book had the Mustang from 10-11k and my car was very clean with be tires and brakes all around. Unfortunately, it had bubbling paint on the hood which the S197 generation is notorious for and they stuck to giving me a little less the excellent trade in value. 

Long story short, the moment I drove the Fiesta ST, I was hooked. It just felt right. The Mustang always felt bigger than it needed to be while the Fiesta ST's proportions felt balanced. I'm not the biggest guy (5'8) and the Recaros hugged me just right. On the highway, I could pass while in 6th gear while the Mustang would struggle in 5th gear and forget about 6th gear. 

The Fiesta felt like the iconic cars from the 90's that I grew up idolizing. Let this be advice for anyone looking to get into a hot hatch: You don't need the biggest or fastest to have fun!"	cars

2969	Upgraded my daily driver this week. I’m excited to see what torque feels like!	"After owning a 2017 BRZ for almost two years, I thought it was still the perfect car for me. I modified it for track duty (header, tires, brakes, coils,etc) and it was still totally compliant for daily use. I saw a used ISF go up for sale at a local dealer and I was always curious how they drove. With no intentions to buy one, I took it for a spin and was instantly hooked. It was very comfortable, great handling, and the motor is so smooth and sounds godly when the intake flap opens. This always sat in the back of my mind and I told myself whenever I needed to upsize to 4 doors, the ISF will be my car of choice. 

Well, the time has come where I need more room and I can’t say I’m disappointed! I’ll definitely miss the BRZ since it was so well balanced and very lightweight. It taught me how to drive on the track and never had issues. Although, the ISF is in another level in terms of speed and comfort. I found this 2009 ISF with 80k miles in California and had it shipped over to Arizona as there was not one for sale here in decent shape. No rust, no accidents, and in very good shape. Hopefully I will take this to an HPDE event once or twice over the winter to see its capabilities until I have room for a track dedicated car.

2974	Fixing issues as soon as they appear vs. waiting until they get serious?	"So I recently got into an argument with my mother and her fiancé about how to treat minor issues with a car which could become troublesome later down the line.

I own a 203.000 km Toyota Celica and it is starting to show its age. Recently, the transmission has started whining around certain speeds (around 50-70 kph), indicative of differential pinion gear wear. It might also leak a little bit of oil and the dampers are slowly losing their power, making the ride even less comfortable than it already was. Also the chassis in general is starting to get creaky and I am sure the clutch release bearing is starting to wear down as well, as there is a rattling noise whenever I engine-brake.

Now I showed all those issues to the fiancé of my mother, who has driven everything from tiny subcompacts over big trucks to even a tank in his life and he told me to stop worrying. All those things are simply indicative of an old car and should not concern me yet, it will still run for another 50.000 km at least and until then I will have found a new car.

My mother owns a 198.000 km VW Lupo (a city car with 50 HP for those unaware because I dont think its being sold in murica) and its an absolute shitbox. Whenever I drive it (rarely) I feel like it could fall apart at any moment. The clutch is super fucked, the shifter is the most wobbly thing in the world and the transmission and suspension rattles to hell and back. But my mother doesnt care. She only drives it for about 12 km a day from work and back and to the grocery store every week and it has yet to fail her. 

Both of them tell me to not worry so much about my car and that if I would give in to my worries every time I would probably visit the mechanic every single month, but I just want my car to last as long as possible and feel great driving it.

""She's a great project (and daily!), and she was saved after being caught in the Hurricane Harvey floods. I guarantee you that my Lotus Esprit is the only one to have actually pulled a James Bond and gone under water (and lived!) :) Thankfully it got flooded with fresh water when the battery was disconnected, so the electrical gremlins are not really present. New carpet, new fluids, clean tanks, a tune, and more have really brought this car back to life. Next I am repainting it and installing some coilovers I received recently! I love this damn thing, and it's fun to see people's reaction when I tell them that it was up to the roof in water lol.""

I see 15-20 year old flagships like the 7 series and S class for less than $10k, sometimes even $5k on used car sites. Maintenance and repairs aside, how do these cars compare to modern luxury as well as modern economy cars in comfort, noise, ride quality, interiors etc?"	cars

"You see people foaming at the bit to get Teslas, but there isn't really anything special about how to build a Tesla (bar maybe the autonomous driving stuff) and those type of electric motors are available to every car manufacturer. 

Its just amazing to me that the other manufacturers haven't started to mass produce desirable electric cars. The efforts they make seem more orientated as an electric option of a traditional car and lack any semblance of styling and performance. I highly doubt Toyota or GM would have the production and quality struggles Tesla has, they know how to manufacturer a car plant."	cars

&amp;#x200B;

Literally nearly every car journalist and review has complained about the engine and it's lack of power. I'm sure they are more than well aware that their market wants a more powerful version of the car. Yet Subaru releases the BRZ tS, in which they improved nearly every other performance attribute, except for the engine, which is by far the most complained about, most lacking and underwhelming aspect of the car? They're not dumb. They know that the engine is the worst part about the car. They know that this is what the consumers want. Common business sense would be release a more powerful version of the car. Yet it's been 6 years and they have stubbornly refused to and I can't figure out their reasoning. Why are they doing this?"	cars

I found a deal on some Mobile 1 High Mileage 5 qt synthetic 5-W30 oil and a Mobile 1 oil filter.  Well I was reading more and saw here and there that its recommended to change the drain plug gasket with every or every other oil change.  I've never heard of this.  Should I be doing this?  Also, when looking at my manual for my car it mentions I need to use   oil meeting GM standard GM6094M.  I also didnt know about this.  My vehicle is a 2006 Pontiac Torrent.  Is this an outdated standard and should I be following it?  I looked up on Mobile's website and it says I should use a different oil to meet that standard.  I thought all I needed to look for was 5-W30 oil.  Am I way over-complicating this?  After all, its been getting 12 years of crappy oil at quick lube shops this whole time and all they have only ever mentioned was 5-W30 oil.  What are your thoughts?

Edit:  Should I be using Mobile 1 Extended Performance full synthetic oil since its supposed to be guaranteed for 1 year or 15,000 miles whichever comes first?  This oil is available on a similar deal and is only about $5 more and should theoretically last me a year instead of 6 months with what I have.  That oil does make the GM6094M spec.  I do have an engine oil life indicator on the dash that will light up when its time to change the oil.  Should I just follow that light for when to change the oil again?"	cars

Obviously I guess parking spaces have also adapted to the growth of cars. Personally, I tend to drive older cars. As such, sometimes I'll run into a compact car spot (often times they're situated in a way that you only have one car next to you or none, like there's protective barriers between spaces, so they're quite nice), snugly fit my car in the space, and smile.

3030	I need advice on what you do when a dealership has scammed me.	"I purchased a Dodge Dart 2016 about a week ago from a used car dealership. I did a test drive, everything was fine with the carfax, 2 previous owners. 2nd owner had it for 6 months, which I thought was odd, but people trade in cars all the time. 

Day 1 of having it for a couple of hours, after getting home the car failed to start when I tried to go to the store. I thought that was fine, I'd just notify the dealership and they'll fix it, engine light came on the second day. I went back to the dealership on Saturday for them to fix whatever was wrong with the car, and for them to finish the detail. I was there for 2 hours, and after handing me back my keys, I ask why the engine light came on, and the guy said 'something with the oil,' and that was that. 

I went on a trip with my sisters on Saturday. We just traveled an hour and 20 minutes away to go to an event. Half way through the event I decided to go buy snacks for all of us, but when I got into the car, it wouldn't start again. I tried about 2 more times until it finally started, but the car vibrated really hard and the engine light came back on. 

I made it to Target to get the snacks and when I got back to the car, and started it up, the engine began overheating, the battery light came on and the car died. So sat there for a while, a couple of people asked if I needed a jump, but I didn't accept any help, I didn't think it was the battery and I honestly didn't know what to do when an engine overheats, no car I've never had ever overheated.  I called my mom to come pick us up, since I didn't want to start the car up again, and risk damaging anything. The hood of the car was up the entire time I was sitting at target, the temperature that day was over 100 degrees. About 20 minutes later I went to see if the engine was still over heating after reading a couple or articles about overheating Dodge Dart 16s. 

It took a couple of times to get it to start, it was still overheating, but not as bad, it wasn't going above the red line. I made my way to an AutoZone that was down the street and asked for the engine light check.

I explained my situation to the guy and he told me I should bring the car back. (I already tried, salesman said no) The AutoZone guy, David, said I needed new spark plugs, which is why it isn't starting on the first try. He said that I wouldn't need new spark plugs until about 750000 miles, and I was only at 33000. 

He went ahead and checked to coolant for me after I told him about the overheating, and there was very little coolant in the car, he couldn't even see any. So I went ahead a purchased coolant, and he put it in for me. 

My mom finally made it to us, and we debated leaving the car there to be towed, but ultimately decided against it since the car was no longer overheating.

We made it about 10 minutes from home before the car died again at a red light. I pressed the gas to go, and realized the the cars engine wasn't running. A guy stopped to help us out, and checked to oil. There was no oil. He got us home, and told us to look into the lemon law. I'm in Texas. 

We notified the salesman the next day, and that's when he said that the car can't be returned, and that we have to bring the car to a Dodge dealership, since it's still under warranty. 4 days later Dodge says that the car has been in an obvious wreck and was fixed without it showing up on the carfax. They obviously did a horrible job, and the engine was damaged in the wreck, and possibly not covered under warranty, since the repairs that were done could have contributed to the engine damage. 

I just left the carsalesman and he said his boss is going to talk to the Dodge dealership, because they have to fix it under warranty. 

I do not want the car anymore, I just wanna return it. The salesman lied to me, not only about the obvious wreck damage, but about the mpg the car gets and about it having navigation. 

I'm in Texas, I wanna know my options, thanks for reading. 

Edit: I was at the dealership the day before I went on my trip, and they failed to add oil and coolant to the car. Despite telling me that the engine light was on because of a 'oil problem.'"	cars
3031	A question about tire size for my car (AKA, I goofed and am wondering if its salvageable)	"My oem wheels are 16X6.5
My normal (and officially correct) tire size is 205/55/R16

Bought some snow tires (craigslist) to swap in for winter, and somehow bought 205/65/R16 I don't know how I missed that they are 205/65, but I have them now.

My understanding of the math involved:
205 * .55 = ~112.75mm sidewall height
205 * .65 = ~133.25mm sidewall height

The difference is only 20.5mm, and here my understanding gets fuzzy. Does that mean my overall diameter got 20.5 mm greater, or 41mm greater. And either way, are those too big of increases to use?

The car in question is a 2005 VW beetle.

Aside from putting them on and trying it, is there a way to reasonably figure out if these tires will work for me?

For that matter, if I put them on, and they don't rub while turning sharply, what else can I test to make sure they are fitting ok?"	cars

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.** There are a number of bad actors on both sides of the electric vehicle argument and we've found ourselves regularly brigaded by members of both parties. 


On one hand we have anti-EV people who wish only for Tesla to fail and post articles (founded or not) that lambast Tesla and Elon Musk and anything to do with EVs, and on the other we have pro-Tesla folks (including an obstinate contingent of TSLA's own social media interns -- yes, we see you) who do all they can to spin the Tesla talk to positive.


This sort of William Randolph Hearst-esque **yellow journalism in which the headlines make the news is not acceptable here.** As one of the largest online automotive enthusiast forums operative (astonishingly, we're on track to hit 1,000,000 users by the end of the year) we have an obligation to keep our headlines fair and neutral, without giving preference to either contingent. 

Therefore, we've begun implementing some actions to minimize the effects of those acting in bad faith. **Going forward we'll be preemptively removing all EV submissions (and releasing them pending approval)** and taking a stronger stance against those who spam agenda-based posts. We will continue to monitor threads and will, as always, remove comments that are uncivil or encourage uncivil behavior (this means trolling and baiting, for instance). We will more aggressively monitor submissions for newsworthiness; one criterion will be, simply, ""Would this be newsworthy if it were about any other manufacturer?"" 

We will work to make sure that one voice does not dominate the discussion.


In short, we will not allow the Tesla War to be fought in our yard and follow us to our parlor. **This is not the place to promote your agenda;** our users have overwhelmingly indicated that, by and large, they don't want to see r/cars dominated by Tesla/EV/Musk headlines. r/teslamotors and r/realtesla exist and should be used. This isn't to say that we'll not allow any Tesla submissions: If an article passes the sniff test and is actually news, it is a valuable contribution to the subreddit and should be posted. However, we won't allow headlines to write the news and we want to make sure that we continue to have the best automotive community on the Internet.

So, as Abraham Lincoln said at the conclusion of the Civil War: [""Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S67sDHdhpio)

"I've started investigating a bit about gas quality, and one of the things that I usually see is that most posts have Arco on their shitlists. While many of the articles are a bit old, there are some that are from after they became Top Tier (even some that mention it) that still recommend against it. From what I know, pretty much all gas around me is E10 (and apparently, single supplier) so I'd guess most gas would be similar (especially TT); is there still a legitimate reason not to use Arco?

But recently I’ve seen people say they’re no good. I’ve used the Synthetic Guard ones forever and I do regular oil changes at 5000km intervals with synthetic oil. Without any problems and the oil always comes out rather clean for used oil. So I’m wondering with regular changes and good oil if using the lower grade ones won’t be that much of a worry. "	cars

3047	I think I have a problem... I was window shopping for a Corvette and jumped on a unicorn F150. I guess the Corvette can wait until next year.	"If you just want a quick description of the truck and pictures, skip down to the last paragraph. If you want my life story...

Confession time, I'm addicted to finding deals on Craigslist, and addicted to perpetually shopping for vehicles I don't need. I also have a soft spot for odd option combos, and vehicles with perfect histories.

Anyway, I have been slowed down on my Craigslist hunting the last couple months since I picked up my Jeep. The BRZ still has low miles and a warranty, so no need to replace that...

I went to Corvettes at Carlisle last weekend, and my lifelong desire for a Corvette ramped up severely. The last couple fun cars I bought were almost Corvettes, but I wound up with something else each time. I decided I want to finally do it next year, so I started researching the market.

Looking back, the last two times I shopped for a new second vehicle (snow, cargo space, etc), I looked for 10th gen F150s with the V8, 4x4, Manual, and an extended cab. I was starting to think they didn't exist, since the rare manuals I saw were V6 2wd or V8 4x4 regular cab.

In my aimless Craigslist refreshing of all manual transmission vehicles within like 50 miles, this truck popped up. 2000 F150: V8, Manual, 4x4, Extended Cab, Off Road Package, Tow Package, 1 owner, 103k miles, black, clean, bench seat, all service history, new tires, bla bla bla, $5.5k. I emailed him immediately, test drove and brought home the next day. He had to order it custom that way and even had the window sticker. All the big service items have been taken care of recently and he even detailed it (including polishing) before I showed up.

3048	E30 gas in 99 Cadillac Eldorado	Hello everyone! I have a cadillac eldorado 99 and I was wondering if anybody has had any experience using e30 (30% ethanol) gas mix? It's a non flex fuel vehicle. If you are wondering why I want to do this, the manual states I need 91 octane gas or higher or it will run badly. It says nothing about any specific ethanol levels, just needs to be 91 octane or better. Well the manual is right. It runs SUPER BAD on 87 octane, knocks, pings, misfires, and you can seriously feel the drop in power, all the issues go away when using the 91 as stated. Well 91 is super expensive compared to 87 ($3.20 vs 2.67). E30 94 octane is only $2.52! So it seems like I have a chance to get the performance of the expensive stuff and still pay less than I would for the useless regular. I have heard of people doing this manually by mixing e85 with the standard 87 gas to make 94 e30. It so happens a new gas station opened in my area with the new mixer pumps, and it has the option to make e30 for you by the same process and comes out the same hose. I've done alot of reading and it seems there should be no reason it shouldn't work. South dakota in 2016 started the e30 challenge where they extensively tested it in many non flex fuel vehicles and found that basically any car made after 1996 the computers would be able to adjust to the e30 just fine and run nearly with the same mpg as the regular gas. In fact the higher ethanol gives higher compression and actually improves performance and the higher octane improves the knock resistance. What I want to know is if anybody beyond these big testing groups have actually TRIED THIS themselves and had success? I haven't been able to find any posts about it anywhere. The only thing I read is that higher ethanol CAN damage or corrode some of the plastic parts and stuff in non FFVs, but it seems it applies to e85 mainly, and really only if you let your vehicle sit for a long time. My cadillac is my only car and my daily driver for work, so it won't be sitting for weeks on end without being driven. I fill up about 2 times a month. I know the real answer is to just try it and test the performance and see if any problems arise. I just want to hear if any of you guys have had experience with this. Thank you all!	cars

3051	2003 Mazda Protege Stereo Upgrade Question	"I'm about to start my career and very kindly my grandmother gifted me her old car.  Besides it being 15+ years old it is in great condition (~60k miles).  My only issue with the car, if you could call it that, is the stereo.  It has the stock CD player/radio right now, and I was thinking about upgrading it to a more modern stereo that has bluetooth.

My questions are these:

1) Is this a job I could do myself?  I watched a few video online and it seems like 70% of it would just be removing the old stereo, 10% wiring a harness adapter, 20% routing wires.

2) If this is a doable job, are there many tools/parts I would need?  It seems like tools are just a few removal tools and wire strippers.  Parts are: New stereo, Install kit (like a new bracket for the stereo), Harness Adapter, Crimp Caps, and Zip ties.

3) Is it better to just pay a professional to do this and if so how much would that generally cost?

4) Is this a waste of my time, and I should just buy a radio transmitter.  Also if so, are there any that you guys suggest?  I remember back in the day having one of them for my iPod and it sucked lol.

3064	What's your personal experience switching from stick shift to automatic?	"Many people switch from driving a vehicle with a manual transmission to one with an automatic transmission, for any number of reasons, including personal interest, physical difficulty, life stage, changing priorities, or needing to share with others.

What were the reasons for you and how did it go? Was it better or worse than you anticipated? Anything unexpected, whether positive or negative?"	cars
3065	Are there any car brands or models(aside from the super luxury/sports cars) that do not go cheap on the construction/build quality/part quality?	"Let me first clarify and provide examples of what I am talking about. 

* I define *construction* as mechanical design specific to reliability. For example, I know some of the late 90s early 2000s Subaru boxers had an engine redesign that made them prone to blown head gaskets. This would be an example of cheap construction. The cut a corner to save time and money. Subaru’s are still fairly reliable but this was a clear cost cutting measure. Design quirks like odd button placement or bad infotainment design are not what I consider cheap/bad. I don’t care how impractical the creature comforts are.

 * I define * build quality* as the materials used. For example, my VW GTI has a plastic oil pan. That is cheap. Why is a metal oil pan not presents. It doesn’t have to be carbon fiber, but use plastics where appropriate. Don’t make crucial parts out of cheap material. A plastic dashboard is fine, plastic oil pan is not fine.

* I define *part quality* as the reliability and longevity of the part. For example my Golf GTI uses a plastic oil plug that is designed to fail. 

I know every automaker that makes cars under $40,000 are doing something to cut corners but who is doing the least corner cutting? Who is making a car that just works. Even Toyota and Honda are using cheap materials in places they shouldn’t these days. Just about every car brand(excluding Nissan CVTs) is reliable these days if you car for it, but there has to be some objectively that is doing something utilitarian. "	cars
3066	Car serviced and vandalized story	"Two weeks ago I took my Nissan Murano 2012 to the Nissan dealer for regular oil change. After inspection it was found that 2 brakes and rotors need replacement, and a couple of sway bar links need change, CVT fluid, injector flush etc so almost $1500 work. 

Anyhow; work is done and  when leaving the dealership I noticed ""ABS"" and "" AWD"" warning lights were on, I though they will go off soon, car was working fine so I did not worry. Lights did not go off so, 1 week after, I checked the manual which said that it is abnormal and car needs to be seen by a mechanic.

The day I was returning to the dealer I noticed another warning light went on, the"" BRAKE"" one, on arrival I explained the situation to technician  who, after inspecting the car,  showed me that both front ABS/brake sensors were cut off. He told me that warning lights were on because of that. Service advisor  told me straightforwardly this was vandalism,  these wires (they look like thin hoses next to each wheel) are not exposed. I told him lights were on when I left the dealership 2 weeks ago. Dealership denied any wrongdoing on its part, advised me to put a police report and stay safe because someone tried to mess up my car brakes.

It is almost impossible this could be done anywhere else, my car is in private secured parking spaces at home and at work and, again, the warning lights were on (except the ""BRAKE"")  when I picked up my car from the dealer 2 weeks before .

Any alternative explanation to vandalism?

#Ford Territory

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ford-territory-blue-1-800x542.jpg)

No, not the Australian vehicle based on the Falcon platform, but this SUV made in China, which is a badge-engineered Yusheng 330.

It's got a 1.5-liter/143hp 4-cylinder turbo, but a PHEV hybrid is due soon.

Expected to sell for 90,000 CNY [that's around £10,100 - with VAT it'll be around £12,100], this is a budget SUV.

I like the looks of this one, and the EcoSport is too small and there's nothing smaller than the Kuga [Ford Escape in U.S. and Canada] in the line-up currently, so this would do the job.

#Chevrolet Orlando

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chevrolet-orlando-1-800x485.jpg)

This is another case of ""recycled name, different bodystyle"". 

It's got a 1.3-litre/156hp 4-cylinder turbo, although if it came to the U.S. or Canada wouldn't it get a 1.8 or 2.0 turbo?

I like the minivan-meets-crossover-SUV looks of this one.

#Ford Everest

Since Ford seem keen to launch new SUVs, I wouldn't mind one of these truck-based ones - we only get the Ranger pick-up here, which is in itself a pretty good vehicle.

I like the idea of the 2.0-liter/210hp 4-cylinder bi-turbo turbodiesel engine [2.0 TDCi EcoBlue 210], but I doubt it'd come here to the United Kingdom.

However, I'd probably go for the 2.5-liter/164hp 4-cylinder or the up-and-coming 2.3-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost [will this have around 280hp-300hp if I'm correct]?

It's a truck-like SUV, but that's one reason I like it.

3101	Do they HRVs just have poor seats and fabric in the interior in general? Or has it been fixed in the new model?	"Drove a HRV last night. Like it better than the Fit and the CRV but noticed the driver foot wells were always dirty and it looked like whoever drove them before was shedding skin on the drivers side door. The dealer needs to do a better job on cleaning some of these cars on the lot but did a lot of the presentation have to do with bad fabric. It seems like there were some things that were solid and some areas they went cheap on. 

Also I've seen references to people complaining about the seats but most google search results were from 2015 or earlier. They felt firm and tolerable but most said it wasn't really felt except on long drives. Does this still exist in the 2018s or later?

I'm cross shopping with the Forester so this is obviously the cheap option. I liked most of the features in the base better (except for the fabric) than the supposed upgrades and once you add AWD and leather to the HRV you're in Forester territory anyway. "	cars

I have a 2019 insight ex and recently curb rashed 2 wheels for about a quarter of the wheel, tires are completely fine just big scuffing. (Fell asleep at wheel)
Talking to alloy wheel repair shops near me, they said $150 a wheel for a fix and require 2 days. 
I can't be without a car that long so I found some quick fix scheme online and it was bad. I tried to use it but the included alloy color was way off to be expected. (Currently trying to take it off lol)

I was recently looking for replacement rims and it seems it's about $105-120 a rim depending on style (not oem) I was thinking about switching rims but to bigger 17/18 inch not replace 16 inch. So it's pay 300 for fix and hoping it's the same or replace all 4 for about 420+ then to install it would probably be an extra 100 I'm guessing. Even if I do replace my rims what would I do with the or rims?

I was having issues with rough idling that got worse over last week to the extent my car was dying (or nearly) when I stopped. It jerked under idle power forward and back, and sometimes was hard to start. So I took it into a local mechanic that I trusted and they decided that it was the PCV valve / assembly. When I picked it up it was worse... amazingly my A/C was no longer cooling and the car jerked even more, braked weird and even got a stability control error. I took it back up and they re-scanned it. The codes said I had some BUS communication errors with the A/C and a misfire on cylinder 2.

At that point they were scratching their heads as the PCV valve shouldn't of caused any other issues. They mentioned it wasn't even close to the A/C components so they didn't even suspect the mechanic knocked something loose etc. And that point they recommended taking it into the dealer.

So I did and I just got a call that it was a bad injector and A/C sensor.

Now I am wondering if messing around with the PCV valve could knock out the A/C sensor somehow? Or is this just an amazing coincidence? I can't find anyone with opinions on this. Also... could both the injector and PCV valve of been bad? Or do you think they just shot from the hip, I assume those symptoms make sense. But I didn't know what others did in these situations when a mechanic replaces something and it's not right.

(OK guess this got a little long sorry)

3121	[OC] Dispelling the myth that Americans uniquely dislike manual transmission – The opposite might be true!	"**TLDR at bottom**

So, you hang out long enough in car forums, and eventually you’ll see sentiment like this: “Damned [other] American drivers, hating manual transmission, if Americans didn’t hate manual so much, I can get [insert car here] in manual!” This usually shows up in discussions about how certain car models are losing the manual transmission, or in reviews of new cars when someone says something along the lines of “I’d love to buy [insert car], but it doesn’t come in manual”. 

Plenty of people seem to believe that Americans (and Canadians I guess) uniquely dislike manual transmission, that consumers outside of North America like manuals. Many different explanations are given by various different people about why this phenomenon exists, yet the idea that north American buyers uniquely hate manual has almost never been questioned. After all, 2% of new cars sold in the US today are manual.

Well I’m not denying that buyers in North American are more likely to buy automatic, but I’ve always thought the idea that only buyers in North America hate manual transmission is a myth. Today, I’m going to prove that North American buyers don’t uniquely dislike manual transmission, that the same phenomenon exists in similar forms in two other key markets (China and Germany). I will also show that there exists evidence the opposite might even be true, enthusiasts in North Americans uniquely love manual transmission.

Let’s start with China, they are the world’s biggest country, and the world’s biggest automotive market by number of cars sold. [The market share for automatics in China is around 70%](https://www.jiemian.com/article/1719103.html), way lower than in the United States, but let’s break down the numbers shall we?

I went on China’s well known automotive website Autohome (think Chinese Car and Driver) to look for cars. First thing I did, was to look at the sports car category, set the filter to manual transmissions only, and I got, [nothing. Well, ok, not exactly nothing, but you get a bunch of Morgans, and that weird X-Bow thing made by KTM, the motorcycle company.](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-7-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html) 

Yep, that’s right, with the discontinuation of the Toyota 86 (2017 was the last model year), not a single sports car in China is sold with manual. What about the Mustang you ask? Automatic only. The Camaro? Automatic only. BMW M2? Auto only. 718? Same thing, automatic only. 

Of course, you can get base Civics, Corollas, Cavaliers (Chevy’s volume compact is the Cavalier in China), etc in manual. But let’s say, I want a car with some basic luxuries. So I went back to the search page, and looked for a manual transmission car with a few basic features that one would consider “premium” in 2018: Leather powered seats, cruise control, LED headlights, and automatic climate control. [What I got was 1 car in the whole Chinese market, some crappy FWD SUV that is never sold outside of China](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-2_6_7_9_13-0-0-0-0-0-1.html#!). (It is also a pretty blatant Acura ripoff, it even has the beak haha). You can’t even find a car with heated seats with manual in China.

Think about it for a second. If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a manual sports car? If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a car that is equipped with the most basic options with manual? The only way this makes sense IMO is that the majority of Chinese customers dislike manual, the only reason why manual’s market share is higher is because there are plenty of people who cannot afford the automatic option. In fact, the moment you start adding even the most basic options, you can’t get manual anymore. Why? Because overall, Chinese consumers prioritize automatic to the point where, if they can only afford a single option, it would be the automatic transmission.

Now let’s take a look at Germany, I picked them as an example because they have a strong domestic automotive industry, and that German automobiles are exported worldwide, including to North America. So I went on the German website mobile.de to look at listings (AKA, cars currently advertised for sale), and overall, 58% of new car listings are manual. Hey, that’s pretty good for manual transmissions you’d think! But let’s dig a bit further.

Let’s start with sports cars shall we? So I selected the sports cars and convertibles option, and immediately the manual transmission rate drops to 31%. Now the rate is probably actually even lower because this weird [Piaggio APE Calessino Euro 4 3 wheeled thing](https://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=266939234&amp;categories=Cabrio&amp;categories=SportsCar&amp;damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&amp;isSearchRequest=true&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;scopeId=C&amp;usage=NEW&amp;fnai=next&amp;searchId=74bb0a1b-ef47-f5e2-66b3-03eb5f83503e) that only comes in manual counts as a “convertible”, which I don’t think counts as a car for obvious reasons (There’s also a huge number of manual Beetle, Smart, and Fiat 500 listings, cars I don’t necessarily consider sports cars). Hmm, so overall, German sports car drivers prefer automatic over manual? This almost seems like the opposite of what we see in North America. 

Let’s dig in a little bit deeper and break it down shall we? Overall, 26.1% of Audi, 20.9% of BMW, and 8.59% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual. But remember, in Germany (unlike many export markets), these brands aren’t necessarily “luxury”, they also sell lower specced entry level vehicles (IE: The 318i with cloth interior). If we were to limit these brands to their higher priced offerings only, the manual rate again drops sharply. 

Above 50 thousand euros, only 1.01% of Audi, 1.97% of BMW, and 0.09% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual, in line with manual take rates in the United States. In fact, once you consider Porsche (a company that doesn’t sell cars cheaper than 50 thousand dollars/euros), American Porsche buyers are slightly more likely to buy manuals, 3.87% of German listings are manual, but 4.13% of American ones (on autotrader) are. 

Now if you go and search German sports car and convertible listings above 50 thousand euros, only 11% of them are manual. Interestingly enough, more than a quarter of them are Mustangs, and nearly 16% of them are Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes (Chevrolet literally has 5 dealers in all of Germany). There are currently 27 manual BMW sports cars or convertibles being advertised in Germany above the price of 50 thousand at this moment. Zero Mercedes Benz, and 3 Audis. If we use 50 thousand as the threshold for ""high end"", the German big 3 has a total of 30 high end sports cars for sale. Adding in Porsche, the big 4 German luxury brands have a total of 102 high end sports cars for sale. In comparison, if we search high end sports cars above $50 thousand USD (I know it is lower than 50 thousand euros, but european prices contain tax), 15% of them are manual on autotrader, and a good number of them are Audi's and BMWs. 

So I would conclude that German buyers are in a way similar to American and Chinese buyers in that they don’t show preference for manual transmissions, after all, German manufacturers don’t offer their flagships in manual. For instance, you can get a manual Mercedes Benz A class, but you can’t get a Mercedes Benz S class in manual. But unlike American and Chinese customers, Germans don’t consider automatic too high on their priorities list, they are willing to spend the money on certain other options before selecting automatic, but the fundamental phenomenon is still the same. Germans don’t prefer manual when they are willing to spend money, as Germans who buy expensive cars overwhelmingly choose automatic. In fact, I’m willing to take it one step further, Germans don’t like manual, they just dislike it a little less than Americans and Chinese drivers do.

I’m going to extrapolate a little bit from these two key markets and say that, to the majority of consumers worldwide, automatic is the preferred transmission. After all, good modern automatics are faster and/or get better fuel economy. The only difference is how willing consumers are to spend money on the automatic option (and how much money they have to spend in General). North American car buyers are simply more willing to spend money on the automatic (and on so many North American model cars, auto is a no-cost option). 

In fact weirdly enough, the data suggests that American enthusiasts might be the largest group of people who prefer manual out there. After all, the highest end American performance cars are all available with manual (Hellcat Challenger, Shelby Mustang, Corvette), but the same cannot be said about German (AMG GT, Audi R8, TTRS, hell, any AMG) or Japanese (Nissan GTR, Lexus LC, Lexus LFA) performance cars. Of the four German brands that make performance cars (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche, and Audi), two of them (BMW, Porsche) claim that it was American demand that allowed them to sustain manual transmission development. Hell, Chinese enthusiasts don't care for manual at all! Even the Miata is automatic only in China. 

So in conclusion, the data suggests that US consumers aren’t the only ones who dislike manual transmission, consumers China, Germany, and likely other markets probably don’t like manual either. In fact, US enthusiasts are probably the ones that you should thank for the continual existence of the manual transmission performance car. 

**TLDR:** American customers aren't unique in preferring automatic over manual, they're just the ones most willing/able to pay for it. But American enthusiasts may very well be unique in their overwhelming preference for manual transmission. "	cars

3123	Need some advice	"This might be a long shot, but I want some advice because I cannot figure out what the issue might be with my car. 

I have a Renault Mégane 1.6 16v Sport 1999. Lovely car, apart from one thing... I have a high idle speed when it's cold up to about 2000 RPM, unless I release the clutch slightly in which case it'll go to about 1100RPM. Sometimes when I'm driving along it'll accelerate slightly by itself if I take my foot of the gas pedal, then suddenly slowing after about 30 seconds. Switching off the engine when at a complete stop will judder the entire car. 

Once the car has reached optimal temperature of 90°C, the problem basically disappears.

I've repositioned the throttle cable as it wasn't in the correct place, which sorted the issue temporarily. I'm possibly thinking spark plug, but there is no check engine light and it's been acting like this for a few months now. Possibly a bad throttle body?

A bit of background. A few weeks ago I purchased a used 07 Elantra. It very quickly presented an issue with the transmission (limp home mode with a TCC solenoid code along with trans temp sensor code). Dealer replaced the temp sensor and the issue has not reemerged.

That said, now I’m hyper sensitive to how the transmission is performing. I’ve noticed a behavior and would love to know if it’s at all abnormal.

As you’ll see in the gif, when it shifts from 3rd to 4th, the RPMs fall, but... bounce slightly?

I have no loss of power or lack of smoothness to the cars engine. Only the lack of smoothness to the falling RPMs between gears. Any reason to be concerned? Is this completely normal behavior?

3126	Hi guys - Few issues with a Peugeot 206, need some advice.	"So, some basics:

Year: 2009

Transmission: Manual

Fuel type: Petrol

Miles: 74k


Over the past week or 10 days I’ve noticed a problem. It started with the back of the car shuddering on take off, like it was lagging behind the rest of the car. The clutch pedal has also become stiffer, it takes slightly more effort to depress it than usual. I dunno if I’m imagining it, but I think it’s also got a higher biting point than it used to. 

Then, this morning I got into reverse, and the whole car was shuddering when I was reversing at the biting point. I’m gonna book into a mechanic ASAP, but could you guys give me some advice as to what exactly could be causing it? No engine lights are on. Even though it flashes on when I turn the ignition, so the light isn’t broken. 

Could it be the clutch? I’ll check the service history but think a new clutch was fitted by the old owner at ~55k miles. I know I need a new timing belt fitted, but should I be prepared for anything else?

3141	Buy an extended warranty or trade in 2015 Buick Enclave	"My wife drives a 2015 Buick Enclave with ~62K miles, which we are still paying off ($17,000 remaining). We've had a few problems (AC leak, a faulty sensor) which of course came in right after the warranty expired, and she's just not feeling like this has lots of reliability in it. Everything so far seems to be up around the $750 to $1500 range to fix, and that'll add up very quickly **if** other stuff goes wrong.

We started talking about trading it in (looking at an Acura MDX), but financially that's a big hit. I figure the Enclave probably has enough value to cover the payoff, but that's it. So I'm not convinced that's a good route to go. The flip side is we take a few long trips in the December-February time frame (several hours each way in northeast USA) for teenage daughter's sporting commitments, and having the peace of mind that we won't break down on a busy road in wintry conditions is worth a lot.

I got a quote for an extended warranty for 4 years/80K miles that came in at $4,639. That seems high; what reputable companies should I approach for a quote? Is that price reasonable?

Summary: should we call it quits on the Enclave and trade it in (accepting it's going to be harsh financially), get an extended warranty to hedge financially, or cross fingers and hope the problems we've had so far aren't indicative of more to come?"	cars

3152	Painful dragging sound in 3rd gear	I just bought a 6 speed 2001 Mazda Miata SE less than a week ago, the man I bought it from took really great care and had receipts for all repairs done. One of the repairs being a new clutch (not sure if that has any significance). I’ll be the first to say I’m not amazing at driving stick, but I’m definitely not the worst. I’ve gotten fairly decent in the past few days at shifting and whatnot, but every time I shift into third gear this painful metallic dragging sound comes from somewhere in the car (I can’t figure out if it’s coming from the front or beneath- I’m assuming it’s the front), it’s continuous and builds volume until I reach 2-25000 rpms and then it just stops completely.

The 2007 IS350 sported the longitudinal 2GR-FSE (roughly the same motor, but with direct+port injection) with 306bhp. 3,430-3,650lbs (pretty similar).

Most accounts listed the IS350 as doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds.

The Camry V6 was listed by most accounts as doing 0-60 in 5.8-5.9 seconds.

I’m wondering why this would be. You would think the Camry would be at a major disadvantage of being FWD (with terrible weight distro), having an open diff, and having skinny 215 tires.

The IS350 is slightly handicapped from the get-go by having an open diff and only 225-width tires, but wouldn’t the RWD be enough to at least give it a 0.3+ second head start in straight-line acceleration?

Obviously handling will be day and night- that is no question. But it seems the IS was a severe underperformer given the power output and other cars in its class. Maybe the 4.09 diff ratio was ill-suited to the transmission?"	cars
3161	Its not always cheaper to buy then rent...[RANT]	"Just like Yoplait, sweet tldr on the bottom, life story on top.

So, a little background. My wife and I are from the Balkans, and since we had kids, we've been coming to Croatia every summer for at least 5 weeks to hang out with family and to expose the kids to our native culture. We also travel a lot when we come, so in the past we had been renting cars. This usually ends up costing about 2000 euros per month because we always need a van or wagon and we travel internationally, etc. 

This year I managed convince my work to let me work remotely, so we decided to come for 3 months instead. Well, I didn't feel like dropping 6000 euros for a rental car so we decided we should just buy our own, and leave it with my mother in law, so we would have a car that  would be cheaper than renting over time, and worst case scenario, could re-sell and be out of pocket a much smaller amount. We decided to get a wagon, van or suv and budgeted 8000 euros as our limit.

Well, I know a bit about cars, so I did a bunch of craigslist (njuskalo) shopping around before we came and had lined up a bunch of cars to go take a look at. I even brought my OBD2 reader as backup. Well after spending a week going to see a bunch of used and abused jalopies, we finally found a really nice 2013 Peugeot 508SW 2.0HDI. It was high milage (140,000) but the guy who owned it was a traveling salesman and took really good care of it. It only had 3 issues I wasn't stoked on.

1. Its a 6 speed semi auto...really wanted a manual in Europe of all places
2. It needed a new coolant hose, the old one just looked a little worn
3. The guy had his elbow in the same place for 5 years and had actually created a dent in the interior door panel.

Apart from that the car was great. I did a full under and over inspection on it, it drove great, shifted great, no faults, no creaks nothing. The guy was asking $9000 for it, but I managed to talk him down to eight.

Immediately I took it to the dealer and had them change out all the fluids, filters and the messed up hose and update all the software to the latest version. I also had them change out the timing belt and water pump as those are the first to go. This service cost me another 1000euros, but I figured if we're gonna hang onto this car for a few years, its gonna be worth making sure its in great shape.

And it was. We drove it up and down the coast, went to Italy with it and a bunch of city driving, and the kids got a kick out of going through all the tunnels with the panoramic roof. Then one day as we were headed to Italy for the second time, we got stuck in the border crossing line and as we're stop and going, the transmission starts to jerk...A LOT. It feels like it drops out of gear, then just slams it into 1st when I let off the brake. I put it into manual mode and its fine, but I was getting sketched out. I park it in Trieste for a few hours, and on the trip back, it shifts fine. Then a few days later we're headed to one of the islands and I notice that every time it shifts from 5th to 4th its rough.

My first though is that its oil, but I did a bunch of research and apparently these gearboxes are supposed have lifetime oil, but a bunch of people have issues with the valve bodies going to shit (Aisin AW6 if you're interested). So I take it back to the authorized service center and they wont touch automatics and they send me to a little mom and pop shop that apparently specializes in autos. I call them, but they're booked for a week and we were going to Dalmatia the following week so no one would be able to touch it for 2 weeks. We drive down (about 250 miles) the next week and its definitely shifting rough, but since its mostly freeway, it never really leaves 6th gear. 

So finally we get back last week and the very next day I take it to the shop and the guy tells me its probably just the oil. They go to change it and its tar black. They end up changing it twice, just because it was in such a bad condition, a single change it was still bleeding black. Apparently they recommend changing that oil every 60000km and call the ""lifetime"" label bullshit. He also tells me to drive it around for a while and if its still rough, we'll probably going to have to change the valve body (1000 euro for the part + labor).

Next few days Im driving it around and its night and day. The car is more responsive, smooth, dare I say feels faster. No issues in traffic, no rough shifts. I think AWESOME, a $100 gear oil change just saved my ass. So yesterday I had a doctors appointment in Ljubljana, about 2 hours away and in a different country. The family and I decide to make it a day trip and as we're driving out there the car is doing great. No issues at speed, smooth shifts, the border crossing handled like a champ! That is until the second we got off the highway in Ljubljana. As I'm pulling up to the light, the gearbox clunks, and ""Gearbox Fault, get immediate service"" message comes on the dash. The car locks me in 3rd gear but luckly its a diesel, so it has the needed torque to get it going...but I top out at about 40mph. So I limp it to the doctors office, get my exam and while waiting find a Peugeot dealer...only dealer in the fucking country, a few miles away. So we jump in the car again, and the fault is gone, but its shifting rough again. I get it to the dealer after a day to diagnose it, I get the bad news...I need a new valve body...to the tune of 2100 euros. 

I looked up used trannies for this car, called around, and in Croatia I would have ended up having to pay around $1500 euros, but with towing fees, it would come out about the same. So my whole plan of buy a car for 8000 euros because it will pay off in a year or two, is now a car of 12000  euros...and its still a fucking automatic...sigh.

TLDR: Visiting Croatia for 3 months, decided it would be cheaper to buy a car then rent one. Bought a used car from a private party, inspected it, scanned it, drove it. Everything was great, then the automatic gearbox starts acting up. Changed the oil and boom, back to perfect again, then yesterday, I drove 2 hours to a different country only for it to throw up a ""gearbox fault"" and I'm out 2100 euros for a new valve body.

3179	What do you guy's think of Chrysler Corporation after the Lee Iacoca years?	"If there's one thing I've learned about Chrysler Corp in my years of being an automotive enthusiast, it's always that they were always a roller-coaster of successes and failures. They were always the underdog in third place fighting for the domestic market with Ford and General Motors.

The 70s almost saw them die, and the 80s saw their amazing resurgence. It seems however, their story kind of gets forgotten about towards the mid to late 90s, up to the present day. 

I mean that in both terms of models sold, and company reputation. Nobody ever talks about Chrysler besides their performance oriented line of vehicles. In an ironic way, AMC's formidable Jeep subdivision seems to have been (and still be?) Chrysler's most valuable asset. 

I'm not sure what got me on this train of thought. I think it's because I got interested in the Dodge Intrepid SXT models, and realized the total lack of interest for any of Chrysler's more casual or low tier sport vehicles. Was their reliability that horrible? Was it just Chrysler suffering from smaller market share? 

In my day to day life, I still see tons of late 90s and early 00s GM or even Ford vehicles. Chrysler Corp passenger vehicles just seem to be all but gone. I still see a load of trucks and jeeps though. 

As a casual observer, does anyone have any fond memories of Chrysler's vehicles in the late 90s? Were they any good? 
What do you think of their brand focus today? 

I kind of can't believe Chrysler ditched the affordable compact market in favor of ""muscle"" cars, cuvs/suvs, and trucks. I mean, the dart was all but unadvertised. It's barley even getting any performance oriented attention either. I've also heard general reliability is a lot to be desired as well. 

It seems like the company hasn't known what the hell they're doing since the 08 recession. Possibly even prior to that. Regardless of sales, they still seem to be suffering in reliability. 

Edit: Some words because people are anal.

3180	Suspected Head Gasket Leak?	2005 Honda Cr-v 111k miles. Just bought this car. Cylinder 4 was misfiring so I replaced the spark plugs and that seemingly solved the problem.. until now. My car has had rough idle but it would usually go away if I turned off the AC, so I didn’t think much of it. Today my engine light came back on for a Cylinder 4 misfire again. Now, when I replaced the spark plugs, I also had someone check the coils and he said there was no problem with the coils. So, I don’t feel like I need to replace the coil. Recently, I took my car to the mechanic for an unrelated issue and when I had my boyfriend follow me back he noticed a thin white smoke coming out of my exhaust.

3190	Worth dealing with rust?	"We own a 2006 Honda Pilot.  Have had for several years, under 120k miles.

 This vehicle has been 90% garage kept, generally left out in the summer as our garage becomes filled with bikes/scooters, etc.  

This gen of Pilot has some very common rust issues. I see it pretty much every time I see this model around here (Ohio).

Local body shop that has a rep for being quality and low priced quoted $700 to fix these spots and would need to keep the car for 3 days.  They said they would be cutting out metal, replacing, painting.  The car is probably only worth $5-6k, so I have trouble with the idea of dropping that much on an older vehicle for what seems like a cosmetic problem.

https://m.imgur.com/a/TBRoT2h

Is it really just a cosmetic problem only, or is this going to lead to bigger problems?  We just bought a newer van so this is pretty much just a vehicle for me to drive back and forth to work, the family trips will be in the van.  I intend to drive this for at least 3-5 more years unless some big repair or something else gets in the way. 

I've also searched around on YT for videos, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4vusY2-rkQ 

I know this might not be the way to properly fix this, but if I can get it looking cosmetically better for under $100 I'm not opposed to that.  I realize the correct way is probably taking it to the pros at the shop, I just can' decide if it's worth that.

I was thinking of using acoustic roxul rock wool -however the only thing that worries me is having so much rock wool concentrated in a tiny miata cabin.  This might sound a bit stupid - but I've never use such insulation  and I'm not sure if its safe - i.e bumps causing fibers to float around and being breathed in by me and a passenger.

Alternate option is fulling bags with the stuff and forcing it in the cavity.

I had done most of my research on Edmunds and LeaseHackr and had an idea of what I wanted to pay; I basically brought my research and calculations in with me and showed them I felt I should be able to get it for and ended up paying within a few dollars of my goal.


**Exterior**: I think the car looks great and rather sporty. I went with the Vesuvio Gray Metallic paint and it hides dirt well. It’s a bit lower than my last car, a 2015 Hyundai Genesis, but not by much and I’m pretty used to lower cars. I live in one of the snowiest cities in America, so we’ll see how it goes through the winter, but with snow tires and AWD it should be simple considering I drove a 2002 Dodge Neon with bald tires for a few years in college in the same weather.


**Interior**: I went with the one with red leather. I love it. The overall interior is high quality with a lot of soft touch surfaces in all the right places. It was a bit small at first coming from the Genesis, but I have no problems with it now. I don’t think anyone much taller than I could fit into the seat without their head touching the ceiling. The trunk and trunk opening are relatively small, but I can fit most things I need to in there and the seats fold down (thank god, they didn’t in the Genesis). The back seat is somewhat tight with taller people sitting up front but would be fine for shorter trips. My back seat is occupied by 2 dogs 99% of the time so it isn’t a problem.


**Technology**: The controls in general are pretty intuitive. There are some exceptions. The turn signal stock doesn’t click and stay in the spot you push it in to, it basically just goes up/down and then back to center. A hard push keeps the signal on until you complete a turn and a lighter one just blinks a few times for lane changes. It took a bit to get used to at first, but I’m used to it now.


The engine auto start/stop is interesting, but annoying when it’s hot out. It shuts the AC off for the most part and it can get hot inside quick. It does, however, fire up fast and I haven’t had any issues with it. I turn it off when it’s hot out.


My one gripe is the lack of touch screen, but I’ve also gotten used to that. Though I would still like one. It does have CarPlay and Android Auto but using them without a touch screen is somewhat annoying. The click wheel in the center works fine for navigating for the most part and the rest of the controls are all on the wheel or easily accessible. The entertainment system does boot up the instant I turn the car on, which is great since the Genesis would take a few seconds (or longer sometimes).


All the other fancy driving aids seems to work well. The adaptive cruise I’ve used several times and works fine, the lane departure warning works, but it doesn’t automatically steer you back into the lane so I’ve just turned it off since it can get annoying (it makes a sound that sounds like rumble strips whereas the Genesis just had the wheel vibrate and steered you back into the lane which was great).


**Performance**: Coming from the boat that is the Genesis (currently the G80) this thing is quick and handles amazingly well. The steering is very tight. I opted for the adjustable dampers and it’s noticeable going between the two levels. 


In normal driving mode the car is pretty standard, quiet, and handles the road well. In Dynamic (aka Sport) mode it is significantly tighter, rougher, and you can feel every part of the road (which is awesome). Sport also seems to tighten up the steering and the way it manages the gears is very aggressive compared to other cars with a sport mode that I’ve driven. The way it manages the gears and feels in general is reminiscent of a Ferrari 488 I recently drove on vacation in Italy (which I guess makes sense). There is definitely a huge difference between normal and Dynamic modes; far more than any car I’ve driven in the past.


In both modes the paddles are amazing. They feel great and respond extremely quick.


There is also a mode called Advanced Efficiency which I cannot review as I have only ever driven in it during the test drive, though I think the way it gimps the throttle response will be helpful in the winter.


I think the epa mpg is something like 23/31. In my first 1500 miles or so I’ve sat around 20mpg city and the one long road trip I took was over 38mpg highway (cruising at ~80 the whole way, which is even more impressive). I could definitely improve the city mileage, but na.


Feel free to ask any questions!

Edit: I forgot to mention, I was super annoyed because apparently WeatherTech doesn't make front mats for this car, so I ended up going with these ones called Tux Mats. They are really nice and match the quality of the interior really well.

Here are a couple pics of the car and of the floor mats/seat: https://imgur.com/a/bKHzugB

For my Rav4 I know I've been under the expected repair costs quite a bit. They say $400-2200$ on maintenance and $300-$600 on repairs, and I come in at the low end if not lower consistently.

3205	How does tires pressure affect pressure?	"Hey guys.

I've been eager to learn how tire pressure affects the heat-up of the tires.

My logic says the less PSI you have, the more the tire will deform thus will heat up quicker, also due to a bigger contact patch.

However, my friend says it's the opposite and that reducing tire pressures allow the tire to cool down as it isn't pressed down as hard.

Is there a definitive answer?

 Hi.  Just noticed bumps on my driver side door on my Infiniti G37. And it's  not dings - three bumps are sticking out. And I don't see any other damages.  So most probably it was not external object.

It looks like someone/something pushed door out from inside which is most probably not the case.

3230	On-the-go Auto repairs in Mad Max: Fury Road, Is This Possible?	"Evening r/cars.
I've been watching Mad Max: Fury Road like, once a year now, because I love the movie. However something cool (but also maybe unrealistic, maybe) I've always noticed is that at least twice in the film the War Rig (an 18-wheeler tanker) is tuned up or repaired *while the Rig is still in motion and active.* Here's a fuzzy clip from youtube of Furiosa going under the cab to do repairs while the rig is still in motion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWaNT3byVU

I guess my question is, in an 18-wheeler like we have in the movie, or any vehicle in general, is it actually possible to fix any part of the engine or coolant system while the vehicle is in use. About three times in Max Max: Fury Road does the engine(s) go out or become inoperative, and all of them *appear* to stem from overheating, so I'm going to assume all of the 'repairable' parts have to do with the coolant system, but I could be wrong. Also the rig appears to have more than one engine-- is this even possible?

Also this is probably not in the vein of this reddit, so I apologize if it's a bit of an off-shoot. I can't find clips of the main characters fixing the engine while it moves. But in either case, thanks and I look forwards to hearing your dude's ideas.

3232	Making sure a car is good for high-intensity use. 2011 mini cooper s.	"Hi. I recently(read: about 1 year ago) really got into cars. I never really paid too much attention to my own as they were hand-me-downs, but I've recently realized one of my cars is moderately decent and needs some serious love(2011 Mini cooper S. 2.0 liter turbo).

I'd like to be confident in this car to the point where I wouldn't be hesitant to take this car to a track/drag strip day or two. Granted, yeah, mini, but it does have a 0-60 of about 6 and a quarter mile in the 15-s. Either way, beggers can't really be choosers and I am not the richest man.

all that being said, it has about 60k miles. I've done regular service on time. Oil, coolant, tires, everything. It's probably never been taken above 5k rpms in it's entire life. Most if it's life has been driving 75mph in 6th gear with minimal clutch usage.

Is there anything special I should do or check before actually using the car to more of it's potential? There are no error codes, and there has never been an engine problem with this entire car.

So far, I'm planning on installing a boost gauge to see what the turbo is doing, in addition to installing a temperature gauge. I'm also planning on changing the oil and getting a coolant flush. Anything major I'm missing here?

3233	Guides to EFI tuning?	"This may be the wrong sub, but here goes...

I also want to maximize torque and horsepower by optimizing throttle tables, etc... I’m not looking for info on boosted applications either. I’m only NA right now. Maybe in the future I hope!

3236	A question about fancy vs. budget tyres	"Hello people who know things about cars, I know little and come seeking your knowledge.

I need to buy four new tyres for my car. I use it normal use - commuting and occasional long distances (for the UK anyway), no racing or shenanigans like that. Currently I've got Continental tyres which came with the car. I'm led to believe they're relatively expensive as tyres go. They're double the price of some of the ones I'm seeing to replace them with.

My question is this: if I were to buy these ""budget"" tyres, would I notice any real difference in typical use? Would it feel any different? Would it last half the time of the comparatively expensive tyre? Is there any point in me paying more if I'm driving to work not a racetrack?

2016 Honda Civic EX-T, OEM tire is a 215/50R17 91H

Currently limping around on my spare tire (left rear) after getting a nail that can't be repaired.  Donut tire.  Short 8 mile commute and minimal other driving.

My tire place has a 95V Michelin Premier A/S tire set in stock, but I could potentially order a 91H but would have to wait a week or two for delivery before I could install.

Is there a big issue and/or will it be negatively noticeable both from a ride quality or fuel issue to have a 95V vs the 91H?

​

Also... the tire I think really prefer (Michelin Primacy MXM4) is on back order.  Looking at the Premier, it's not as highly rated.  Tire guy said only complaint about Premier was they don't seem to get to their mileage warranty, but I don't drive all that much, so I figure tire will dry rot before I get that high in the miles.  Any thoughts on that?

​

Thanks much, and any other input appreciated.  FWIW - Trying to stick with Costco after previous bad experiences with Discount Tire.  Local place an option if necessary, though seems will be pricier.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Does a 95V tire vs an OEM 91H tire make any difference whatsoever for normal commuting type stuff?  And would it be worth waiting a week or two driving on a spare to get the 91H if so?"	cars

3262	Car Rant.	"I'm 21 years old and my family has an extra car laying around (my mothers old car that was meant for me and my brother when she got a new car) that I have been driving to and from Community College. It's a 2011 Toyota Corolla. It f\*cking sucks. It's the most bland boring vanilla car there is. It doesn't turn heads and does NOT get me p\*ssy like if I had a sports car. It's great on gas mileage though.

I'm a senior in college and I work part time while going to school and my mother insists that I just keep driving the Corolla while saving my money for a newer better car. My brother lives at school so while he's at school I get to drive the Corolla to and from my community college. (My mother said it's the equivalent towards his dorm...actually cheaper). So she doesn't mind me using it. I have $6k in the bank and it's growing. My dad tells me that he's impressed with how much money I have saved because when he was in college most of it went to stupid stuff and he never had around that much money. (Also because he lived on campus so he was limited to where and how much he could work). But $6k IS NOT ALOT OF MONEY. However I have to pay for my phone, gas, books, miscellaneous college stuff. I've been told by both my parents that If I continue to save by the end of the school year I will be on track with around $9-10k in my bank account. Enough (from them) to buy me a better newer safer ""cooler"" car.

As it sits now, at $6k I really couldn't even buy a new sports car??? Chances are my budget will limit me to an older Civic/Accord/Camry/Corolla so my parents said just drive the newer one that I am driving now. BUT IT PISSES ME THE FRICK OFF whenever I roll up to campus lot and see kids with new-ish WRX's, BRZ/FRS and Mustangs. How? HOW DID THEY AFFORD THAT?! I'm so salty and jealous of them. I work my ass off but I have to pay for phone, rent, books, gas, clothes, deodorant (that random shit). I am luckily provided free food because I do the dishes and earn my keep around the house.

HOWEVER I DRIVE A FRICKEN TOYOTA COROLLA! How am I suppose to impress the chicks like the kids with the WRXs, and Mustangs!?!?! HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HAVE A COOL FUN CAR.

We considered everything from the quality of cars produced the importance of the cars they made the affordability and the overall success. We tossed around every name from the working class hero of ford making affordable cars through the ages and starting the pony car revolution with the mustang. Alfa Romeo for its consistent production of beautiful, flashy and well performing cars. Aston Martin for its style and luxury. Or even Audi for bringing all wheel drive to the common road car with the Quattro. Keep in mind we’re considering the entire history of every company. Just want to know your thoughts. 	cars

I've been daily driving a '95 Miata with 175,000 miles for over a year and while I enjoyed the car at first, it's been having a ton of ""old car problems"" that's making me hate driving my car. The A/C doesn't work half the time and when it does blow cold, it screws with the idle of the car making it almost undrivable in traffic. The engine makes weird noises every once in a while. The old suspension has started creaking and groaning as I drive over every bump. I've replaced all of the coolant hoses, water pump, timing belt, valve cover gasket, and the old radiator cap and it's still leaking coolant and oil from somewhere. It's got cheap looking aftermarket wheels and literally the cheapest Walmart tires you can buy. The brand new cheapo soft top I spent an entire weekend installing just 8 months ago is already falling apart. The speakers sound like shit too so I can't even listen to my music in traffic without hearing static. I could go on and on and yet it still starts up every single morning and still looks decent for it's age.

Yeah it's a fun car and I still enjoy rowing through the gears and wringing out all that 125 hp when I get the chance. Yet, as a daily, it's been driving me crazy every day. I can't afford to do anything to it other than basic maintenance and I don't even have a garage anymore to work on it myself. I'd sell it but I honestly don't know what else I could replace it that would still be affordable, well-maintained by previous owners, and at least somewhat fun to drive.

Before I was a car guy, I drove an equally shitty Ford Taurus and never complained. Honestly, sometimes I wish I was still driving around that big old sedan because I couldn't care less about it."	cars

The first time I saw it, I thought something looked fishy because he has the M3 carbon diffuser and vents cut into his hood. I went around back and saw an M3 badge (wrong size), pasted at a 45 degree angle on the trunk. 

I've seen him a few different times and last night I finally lost it in a drunken rant. I saw him stopped at a red light, asked him why his M3 has an N54 and the wrong fenders. He said ""cause i'm paid"", and drove off with all 6 cylinders firing. 

My confusion is essentially this- 

The only people that would know what an M3 is, or would be at all impressed by an M3, are the same people who can tell the difference between a real one and a copy. So what is the point of it? Insecurity? 

It's the same shit with fake AMG badging on the wrong side of the trunk, RS5 badges on an A5, etc. etc.

She drove it across the Nullarbor from Tasmania to WA &amp; in her 35 years of ownership it only broke down on her once &amp; she cried when it was put on the tow truck! 

She is very particular about it’s maintenance, with one mechanic looking after it for her all it’s life.

She adored her 86 &amp; it really showed, the car was immaculate inside and out. She told me she gets inundated with guys following her around offering her big money for the car but she will never ever sell it.

3302	Comparing the 2018 Ford Fusion vs the 2018 Ford Edge – Or why the crossover is winning	"**TL;DR at bottom**

So here on /r/cars, there is this endless debate over crossovers versus sedans, what their perceived advantages and disadvantages are, and why one would buy a crossover over a sedan. Well today, I thought I’d dig deep into the crossover vs sedan comparison, and I’ll dig deep into comparing the Ford Fusion and the Ford Edge, two midsized cars made by the same company on the same platform.

So first of all, let’s look at Fuel economy: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=39545&amp;id=39296&amp;id=39552&amp;id=39299

A FWD Fusion gets 1mpg better than a FWD Edge with the same engine. AWD Fusions and Edges get the same fuel economy. So obviously fuel economy isn’t a concern when choosing between the two.

On paper, it is possible to get Fusions for cheaper. The lowest MRSP for a Fusion is $22,840 while the Edge starts at $29,315. However, the cheapest Fusion is equipped to a much lower standard than the cheapest edge (steel wheels, 2.5L naturally aspirated engine, etc) than the cheapest Edge. A mechanically identical Fusion and Edge are nearly identical in price (2.0L Ecoboost AWD SEL Trim), with the Fusion being $32,165 and the Edge being $32,040. 

Now from a size perspective, the two cars are nearly identical. Fusions are 191.7 inches long, and 72.9 inches wide, while Edges are 188.1 inches long (2 row version) and 75.9 inches wide. So yeah, the Fusion is 3 inches longer while the Edge is 3 inches wider. When it comes to parking and maneuverability, I don’t think the two would be much different, as they have nearly identical footprints.

The big difference comes down to practicality. Passenger wise, the Edge gets you a solid 113.9 cubic feet of passenger volume, while the fusion only has 102.8 cubic feet. The Edge gets better head and shoulder room on both the front and second rows. When it comes to leg room, the Fusion wins with 2 more inches of front leg room, but the Edge has 2 more inches of rear leg room. 

Now when it comes to practicality, the Edge wins, and by a long shot. You get 39.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the 2nd row, while the Fusion only gets 16 cubic feet of space in the trunk. The Edge also becomes significantly more useful once you put down the 2nd row, while the fusion doesn’t improve by too much due to the trunk opening design.

Now the Fusion does win in 1 way, acceleration. The 2.7L Ecoboost Fusion makes it to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds, while the 2.7 Ecoboost Edge does it in 5.6. (Numbers from Car and Driver). Aside: how does the Edge get the same fuel economy despite more weight? Probably due to gearing, which contributes to worse acceleration

Shocking however, the Edge does not lose to the Fusion in handling. The best handling Fusion is the Fusion Sport, which corners at 0.84g, while the Edge Sport with the identical drivetrain corners at 0.83g. The standard Fusion Sport takes 178 feet to stop from 70mph to 0, a number the Edge, well, edges out the competition at 176 feet. Why did the Fusion lose to the Edge? The Edge Sport comes with 245s, while the Fusion Sport comes with 235s. Now Ford Performance does offer a tire upgrade to performance summer tires, allowing the Fusion Sport to pull 0.89g on the skidpad and stop from 70mph in 155 feet (again, performance data from Car and Driver). 

But here’s the thing with the performance numbers, the Fusion sport is $40,910 (without the optional performance tires), while the Edge Sport is $38,765. So you’re paying $2000ish for a car that accelerates better, but doesn’t brake or turn better. I’m pretty sure however, the Fusion’s advantage is fleeting, as next year once the Edge ST comes out, it should at least match the Fusion Sport’s performance in every way around the same price.

So yes, I fully understand why Edge sales are soaring every year, while Fusion sales are declining (and won’t see a next generation). The Edge is just blatantly a better car in every single regard besides acceleration, where the top trim fusion that’s $2000 more expensive is better (and the upcoming Edge ST might beat). 

Now I get it, the Edge is one of the better mid-sized SUVs, while the Fusion is around the middle of the pack when it comes to midsized sedans, but I think the same conclusion is playing out in dealerships of every single brand, where the crossover is beating the sedan in either every single aspect or maybe just losing a bit when it comes to performance figures while winning significantly in practicality at around the same price or just with a small premium. 

And this is why I don’t personally lament the death of the family sedan. The average family sedan is just a meddling, mediocre product, designed to get you from A – B, while the modern crossover is a much better way to get from A – b, with more head and shoulder room, alongside better practicality at a minimal performance and fuel economy loss. 

PS: What about wagons? Well considering that the Mondeo Estate and the Fusion Sedan are the same car outside of the 5th door, all my above conclusions still hold, since although the Mondeo Estate has slightly better practicality, the Edge still easily beats it. According to Ford UK, the Edge can load 800 liters with both rows up, the Mondeo Estate can only do 525 liters with both rows up.  

**TL;DR: The Edge is better than the Fusion in interior space and practicality, while being nearly identical in size, price, handling, and fuel economy. The only place where the Fusion is better than the mechanically identical Edge is acceleration.**"	cars

Somewhere around 450-500bhp and 600Nm at the moment, and all to the front wheels.

Still I found myself quite surprised at how violent and brutal it felt like, almost like the turbo-nutters from the 80's. I know it's supposed to have Ford Revo-knuckle and some clever diff-trickery, but it was quite hard to notice since it actually felt like fighting a heavyweight boxer. Loads of fun tho.

Sexist?  I agree the salesman was gathering info and trying to deduce if she was actually serious but it was very very soon into the meet and greet..normal? 	cars
3311	When will manuals be gone?	"Ever since I was a kid I wanted a manual car, my first car was a 2012 dsg gti because the price was too good to pass up and my parents wouldnt let me get a manual. I valeted for a little bit and learned stick, the lust was becoming insatiable. Last month I bought myself a 2016 gti S 3 door w/lp,pp  that was 6 speed, every day is fun and I'm learning. 

Headlines constantly pop up which upset me but not a big deal- no coupe gtis, no base performance pack etc typical vw stuff.

But some stuck out, no more manual audis, no manual on the new GT500, hr-v losing manual, chevy cruze loses manual, even the gti is going to be dsg only in Australia.

I just wonder - how much longer until they stop producing manual transmission cars? Audi in the US fought to keep them, but sales weren't good. Theres the arguement that this is mostly for the US, but soon things might change worldwide. With Europe pushing for higher emissions standards EVs will be taking over, even in the land where manuals reign supreme. 
A shame that most people see driving as point A to point B, and not something fun, or something to get engaged in. People are too busy browsing instagram and texting to see it as anything but a car.
Its not a good feeling, when I'm older and I want a nice newer car with a third pedal, it may not be there. "	cars

3321	Why did the Chevrolet low center drive never take off?	"I was watching [this favorite video of mine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9EPf8SJc2Q) showing how a differential works. When watching towards the end, the announcer talks about how putting the helical drive gear near the bottom of the differential housing allows for the hump in the floor to be removed.

I can get why the hump exists for modern compact cars, where even if it's front wheel drive it might have the exhaust pipes or transmission linkage, and why really low-riding cars would retain it, but why did so many pre-compact RWD ""boats"" a lá the Ford LTD still have the hump? Too expensive for retooling? Driveshaft bumping the road?"	cars

I've had the coupe for only a few thousand miles, but I couldn't be more satisfied with the balance of power and comfort. It has the 3.6 with 305hp, so passing is still a breeze, and cruising is comfortable.

My OBD reader told me it was a cylinder misfire, and considering I had other stuff to fix I just cleared the check engine light and decided to fix it later, but the light didn’t come back on, so I figured it was a glitch.

That is, until I drove up to around 12,000-13,000 feet of elevation last Sunday, and it came on with the same problem. I swapped the spark plug from the problem cylinder to the neighboring cylinder so that if it comes back on, I’ll be able to tell if the spark plug was the problem based on whether the cylinder that’s misfiring changes, in the meantime, has anyone else experience these problems driving at high elevations before?

3357	Got to drive a friend's 2017 Camaro ZL1 on track (vid link in text)	"Had the opportunity to drive a friend's 2017 Chevy Camaro ZL1 auto trans on track Sunday and I thought I'd do a little write up for anyone interested.   

First, I'd like to give a bit of driving experience background on myself, just so you know where my feedback is coming from. (If you don't GAF, just skip this paragraph).  I've been involved with track days and racing since 2003.  I've tracked several cars, including 2006 Lotus Elise, a 2003 Nissan 350Z, a 2011 Audi S4 and a 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera (current track car).  I attended Skip Barber 3 day and 2 day advanced racing schools, and raced NASA 944spec.  I've also raced karts and done a bit of autocross and rally cross.  None of this means I'm some great driver, just that I have a fair bit of experience.    

Sunday, we were at Grattan Raceway, Belding, MI, for a track day.  I couldn't resist so I asked my friend if I could drive his ZL1.  He agreed but wouldn't let me drive it with everything turned off (my normal preference), which I felt was understandable.  He said, ""it's like 90% turned off,"" or something to that effect.  I drove it in manual mode.  [Here's a vid he captured from the on-board vid system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGbKVFhnq10).  What I liked about the car (in no particular order):  

* Seats.  The seats are fantastic.  Comfortable and super supportive.  Nearly as supportive as full-on race seats but 10x more comfortable.   
* Power and torque is just seemingly endless.  Very addictive.
* Handling was very good.  Fairly predictable behavior, but just not what I would call perfect.  Although I don't know how much the nannies were interfering with it.    
* Steering feel is very good for a car as heavy as this.  A bit over-boosted but still has good feel.  
* HUD is so cool.  All cars should have a HUD.  

Not so great:  

* Weight.  It drives amazing well, but you can feel that weight in the corners.  
* Throttle.  This is the thing that really detracted from the whole experience.  I could not get a feel for the throttle.  It was the most non-linear throttle I've ever experienced in a sports car.  I'd apply 50% and the response was more like 30%.  Then 60% would be 40%.  And then 70% would be 70%.   Really kind of frustrating.  Maybe it was the nannies, or the transmission or something.  

TL;DR:  Fast.  Very fast.  But the throttle needs work.  

EDIT:  It's been mentioned that the electronic aids probably used a weird (IMO) throttle mapping.  That certainly makes sense.  Maybe that's how ""normal"" people like it?  I don't know.  But it wasn't anything I would personally enjoy at any time, street or track.  "	cars

I find this is not a very effective strategy at getting the price I think is fair.  Although I think it should establish credibility, it tends to just create a point of leverage for buyers to use against my asking price.  Nobody I have ever met discloses like I do.

Im not sure if this the right place for this but here goes.

So last sunday morning my beloved ""Pappa-tunturi"" which is a very classic 52 year old moped here in Finland was stolen and there was a witness to the theft. Now the thief was startled by the feller who saw him and he speeded away in his car with my moped halfway stuffed in. The dude who saw them said that it looked like a two colored Mercedes or a bit older American car. What i know for sure is that it is a sedan and what the backseat looks like as the thief didn't have enough time to pack it in.So im hoping that you automotive enthusiasts could help me identify the car and help me catch the bastard who stole the apple of my eye.

3399	Passed my theory test 1st try. Here’s some last minute tips for anyone taking theirs (UK)	"So I passed my theory test first try after going in with a small level of confidence. Here’s some tips:

1. I strongly recommend the £5 app. That’s all I used as revision and as long as you’ve completed every question on the mock tests, you’re pretty much guaranteed a pass on the multiple choice question. My actual test was literally so similar to a mock on the app I couldn’t help smile to myself after the first few questions.

2. When people say most of it is common sense, it genuinely is. Loads of the questions aren’t strictly to do with driving or are so obviously stupid scenarios that it’s clear what the answer would be. I think where people go wrong is differentiating between what you actually WOULD do and what the law and the DVSA think you SHOULD do. 
 
Here’s an example: 
When can you sound your horn?
1. For fun
2. After midnight
3. To warn someone of danger
4. To let somebody know you’re waiting outside

At first glance you might choose 4 because that’s ‘what you do’ when you arrive at someone’s house, but if you think for an extra second it’s obviously to warn someone of a danger. 

3. Actually reading the question helps because there’s a few ones designed to slip you up like when they slip ‘wouldn’t’ or ‘must not’ rather than would or must in the question.

4. Chill. You have an hour to answer questions that give you the answer. Take your time.

5. Hazard perception. It’s all CGI and extremely slow compared to the real life practise clips. You’ll spot the hazards so easily, just make sure when you spot it and click, you click again a second later to make sure you get some points. Loads of people worry you can’t click loads. I clicked up to 10 times on each clip. As long as you don’t click in an obviousky cheating pattern like once every second and you don’t go stupidly over board with the amount of clicks, you’ll be gold.

The car I'm putting in storage for sure needs a new water pump, transmission seals, weatherstripping, a lot of electrical work, and probably a whole bunch of other gaskets and seals replaced too. Would the students do good work? Would I be completely screwed if they end up breaking something else on the car? I also have another car that needs new brake lines and has been sitting for four years that I would like to send to the school to work on if they do good work.

3408	The Reality of Owning an Old German Super Sedan (My E55 Story)	" 

Hi all, this is my first post on Reddit! I've been lurking for a long time but finally decided to post something.

**Warning:** This is long, but I want to share as much as I can for someone looking to get into this stuff.

So we've all heard the stories on old German luxury cars. Some say they're the best things since sliced bread due to the depreciation (Tavarish), others say to avoid them like the plague (Scotty Kilmer). Personally, I think they're all right to a degree, since these cars vary so wildly in condition. If you find the right one, it can be awesome and rewarding. Get an example with 13 previous owners and a sketchy VIN history report, then yeah, you're *probably* going to have a bad time.

Around 14 months ago, I made the decision to plunge head first into the world of out-of-warranty German cruise missiles. The lease was ending on my Focus, and I had always lusted over the idea of going fast while getting my butt massaged for cheap. In retrospect, I had no business even thinking about getting an older car with high maintenance costs; the most I had ever done on a vehicle was change the oil. This was also going to be my **only** car. But I thought ""hey, all these people on the Internets are doing it, why cant I?"" So the search began.

I eventually settled on a 2003-2006 W211 chassis Mercedes E55 AMG. I chose this for a few reasons. 1) there is a *massive*community online for these things, and pretty much every problem has already been solved and documented on a forum. 2) this was one of the last ""easy"" AMG's to work on, as not many special tools are needed and most maintenance items are accessible without much hassle. And the biggest one, 3) these engines and drivetrains are known for being extremely reliable (my **only** car, remember?). There's a famous video of a 400k mile original engine E55 putting down similar power numbers to factory spec on a dyno. For really any car with that mileage, that's impressive. Oh yeah and it also had 469hp and 516 ft/lbs of torque bone stock. I was sold.

I found a fantastic example, a 2004 1-owner car with just under 100k miles. The only problem was... it was on the opposite side of the country. The car was in Seattle, I'm in Detroit. I had only ever bought one car in my life (the Focus at age 18) and had literally no idea what to do, but it looked *so damn good.* So naturally, I went to [Internet.com](https://internet.com/) and figured out what to do for buying a car site unseen. I had the dealer drive the car to a nearby Mercedes shop to have a PPI done. This is **absolutely critical** with these high-end luxury cars. You might visually see nothing wrong and have no CEL's, but there can be a whole lot wrong under the surface once the dealer-specific computers are plugged in. Everything checked out good, and once financing was set up (yes I'm young and dumb and financed an old site-unseen German car) I was ready to go.

A booked flight later and some hotels reserved (shout-out to those hotel rewards points) and I was in Seattle with my new baby. If you ever have the chance to do a cross-country road trip, **do it.** It was spectacular, especially while going through the mountains at \*insert expensive ticket here\* speeds. 2500 miles and 1 week later and I was home without the car missing a beat.

But anyways, getting to answering the question of why you're here: how much does it really cost to daily drive one of these things? Answer: **It's complicated.** Let me explain.

If you're going to directly compare this to the running costs of a similar year and mileage Corolla, it's no question; the AMG (or whatever you get) is going to be much more expensive. Go ahead, make Scotty Kilmer's day and buy the more reasonable car. There's nothing wrong with that! What Scotty won't tell you, though, is that these old super sedans *are a fucking blast.* Nothing puts a smile on your face like a ridiculously overpowered 4 door sleeper, especially when you start to realize there's not much on the road that's faster than you. Okay fine, maybe taking corners in an old Miata is more fun, but here in Michigan we don't have those things called ""corners.""

Being a person who had never really done much car maintenance/repairs before this, the E55 has been surprisingly enjoyable to work on. If you have some basic tools and a jack/jack stands, you can do most of the stuff yourself. These cars aren't that much different than anything else, and have enough room to get your hands where they need to be (unlike many modern engine bays). Parts aren't that expensive, as long as you don't pay the Mercedes tax. You can avoid this by using [www.fcpeuro.com](https://www.fcpeuro.com/) , as you can get OEM parts for a fraction of the dealer cost. The warranty is cool too. [www.mbworld.org](https://www.mbworld.org/) has lots of useful DIY's and other information, along with many other M-B specific forums. If you understand basic mechanics, you'll be fine. This car has essentially forced me to learn how to fix a car myself, as 1) it's my only car and 2) if I went to the dealership for every repair I would be living in a tent in a Detroit alley. My car would be cool though!

So onto the juicy numbers. In my exactly 1 year of ownership, I have put 27k miles on the car. My overall average MPG (60% highway 40% city) is about 17.5mpg on premium. I have been stranded 0 times (knock on lacquered interior wood trim).

And the fun stuff, the maintenance items. This is what I've done off the top of my head. Everything was done in my garage with basic hand tools and a jack with jack stands, other than the engine rear main seal since the whole trans had to be dropped.

* both motor mounts
* transmission mount
* valve cover gaskets
* breather cover RTV gaskets
* oil cooler housing seals
* heater control valve
* all brake pads and rotors (they're massive on this car, 8 piston front, 4 piston back, made by Brembo)
* crankshaft position sensor
* thrust arms (front control arms)
* lower ball joints
* outer tie rods
* stabilizer bar links
* spark plugs (takes 16!)
* intercooler water pump
* supercharger pulley belt
* alarm siren
* front wheel bearings and hubs
* alternator
* about 5 oil changes (every 5k miles)
* I also purchased an advanced MB-specific scan tool for \~$150 that allows me to read some dealer-level codes and do intermediate diagnostics.

In total, I have probably spent around $3k in maintenance on this car in my 1 year of ownership, and Lord knows how much in gas. The E55 runs great now and feels like it hasn't lost any of its 469 ponies.

Would I do it all again? *Hell yes.* I know, I know, it costs a lot to maintain and register and whatever, but this is one of those cars you can't imagine giving up. Could it just be an emotional attachment of some kind? Sure, but you forget about that every time you put your foot down. It's no Hellcat, but it's fun making Mustang owners mad when they get gapped by a 14 year old car with a mountain bike on the roof.

**TL;DR**, to conclude my ridiculously long first ever post, if you're looking to buy an old German super sedan, follow these steps:

1. Do your homework
2. Get a PPI from a dealer
3. Don't jump on the first car you see
4. Realize it's not a Corolla
5. Always keep an ""emergency fund"" for when that one expensive thing breaks
6. Wave goodbye to the Challenger SRT while your butt is being massaged... *in style*

3413	Trying to Crack the Code: More Power for the Mazda Skyactive Engines?	"I’ve read a ton of times people saying that if someone wants the Sky G 2.0 to make big-time horsepower, they’re insane. To an extent, they’re right. But, humor me just a bit in my speculation. 

The Sky-G has a weak rotating assembly and open deck block. The head and piston design has an ultra-high compression ratio and a piston cavity that was created to optimize efficiency, not horsepower. The designed focused on torque with an undersquare long stroke. Efforts to increase power result in knock and the computer cuts back on ignition timing. The Sky-G is also extremely sensitive to high temps, and there is a report of a piston exploding and taking out the two adjacent cylinders. The engine also does some weird stuff like keeping the intake valves open after the piston starts the exhaust stroke in order to “fool” the engine into thinking it has a lower compression ratio. 

So my question is, if we were able to “deactivate” the Skyactive engines, essentially turning them into square (or oversquare) 4-strokes, could they handle more power? What parts would be required to do so? How cost effective (if at all) would it be? 

This is all merely speculation, but I’d like to hear other’s thoughts and ideas on this matter. "	cars

So I recently got new tires on my '11 Mazdaspeed3 from Discount Tires.

I had already paid and needed tires, so I just said okay and let them do it. I drove the tires on some mountain roads and they are okay. Better than my worn out Yokohamas, but just okay.

Personally I would love to do a build. My example would be the Alfa Romeo 159 wagon, but put in an engine that matches the looks and add a suspension lift system so it can look pretty in the parking lot or on smooth roads, but be driveable and not scraping everywhere when dailying. When I estimate costs for that though, I realise I can buy something that's better, newer, etc. and the idea dies.

3441	Why does Cadillac still fall behind MB, Audi, and BMW in the large luxury section	"If you look up the new cadillac CTS coupe, either a render or concept that unfortunately was never brought to light, you can see a serious competitor to the BMW 6 and the MB SL. In my opinion its gorgeous. 

The CT6 sedan, proposed by Cadillac to be the S-Class killer, is compared to the likes of the A6, 5 series, and E class in most motoring magazines, but not the A8, 7 series or S class. 

Ill see far more Q7's, GL's, and X5's than I would an Escalade in the wealthier parts of NJ. 

We have the Audi Prologue and E-tron, the Mercedes Maybach 6, IAA, AMG GT, and BMW's 8 series gran coupe and X7. All beautiful with obvious design elements either currently placed into their regular production cars or definitely into their future lineup. Cadillac has produced some of the most extravagant and yacht-like concepts as well, the Cadillac Escala, Elmiraj, and Ciel, all cars you'd imagine could be fighting Rolls Royce, Bentley, and Maybach. 

They know what beauty is, yet they fail with cars like the CT6 and CTS, so much anticipation of ""Finally, a Cadillac model that will bring that name back to glory"" when you saw the concept of the model, yet when put into production you walk past it and its still a bland, chunky looking Cadillac. And when compared to the A6 and A8, E and S class, 5 and 7 series, the germans can still produce a car that's crisp and stunning. 

Cadillac sells less than half the volume of its competitors. I see ugly XT5s obviously built on the chevy equinox platform, fat XTS's, small unattractive base model ATS's, no CTS or CTS-V's, no CT6. Why is it that Cadillac underperforms, are they not capable, restricted by GM, underfunded or ill-equipped? Does their design department not care about their production cars as much as the concepts, or are they maybe two completely separated departments?

3446	'05 Honda Civic VP (non V-Tech) timing belt/head gasket replacement issues (2 broken sockets)...	"I am following [this](https://youtu.be/iAu6S3EQk5g?t=66) video series and was at the linked point in the process when, instead of the bolt coming free, the socket exploded in two and that was that. It was a cheapo HF one so I went and grabbed my good set of them aaaaand now I'm missing a socket from that set too. Same thing happened. I don't have air and really don't have the money for fancy shit (like, probably, a good air compressor, though I've never really priced them out), hence why I'm doing this job at home instead of getting it done (cars worth about 2-2.2k and repairs were quoted at 1.9k, plus the cars been nothing but headaches and I've already sunk at least 2k into it over the past year). 

What are my options? Do I need to just say to hell with it? Would one of those cheap $50ish electric impact wrenches work? Do I need to get a full air system and pneumatic impact drive? I'd like to spend under $100 more dollars on this since I've already bought all the parts and have it taken apart this much."	cars

3451	Welcome to the Salt Belt; my 2002 Explorer had a Class 1 hitch that was rotten through, heres how I upgraded it to a Class 3 for $25.	"More from the chronicles of projeckt Fr0d Expl0der!

On this wonderful 89 degree Michigan Summer day, I decided it was the perfect day to not only sweat out all of my fears and potentially die of dehydration, but also to solve a glaring issue that my cheap tow truck was suffering from.

It can't tow.

Why? because the trailer hitch is [*dangerously* rotten.](https://imgur.com/wSpbGuf) I can literally put my finger through it in multiple places. So what do we do? Well, my original solution was to order an upgraded Class 3 hitch from the likes of Uhaul, Curt, or Hidden Hitch. After reviewing the options and finding that all of them were hideously expensive ($150-$200) and none of them would go in place of the disgusting factory hitch that had experienced weight reduction by rust, I decided I wanted a factory hitch from a Mountaineer or a V8 Explorer. 

OFF TO THE DEALER I GO! 

After a brief (and I mean *brief*) visit to a local Ford Dealership on the east side of Detroit, I found 2 things. 1) good luck finding a new one, and 2) its likely going to be over $300 to find a new old stock factory Class 3 hitch. Fat chance; there is no way I am spending over 1/3rd of the cost of the vehicle on a trailer hitch so I can tow something behind this truck, explode the transmission, and cry until I feel better... (Homer Simpson voice) mmm expensive tears...

So, what do? WELP! Time to bust out the Home Depot/Husky Mechanics tool set, and make the long trek to 8 Mile road in the D (thats Detroit... We call Detroit ""the D"", I know... its terrible). This isn't a plug, but my favorite junk yard is Parts Galore, they have multiple locations around Detroit Metro but by far the best one is off of 8 Mile and Groesbeck Highway (M-97). It costs $1 to get in, and they have *tons* of vehicles to pick from, they also do a stellar job of updating their inventory right on the website, when I checked they said they had 8 Ford Explorer/Mountaineers between 2002-2007 in the yard, and they were 100% correct, and every one of them was within a city block of each other, which made it extremely easy to locate what I was looking for.

The first hitch I found happened to be just as rotten as the one on my truck, but a quick 180 degree turn and I find another 2002 Ford Explorer with a *mint* and completely rust free Class 3 hitch with 6 prong electrical connector and wiring harness/cover that was complete and undamaged, SCORE. 

Removal was easy...ish. the bolts were 15mm on the junk yard truck, but having no access to pneumatic tools, and forgetting my breaker bar, I was limited to the tools I could bring and whatever I could find in the junkyard. The bolts were *tight*, supremely tight. My 1/2 Inch Husky ratchet just didn't have the leverage to break it free, laying underneath this explorer happened to be a short length of 2.5 inch exhaust pipe, so, [I helped myself to a free breaker bar](https://imgur.com/bi4BOvo).

Within minutes the spectacular class 3 hitch was free from its grave yard mountings, ready for a new lease on life on another rusty piece of junk, a quick scour around the donor vehicle and a I find a window trim that I also needed for my truck.

I approach the Cashier with my prize, dumping it onto the counter and leaving a happy little customization (dent) in the steel that it was made out of. The Cashier looked at my, curious, ""what is that?"" she asked me, curious about what I had just discovered during my archaeological dig.   

""its a tail light bulb"" I said with a stupid grin on my face.

The cashier laughed, knowing I was trying to pull a fast one on her, since tail light bulbs are $2 there. 

""really, what is it?"" she asked. I answered honestly (having already looked at he prices for the parts on their website) ""its a Hitch receiver."" 

""AH! thats $25 with a $6 core, cash or card?"" I happily gave her my credit card, she rang me up and threw in the window trim for free.

Time to install; removal of the rear bumper revealed the severity of the condition, I was actually stunned to find that [this had supported my weight in the past](https://imgur.com/gmazK9Z). It was [*bad*](https://imgur.com/O7m5GHO). Welp! out with the old and [in with the new](https://imgur.com/FKPQJC2). 

Even before the bumper was fitted the hitch looked 1000 times better, no pictured here I did happen to undercoat the new hitch, everywhere but the exposed areas, I wanted it to look stock still but be protected from the elements, and [here it is all done!](https://imgur.com/C2gU9Xu)

After this whole ordeal I had 2 hours of my time and $25 of cash invested into the upgrade, and now I have a truck that is capable of towing at its full capacity (5000 pounds) rather than the 0 pounds that the dangerous factory hitch was offering, I was impressed to even find that the factory wiring was compatible with the upgraded hitch and 6 plug RV connector which supports electric brakes that are built into the trailer. Definite win for the day, and the holiday weekend, the next big fix for this truck before winter hits is getting the 4 wheel drive working again, with a surprisingly inexpensive fix.

Until next time! 


**TL;DR - I bought a replacement hitch for my Explorer, it was $25, stop being lazy and read the rest.** "	cars

I moved from Texas to NY a couple months ago, pulling about 1,000 lbs. The transmission fluid did not need to be flushed at that time, but I was advised to flush it after the move. This is a high priority for me, as maintenance is vital if I want to get my baby to 200,000, but I'm struggling with finances after the expensive move and have been putting other financial priorities ahead of it.

The last few weeks, I can feel something different. The car's engine purr/hum/vibration/steady noise/whatever you call it, seems less smooth. No jitters, but... When driving or idling, it feels slightly rougher, and I have a feeling in my gut that there's something wrong with my car.

Is this a sign of the transmission fluid needing to be flushed? Or something else? Can I put it off a couple more weeks, or do I need to take care of it right now?"	cars

I am in desperate need of help trying to identify the make/model/year of 2 vehicles that were recently involved in a vandalism of my property. I would rather not focus on that side of the story but rather work towards identifying the vehicles.

I luckily caught everything on security camera so have a pretty general idea about the cars they were driving.

3459	Just saw first Alfa Romeo Stelvio, why did it have black smoke coming from the exhaust?	"I was walking my dog and a Stelvio rolls by, this is a flat section of the neighborhood and they were going 25 mph (40 Kph) at most so not giving any throttle really. As it went by I noticed black smoke coming from the exhaust, worse than I see when cars from the 70s go by, and nearly as bad as a two-stroke! I wonder if there was a misfire or something, I thought the engine sounded strange, but at such low speed I could hardly hear the engine idling down the road. This isn't just water vapor, as it was a sunny 90F (32C) day at the time. 

How can such a new vehicle, with such strict modern environmental regulations, smoke that bad? Is it supposed to do this? I have a hard time understanding why VW got so much attention when this gasoline Alfa smokes worse than any VW diesel I've ever seen. If it is intentionally designed I am not sure how it can pass any emissions testing. Or is the FCA build quality that bad that a two-year-old max luxury vehicle could have engine troubles so soon into ownership?"	cars

3465	I seriously need some help eliminating rattles in my exhaust. 2017 Subaru WRX	Before I post this, I have already submitted a post to /r/WRX for help and they gave me virtually no advice so I'm coming here to /r/cars since this isn't a WRX specific issue. Just over half a year ago, I got a catless jpipe installed which came with a mid pipe and had the rest custom fabricated. Bolts that held the midpipe and rest of the exhaust together rattled out so I had all the sound coming out from beneath the car. I ordered a new flat flange, screwed some locknuts onto the new bolts to ensure they didn't rattle out again and figured that was it. Well, something is still rattling. It only happens when I'm accelerating. Not at neutral and not revving it at neutral. It rattles during decel as well. I want to say the flat flange in between the two pipes is what's rattling but it was perfectly flush and I used a torque wrench to bolt the pipes together until I couldn't turn it anymore. Those pipes are bolted together extremely tightly but something is still rattling. Given that it only rattles when I drive, I can't really pinpoint what's rattling. It's kind of hard to investigate a strange sound from the undercarriage when the vehicle is moving. Anyone have any idea what might be causing the rattle? It doesn't sound or smell like there's an exhaust leak and I haven't gotten any CEL or anything like that so I'm beyond confused. 	cars

3469	Of the sedans of the 2000s, which would have looked better / equally as good in coupe form?	"Having seen an [Infiniti G37 Coupe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg/180px-2008-Infiniti-G37-Sport.jpg) the other week, this had me thinking about which sedans [that didn't offer a coupe option] would have looked just as good, or better in coupe form.

For me, I'd have probably liked to have seen a coupe version of:

**Hyundai Sonata NF (2004-2009)** [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/06-08_Hyundai_Sonata.jpg). If it was a coupe, I expect Hyundai would have sold it only with the 3.3-liter/237hp V6, and only in CDX [ (later CDX+ trim level ], or for the U.S. and Canada, Limited spec. The 2004-2010 Sonata looked good for a mid-size sedan.

**Mazda 6 (2007-2012)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg/420px-Mazda_6_front_20090212.jpg). OK, so there hasn't been a 626 Coupe for years, but the Mazda 6's fluid lines would adapt well to a coupe model. If there was a coupe model, it would probably have been available in Touring and Grand Touring spec, with the 3.7-liter/272hp V6 petrol.

**Ford Falcon BA (2002-2005)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg/300px-2002-2004_Ford_Falcon_%28BA%29_XR6_sedan_%2818731328968%29.jpg). This one is one of my favorite generations of this classic Australian sedan. If there was a coupe, I expect it'd have a choice of three versions - XR6 with the 4.0-liter/244hp 6-cylinder, XR6 Turbo with the 4.0-liter/320hp 6-cylinder turbo and XR8 with the 5.0-liter/350hp V8 Boss 260 engine.

Although, saying that, I actually got my wish to have this version, in a way, as [Australian company Dreamtech built one](https://www.qt.com.au/news/the-coupe-ford-never-built/707321/) with the 5.4-liter/350hp V8 Boss 350 engine and a supercharger. It looks so awesome, I like this one.

**Subaru Legacy BL/BP (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg/1920px-Subaru_Legacy_B4_BL.jpg). I already like this sedan and stationwagon anyway, but imagine there being a 2.0-liter/279hp twin-scroll turbo model in GT Spec B version as a sporty coupe. I know there was the Impreza STi in coupe form, but this... it could have been pretty good!

**Audi A8 D3 (2003-2009)**: [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg/420px-2003-2005_Audi_A8_%284E%29_4.2_quattro_sedan_%282011-01-05%29.jpg). I've always liked the A8, one of the most stately and impressive full-size sedans.

If there was a coupe, I expect it'd be a quattro model with a choice of the 4.2-liter/335hp V8 [ (later the 4.2-liter/345hp V8) ] and the 5.2-liter/444hp V10 FSI engines for the S8 model.

There actually *was* an Audi A8 coupe, [as this article from motorauthority.com shows](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1111462_meet-the-audi-a8-coupe-you-didnt-know-existed), but that was based on the first-generation D2 model, and was from 21 years ago.

Imagine the Audi S8 as a trackday coupe - good idea or bad idea?

3486	How to bluff convincingly about virtually any car	"I'm interested in the ""bluffer's line"" for your car: essentially, something that only people who have owned the car for many years, or pushed it frequently to its limits, or hung around for too long in its subcultures, would know about.

I'll start with my mini-stable:

CLS63 AMG (W218): It really needs the limited-slip diff and it is baffling why AMG did not make this standard equipment. It was only available as an option in the ""S"" version, and Merc will not retroactively fit one to standard 63s. Quaife offer an aftermarket diff that is highly rated in the community.

TVR Cerbera: If the handbrake is too weak, seven times out of ten, it's because you're too weak. The [bizarre layout of the cabin](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2000-TVR-Cerbera-Pictures-c10970?picturesTabFilter=INTERIOR) means that the handbrake is almost at shoulder level, and very difficult to get a good pull on.

The tl;dr version is that I'm looking for someone with a newer-generation EV who also has a meter at his 240v plug, so we can determine how much electricity is lost when the car is being charged.

**The long version**

The newer EVs have screens that, among other things, will tell you how much electricity you used to go X distance. They will give you fuel economy numbers, typically expressed in miles/kWh and sometimes in equivalent miles per gallon, a/k/a mpg-e.

The problem with these displays is that they omit the considerable EV charging losses. I have seen charging loss estimates ranging from 15% to 25%. So, when I'm doing various analyses, I will use 20% as the charging loss number, but I'm not confident of it. The only way to really know would be to spend \~$100 on an EKM Metering meter, placed right smack next to your 240v plug. This would tell you how much juice you used between charges. Compare that to what your in-car display says, and *voila!* you would have the charging loss. Oh, and you'd have the actu*al electricity use, which you can use to find your EV'*s true fuel economy.

I like my little 2011 Think City battery operated grocery getter, but I regard it as a car and not a cause. And it lacks an onboard fuel economy readout. If I want to know its true electricity consumption and fuel economy (and I do!), then I *must* have a meter next to the plug. I always want the real numbers, and always tell everyone else the good, the bad, and the ugly. So: Are there any EV owners here who measure their car's consumption at the plug with a meter? (Incidentally, this is how the EPA does it when calculating EV fuel economy.) If so, I am *very interested* in working with you to determine the charging loss.

Thanks much. Apologies in advance to those for whom this is pathetically OCD. Hey, folks, once an analyst always an analyst. It's what we are."	cars

3494	Does anyone elses enjoyment of driving get diminished by having to commute to and from work through heavy traffic everyday?	"When I bought my Celica about a year ago I worked at a local company which I could easily reach by public transport and I didnt have to rely on my car. Back then I had immense fun driving since I could chose when and where to drive on my own terms. Most of my kilometers on the odometer back then were from nightly joyrides on the Autobahn or through curvy backroads with no other cars in sight, just me and my machine.

About two months ago I had to switch jobs and got a new job in a different town about 40 kilometers from where I live which is difficult to reach by public transport, so for the first time I had to rely on my car to get me to and from work every day. To make matters worse there is currently a ton of roadwork on the Autobahn which I have to use every day, which means at least one of three lanes is blocked, so most of my time is spent creeping at 30 kph behind trucks. I need about an hour for those 40 km, which should tell you about the speed I can go at.

This all but has completely killed my enjoyment of driving. Instead of sitting down behind the wheel with a smile on my face as I turn on my car I loathe having to take that commute everyday. Not to mention having to pay super close attention to fuel economy and probably having my rates raise up from increased km/year.

Maybe this is just a whiny rant, but does anyone else feel that way? Right now I feel like I'd rather go back to public transport, even if it would take me longer than being stuck in traffic.

Does driving need to be enjoyable?"	cars
3495	Girlfriend Lost Control and Wrecked ‘13 TSX Trying to Avoid a Deer. Totaled??	"Driving my car down the parkway to get to work around 7:00 this morning my girlfriend had a deer run out in front of her. She tried swerving to avoid it, looks like she couldn’t stop the understeer and went full General Lee flying over a roughly 10’ grass ramp acting as the median right into the other side of traffic. Thankfully it was early and there was no oncoming traffic but she got a lot of air and came down hard. Steering wheel and passengers side curtain airbags deployed. She’s okay albeit pretty bruised and will be sore for a while, definitely the best possible outcome safety wise. (Picture below of the sick Acura logo brand she got when the airbag deployed) 

[Acura Brand As Promised](http://cubeupload.com/im/Hubersglutes/1C81EF4D2D4E44628A6A.jpeg) 

I haven’t been able to look at the car yet as the tow yard is closed for Labor Day but have seen the pics she sent me. Will go on Tuesday with the appraiser. Front and rear bumpers both damaged, rear drivers side tire blew, bent rim, maybe brake damage. Several scuffs and scrapes around the entire vehicle. Since I haven’t gotten to see it I’m assuming the worst so far as the suspension etc. 

Cars worth around 12K. My research is saying the airbags alone could be almost half of that. I think KY requires 75% of value in damages to total a vehicle. I’m thinking it’ll be totaled. What do you guys think? 

Also side note: I never realized how little I could care about damage to the car just knowing she’s safe. Like holy shit this could’ve been sooo much worse.

3498	Are my 5 year old tires due for a change? - 06 Acura TL	"I have an 06 Acura TL - Automatic. Currently running Yokohama 580 for all 4 tires, 6/32 (front) and 9/32 (rear). The tires are however 5 years old and show some cracking on the inside but I am unsure if there's any issues/cracking at the side wall.
Here are some pics
https://imgur.com/a/WyIoq2F

I believe the previous owner of the car put ~5000 miles on them and I put maybe ~10000 or less over 18 months (I ran chinese Milestar tires in the winter but then blew a sidewall in a giant pot hole)

I realize the tires are old and I do plan on replacing them especially before the winter comes (I live in the midwest). I'd prefer to go with name brand all season tires and ~$400-$500 installed if possible. I drive 5000-10000/year or less (mostly highway 55-75 mph)

My local discount tire has some cheap no name brand tires on their website which I don't trust but when I went to the physical store they tried to sell me some $700 continentals. Since I don't drive much ( I may drive less than 5000 miles on certain years if I end up relocating ) what are some good options for me? Rebates, etc. Should I replace only the front tires since the rear still have plenty of tread?

3502	2018 Chevrolet Malibu Premier Review: Better than an Audi?	"So a few days ago, I was really bored, and after reading a bunch of media reviews of the new Chevrolet Malibu, I decided to go check one out. I was at my local ford dealer getting an oil change, and well, I decided to pop over next door to see what the Chevrolet dealer had, and after chatting a bit with the salesman, and saying that I want something ""sportier but 4 door"", the guy pulled up a loaded Malibu and told me to get in.

So the car I'm talking about is loaded, with a canada exclusive ""Premier True North Edition"", with all the driver assistance tech and 19 inch wheels. Sticker price was $37 thousand (CAD) and change, but after factory incentives and adding AC tax and destination the car was around 34 thousand and change (building an identical car on the chevy website got me $34,700)

So the Malibu I sat in was black exterior, black interior, and black bowtie, essentially everything that could be black was black. The premier trim gets you LED DRLs, and LED tail lights. I hate black cars, but putting that aside, I have to say, the Malibu is a bit of a butterface. The front isn't great, but the side profile and rear is pretty handsome, and the sloping, coupe like roofline does look pretty good. But the front, ugh, the split grille isn't to my liking, and even in the top trim, the non-drl lights are still halogen and not LED, kinda disappointing for a loaded car in 2018 (especially since the tail is full LED).

On the inside, the black interior color probably hides a lot of the cheaper materials used, but it looks totally fine. The seats could be a little bit softer, and there's some weird wood trim on the door and around the shifter, but the materials used is mostly OK. The mirrors auto dim, and are heated, but unfortunately, the rear view mirrors don't fold electronically I believe. The steering wheel feels nice and meaty, but I don't particularly like the membrane buttons. The air vents are angled weirdly, but you can still get the air to blow at your face. Heated and vented front seats complete the package, and were much appreciated during the test drive. 

The infotainment is nice, smooth, and fast. The screen is pretty bright, and from my experience with a few FM stations, the audio is more than competent. You get 4G LTE, alongside carplay and android auto, there's also a wireless charging pad that I really like. 

On the road, the Malibu is surprisingly good. The chassis is brilliant, as the car really handles like it is a few hundred pounds lighter than you expect (apparently, depending on config, the Malibu starts at 3,084, which is much lighter than the competition). The suspension is a weakpoint, as it does mildly dive a bit when you push it and there is a bit of body roll. The salesman did mention that Chevy offers a factory upgraded suspension, which according to the website actually lowers your car (aside: factory slammed Malibus are a thing now?). Steering is acceptable, the ratio is quick enough, and the power steering is boosted to an acceptable, but not overboosted level. There is some torque steer if you floor the car, but not really if you're really gentle with the throttle. 

The drivetrain is above average for its class for sure. The GM turbo 4 is a very good engine, torque hits you like a wall. Lag is a bit more noticable than ford Ecoboosts, but I have a feeling it would be better on premium gas. The engine is for the most part quiet, no perceivable engine vibration could be felt in the seats and the broad torque curve was pretty damned nice for day to day driving. Transmission wise, the transmission for the most part shifts smooth, but the new 9 speed could use a bit of tuning maybe, on low speed city roads it hunts for gears occasionally. 

Overall, the Malibu is more than OK, and for 34 thousand ish canadian bucks. As a comfortable, daily, family sedan, Malibus are a good option despite some of my nitpicks (Halogen headlights, bad front end design, odd interior design). 

Is it better than an Audi though? Hmm, well, I think its better than the Fusion, Altima, Mazda 6, and Camry for sure. Maybe the Accord is better? hard to say without more driving. But price for price, I'd 100% take the Malibu before I take the similarly priced FWD A3, and I'd prefer the malibu even to the FWD a4 that's $5000 more. 

I do feel that GM could potentially have a home run in their hands if they bring back the Malibu SS. Up the power a bit to ~270 hp like in the Camaro, add in Buick's Hi-per-strut, maybe add an AWD system, and Chevrolet might actually have a hit on their hands. The chassis is actually quite good, after all, the Malibu is a midsized that weights like a compact, its even ~400lbs lighter than a FWD A4 while being a whole size class up!

3520	Questioning my ability to drive my car these days (RPM hang).	"I won't lie, I'm a bit reluctant to post this due to how judgmental most people tend to be...We'll see how this goes.

​

As the title states, I'm starting to question my ability to drive my car. This could possibly entirely all in my head. I drive a 2018 WRX MT (duh). As a lot of manual drivers know, modern cars have RPM hang. I generally shift around 3k RPM because I don't see a reason to drive faster. However, if I shift from say 2 to 3rd (or 3 to 4, 4th to 5th is VERY noticable), I can tell I'm generally shifting too fast as my RPMs drop when I release the clutch. It's not a jerky feeling, it's actually REALLY smooth. It's just that 600-800RPM difference I assume is putting stress on the flywheel as the speed of the engine and road are differential? On the flipside, if I wait a bit...the RPMs jump up a bit (200-400 RPM) because I'm waiting too long. I release the clutch slowly and don't dump it.

I know most younger drivers can careless about improving their ability, but I am not one. I want my car to last and I want to be able to pass on good traits.

I would GREATLY appreciate any input to improve. I've been told to shift at higher RPMs but that just seems to lead to needing to wait more...Thanks"	cars

If you have an accident, and the unibody was bent out of shape (on the side or the front), does the car basically become scrap metal? Is there any reason you could justifiably keep using the car, since it will no longer protect you in an accident even after repair? It seems like in the event that you're in a car crash, your car will basically become worthless: It's foolish to keep driving it and it would be unethical to sell it to someone else who would drive it.	cars
3538	Doors falling off 1996 Dodge Dakota (Help Question)	"Hello friends I have a bit of an odd question for a problem I have never encountered in any older model truck before. 

I own a 96 Dodge Dakota.  Perfect condition, runs great, I love my little truck.  Since buying the truck both doors, driver and passenger have broken in the same way and I'm curious if anyone knows a solution to this problem or has encountered it before.

On both doors, the bottom hinge of the door has broken completely through the frame of the door.  When you close the door, the hinge doesn't rotate anymore it literally just pushes itself -into- the frame of the door where it has broken a hole around it.  

On the drivers door I tried to have a mechanic weld it, and he did a shit job and burned a hole through the door and turned the hinge into slag.  That one I've resigned myself to simply replacing the entire door with one from a salvage yard (If I can ever find one).  

The Passenger side door is only slightly damage at this time and I'm curious if anyone has ever encountered this type of failure before that might have some solutions on how to fix it?  Or how to prevent it from happening again when I get a new door to install.  "	cars

3549	Is the 2011 Nissan Juke transmission failing?	"My dad got a 2011 Nissan Juke when it came out because it was ""the first of its kind"" and it was just the perfect fit for his budget (my parents also liked the looks wuuuuut). It has about 118k mi.

Anyway, I have been driving this car for college and I've noticed a few things weird with the car. For one, it vibrates when I go over 63~ mph, and the vibration gets stronger the faster I go. Like, my body goes up and down, the steering wheel sorta shakes, etc. 

Second, it takes a little too long to switch gears, and when it does, it gives off a tiny but noticeable jerk. I wait like 1-2 seconds for the tranny to switch from reverse to drive, etc. 

Third, sometimes, the Juke is too slow to accelerate. I'm in stop and go traffic, and sometimes the car  just feels much slower than usual, despite the normal revving noise I'd expect when accelerating in S&amp;G traffic. Could it be because I decided to fill the car with premium once and went back to regular?

Also, the fuel mileage is pretty bad. I got about 22-23 mpg on mixed SG and highway driving. Could it also be because I mixed premium with regular? I don't believe I drive like a maniac, like, I don't accelerate harder than cars around me, and if there are no cars around me, I sometimes let go of the pedal so that I won't have to use the brakes as much.

3555	Mustang for Fiesta ST...now I get it	"Hi everyone! After being on the fence about trading in my 2011 Mustang for a semi-hot hatch, I finally took the plunge. 

I was looking at the used market for the Focus ST, MK7 GTI, and Fiesta ST. I looked the idea of the GTI but future maintenance scared me away. The used market for the Focus ST was a little too high and then I found a certified pre-owned Fiesta ST with every option available for under 15k and I took that as a sign from the universe. 

My mustang was only a V6 but it was optioned exactly like I wanted: Premium Leather, performance package and glass roof (pretty rare). It was tough to move on from the Mustang but I needed a little more usable space (no kids but 2 pets). The dealer tried to low ball me on the trade initially for 7k and we eventually got to a number I was comfortable. We ended up on 9.5k plus I would save 500 in taxes; blue book had the Mustang from 10-11k and my car was very clean with be tires and brakes all around. Unfortunately, it had bubbling paint on the hood which the S197 generation is notorious for and they stuck to giving me a little less the excellent trade in value. 

Long story short, the moment I drove the Fiesta ST, I was hooked. It just felt right. The Mustang always felt bigger than it needed to be while the Fiesta ST's proportions felt balanced. I'm not the biggest guy (5'8) and the Recaros hugged me just right. On the highway, I could pass while in 6th gear while the Mustang would struggle in 5th gear and forget about 6th gear. 

The Fiesta felt like the iconic cars from the 90's that I grew up idolizing. Let this be advice for anyone looking to get into a hot hatch: You don't need the biggest or fastest to have fun!"	cars

The closest one I found that still had one in stock was asking $58,091. Has anyone seen a Civic Type R for a higher price, or is that the new record? For comparison, I decided to search for similarly priced cars, and here are the local competitors in that price bracket: 


2018 C-Class AMG C43 for $59,000

2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia for $58,835 

2018 Chevy Camaro ZL1 for $55,950

2018 Ford Focus RS for $55,414 (SERIOUSLY STILL???)

2018 Dodge Charger SRT 392 for $48,777

2018 Infiniti Q50 Red Sport (400hp) for $45,491

2018 Nissan 370Z Roadster for $47,995

2018 Chevy Camaro 1LE (455hp) for $49,900


Or, you can go buy a new Civic Type R on ebay for $10k-$20k less. 

Edit: fixed 370Z price.

3567	Upgraded my daily driver this week. I’m excited to see what torque feels like!	"After owning a 2017 BRZ for almost two years, I thought it was still the perfect car for me. I modified it for track duty (header, tires, brakes, coils,etc) and it was still totally compliant for daily use. I saw a used ISF go up for sale at a local dealer and I was always curious how they drove. With no intentions to buy one, I took it for a spin and was instantly hooked. It was very comfortable, great handling, and the motor is so smooth and sounds godly when the intake flap opens. This always sat in the back of my mind and I told myself whenever I needed to upsize to 4 doors, the ISF will be my car of choice. 

Well, the time has come where I need more room and I can’t say I’m disappointed! I’ll definitely miss the BRZ since it was so well balanced and very lightweight. It taught me how to drive on the track and never had issues. Although, the ISF is in another level in terms of speed and comfort. I found this 2009 ISF with 80k miles in California and had it shipped over to Arizona as there was not one for sale here in decent shape. No rust, no accidents, and in very good shape. Hopefully I will take this to an HPDE event once or twice over the winter to see its capabilities until I have room for a track dedicated car.

3572	Fixing issues as soon as they appear vs. waiting until they get serious?	"So I recently got into an argument with my mother and her fiancé about how to treat minor issues with a car which could become troublesome later down the line.

I own a 203.000 km Toyota Celica and it is starting to show its age. Recently, the transmission has started whining around certain speeds (around 50-70 kph), indicative of differential pinion gear wear. It might also leak a little bit of oil and the dampers are slowly losing their power, making the ride even less comfortable than it already was. Also the chassis in general is starting to get creaky and I am sure the clutch release bearing is starting to wear down as well, as there is a rattling noise whenever I engine-brake.

Now I showed all those issues to the fiancé of my mother, who has driven everything from tiny subcompacts over big trucks to even a tank in his life and he told me to stop worrying. All those things are simply indicative of an old car and should not concern me yet, it will still run for another 50.000 km at least and until then I will have found a new car.

My mother owns a 198.000 km VW Lupo (a city car with 50 HP for those unaware because I dont think its being sold in murica) and its an absolute shitbox. Whenever I drive it (rarely) I feel like it could fall apart at any moment. The clutch is super fucked, the shifter is the most wobbly thing in the world and the transmission and suspension rattles to hell and back. But my mother doesnt care. She only drives it for about 12 km a day from work and back and to the grocery store every week and it has yet to fail her. 

Both of them tell me to not worry so much about my car and that if I would give in to my worries every time I would probably visit the mechanic every single month, but I just want my car to last as long as possible and feel great driving it. I cant afford to simply send it to a mechanic right now either because I need to to get to work and back (80 km everyday). 

Who is in the right here? Should I worry and try to fix those ""minor"" issues ASAP or should I learn to live with the wear and tear of an old car?"	cars

Literally nearly every car journalist and review has complained about the engine and it's lack of power. I'm sure they are more than well aware that their market wants a more powerful version of the car. Yet Subaru releases the BRZ tS, in which they improved nearly every other performance attribute, except for the engine, which is by far the most complained about, most lacking and underwhelming aspect of the car? They're not dumb. They know that the engine is the worst part about the car. They know that this is what the consumers want. Common business sense would be release a more powerful version of the car. Yet it's been 6 years and they have stubbornly refused to and I can't figure out their reasoning. Why are they doing this?"	cars

3611	Changing my oil for the first time	"I was wanting to start changing my own oil and thought I'd check in and get some advice.  I just bought some 3 ton jack stands, an oil pan, and a funnel.  I found a deal on some Mobile 1 High Mileage 5 qt synthetic 5-W30 oil and a Mobile 1 oil filter.  Well I was reading more and saw here and there that its recommended to change the drain plug gasket with every or every other oil change.  I've never heard of this.  Should I be doing this?  Also, when looking at my manual for my car it mentions I need to use   oil meeting GM standard GM6094M.  I also didnt know about this.  My vehicle is a 2006 Pontiac Torrent.  Is this an outdated standard and should I be following it?  I looked up on Mobile's website and it says I should use a different oil to meet that standard.  I thought all I needed to look for was 5-W30 oil.  Am I way over-complicating this?  After all, its been getting 12 years of crappy oil at quick lube shops this whole time and all they have only ever mentioned was 5-W30 oil.  What are your thoughts?

Edit:  Should I be using Mobile 1 Extended Performance full synthetic oil since its supposed to be guaranteed for 1 year or 15,000 miles whichever comes first?  This oil is available on a similar deal and is only about $5 more and should theoretically last me a year instead of 6 months with what I have.  That oil does make the GM6094M spec.  I do have an engine oil life indicator on the dash that will light up when its time to change the oil.  Should I just follow that light for when to change the oil again?"	cars

3614	Random thought: People that drive older cars, do you also enjoy this?	"It's no secret that cars have gotten substantially bigger over time. Obviously I guess parking spaces have also adapted to the growth of cars. Personally, I tend to drive older cars. As such, sometimes I'll run into a compact car spot (often times they're situated in a way that you only have one car next to you or none, like there's protective barriers between spaces, so they're quite nice), snugly fit my car in the space, and smile. I just think it's funny how these formally normal-sized cars are the same size as today's ""compacts"" (sometimes smaller).

I guess this doesn't really apply to old American muscle cars though. Watching my dad and his '66 Continental is always amusing. "	cars

So basically just removing the hose altogether and completely off the BPV. Not sure if I make sense. I assume this hose is here to release excess air to avoid damaging the turbo? It sends it back into the intake. My car doesn’t have a MAF sensor. That I am aware of. It’s a 2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport with the 1.6t motor.  

My question is. Doing this won’t cause any damage? Isn’t the car expecting this air to come right back to it? Doesn’t this in turn affect boost as well?"	cars

3628	I need advice on what you do when a dealership has scammed me.	"I purchased a Dodge Dart 2016 about a week ago from a used car dealership. I did a test drive, everything was fine with the carfax, 2 previous owners. 2nd owner had it for 6 months, which I thought was odd, but people trade in cars all the time. 

Day 1 of having it for a couple of hours, after getting home the car failed to start when I tried to go to the store. I thought that was fine, I'd just notify the dealership and they'll fix it, engine light came on the second day. I went back to the dealership on Saturday for them to fix whatever was wrong with the car, and for them to finish the detail. I was there for 2 hours, and after handing me back my keys, I ask why the engine light came on, and the guy said 'something with the oil,' and that was that. 

I went on a trip with my sisters on Saturday. We just traveled an hour and 20 minutes away to go to an event. Half way through the event I decided to go buy snacks for all of us, but when I got into the car, it wouldn't start again. I tried about 2 more times until it finally started, but the car vibrated really hard and the engine light came back on. 

I made it to Target to get the snacks and when I got back to the car, and started it up, the engine began overheating, the battery light came on and the car died. So sat there for a while, a couple of people asked if I needed a jump, but I didn't accept any help, I didn't think it was the battery and I honestly didn't know what to do when an engine overheats, no car I've never had ever overheated.  I called my mom to come pick us up, since I didn't want to start the car up again, and risk damaging anything. The hood of the car was up the entire time I was sitting at target, the temperature that day was over 100 degrees. About 20 minutes later I went to see if the engine was still over heating after reading a couple or articles about overheating Dodge Dart 16s. 

It took a couple of times to get it to start, it was still overheating, but not as bad, it wasn't going above the red line. I made my way to an AutoZone that was down the street and asked for the engine light check.

I explained my situation to the guy and he told me I should bring the car back. (I already tried, salesman said no) The AutoZone guy, David, said I needed new spark plugs, which is why it isn't starting on the first try. He said that I wouldn't need new spark plugs until about 750000 miles, and I was only at 33000. 

He went ahead and checked to coolant for me after I told him about the overheating, and there was very little coolant in the car, he couldn't even see any. So I went ahead a purchased coolant, and he put it in for me. 

My mom finally made it to us, and we debated leaving the car there to be towed, but ultimately decided against it since the car was no longer overheating.

We made it about 10 minutes from home before the car died again at a red light. I pressed the gas to go, and realized the the cars engine wasn't running. A guy stopped to help us out, and checked to oil. There was no oil. He got us home, and told us to look into the lemon law. I'm in Texas. 

We notified the salesman the next day, and that's when he said that the car can't be returned, and that we have to bring the car to a Dodge dealership, since it's still under warranty. 4 days later Dodge says that the car has been in an obvious wreck and was fixed without it showing up on the carfax. They obviously did a horrible job, and the engine was damaged in the wreck, and possibly not covered under warranty, since the repairs that were done could have contributed to the engine damage. 

I just left the carsalesman and he said his boss is going to talk to the Dodge dealership, because they have to fix it under warranty. 

I do not want the car anymore, I just wanna return it. The salesman lied to me, not only about the obvious wreck damage, but about the mpg the car gets and about it having navigation. 

I'm in Texas, I wanna know my options, thanks for reading. 

Edit: I was at the dealership the day before I went on my trip, and they failed to add oil and coolant to the car. Despite telling me that the engine light was on because of a 'oil problem.'"	cars
3629	A question about tire size for my car (AKA, I goofed and am wondering if its salvageable)	"My oem wheels are 16X6.5
My normal (and officially correct) tire size is 205/55/R16

Bought some snow tires (craigslist) to swap in for winter, and somehow bought 205/65/R16 I don't know how I missed that they are 205/65, but I have them now.

My understanding of the math involved:
205 * .55 = ~112.75mm sidewall height
205 * .65 = ~133.25mm sidewall height

The difference is only 20.5mm, and here my understanding gets fuzzy. Does that mean my overall diameter got 20.5 mm greater, or 41mm greater. And either way, are those too big of increases to use?

The car in question is a 2005 VW beetle.

Aside from putting them on and trying it, is there a way to reasonably figure out if these tires will work for me?

For that matter, if I put them on, and they don't rub while turning sharply, what else can I test to make sure they are fitting ok?"	cars

3635	The Dream Of A New Rotary Sports Car From Mazda Is Still Alive		cars
3636	A new approach to Tesla/Musk/Electric Vehicle threads	"**(TL;dr: Tesla-related submissions and comments are going to be subject to increased scrutiny.)**


Stick with me here, this is going to get a bit ""Pepperidge Farm remembers"" for a minute.

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.** There are a number of bad actors on both sides of the electric vehicle argument and we've found ourselves regularly brigaded by members of both parties. 


On one hand we have anti-EV people who wish only for Tesla to fail and post articles (founded or not) that lambast Tesla and Elon Musk and anything to do with EVs, and on the other we have pro-Tesla folks (including an obstinate contingent of TSLA's own social media interns -- yes, we see you) who do all they can to spin the Tesla talk to positive.


This sort of William Randolph Hearst-esque **yellow journalism in which the headlines make the news is not acceptable here.** As one of the largest online automotive enthusiast forums operative (astonishingly, we're on track to hit 1,000,000 users by the end of the year) we have an obligation to keep our headlines fair and neutral, without giving preference to either contingent. 

Therefore, we've begun implementing some actions to minimize the effects of those acting in bad faith. **Going forward we'll be preemptively removing all EV submissions (and releasing them pending approval)** and taking a stronger stance against those who spam agenda-based posts. We will continue to monitor threads and will, as always, remove comments that are uncivil or encourage uncivil behavior (this means trolling and baiting, for instance). We will more aggressively monitor submissions for newsworthiness; one criterion will be, simply, ""Would this be newsworthy if it were about any other manufacturer?"" 

We will work to make sure that one voice does not dominate the discussion.


In short, we will not allow the Tesla War to be fought in our yard and follow us to our parlor. **This is not the place to promote your agenda;** our users have overwhelmingly indicated that, by and large, they don't want to see r/cars dominated by Tesla/EV/Musk headlines. r/teslamotors and r/realtesla exist and should be used. This isn't to say that we'll not allow any Tesla submissions: If an article passes the sniff test and is actually news, it is a valuable contribution to the subreddit and should be posted. However, we won't allow headlines to write the news and we want to make sure that we continue to have the best automotive community on the Internet.

So, as Abraham Lincoln said at the conclusion of the Civil War: [""Be excellent to each other and party on, dudes!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S67sDHdhpio)

Confession time, I'm addicted to finding deals on Craigslist, and addicted to perpetually shopping for vehicles I don't need. I also have a soft spot for odd option combos, and vehicles with perfect histories.

Anyway, I have been slowed down on my Craigslist hunting the last couple months since I picked up my Jeep. The BRZ still has low miles and a warranty, so no need to replace that...

I went to Corvettes at Carlisle last weekend, and my lifelong desire for a Corvette ramped up severely. The last couple fun cars I bought were almost Corvettes, but I wound up with something else each time. I decided I want to finally do it next year, so I started researching the market.

Looking back, the last two times I shopped for a new second vehicle (snow, cargo space, etc), I looked for 10th gen F150s with the V8, 4x4, Manual, and an extended cab. I was starting to think they didn't exist, since the rare manuals I saw were V6 2wd or V8 4x4 regular cab.

In my aimless Craigslist refreshing of all manual transmission vehicles within like 50 miles, this truck popped up. 2000 F150: V8, Manual, 4x4, Extended Cab, Off Road Package, Tow Package, 1 owner, 103k miles, black, clean, bench seat, all service history, new tires, bla bla bla, $5.5k. I emailed him immediately, test drove and brought home the next day. He had to order it custom that way and even had the window sticker. All the big service items have been taken care of recently and he even detailed it (including polishing) before I showed up.

3646	E30 gas in 99 Cadillac Eldorado	Hello everyone! I have a cadillac eldorado 99 and I was wondering if anybody has had any experience using e30 (30% ethanol) gas mix? It's a non flex fuel vehicle. If you are wondering why I want to do this, the manual states I need 91 octane gas or higher or it will run badly. It says nothing about any specific ethanol levels, just needs to be 91 octane or better. Well the manual is right. It runs SUPER BAD on 87 octane, knocks, pings, misfires, and you can seriously feel the drop in power, all the issues go away when using the 91 as stated. Well 91 is super expensive compared to 87 ($3.20 vs 2.67). E30 94 octane is only $2.52! So it seems like I have a chance to get the performance of the expensive stuff and still pay less than I would for the useless regular. I have heard of people doing this manually by mixing e85 with the standard 87 gas to make 94 e30. It so happens a new gas station opened in my area with the new mixer pumps, and it has the option to make e30 for you by the same process and comes out the same hose. I've done alot of reading and it seems there should be no reason it shouldn't work. South dakota in 2016 started the e30 challenge where they extensively tested it in many non flex fuel vehicles and found that basically any car made after 1996 the computers would be able to adjust to the e30 just fine and run nearly with the same mpg as the regular gas. In fact the higher ethanol gives higher compression and actually improves performance and the higher octane improves the knock resistance. What I want to know is if anybody beyond these big testing groups have actually TRIED THIS themselves and had success? I haven't been able to find any posts about it anywhere. The only thing I read is that higher ethanol CAN damage or corrode some of the plastic parts and stuff in non FFVs, but it seems it applies to e85 mainly, and really only if you let your vehicle sit for a long time. My cadillac is my only car and my daily driver for work, so it won't be sitting for weeks on end without being driven. I fill up about 2 times a month. I know the real answer is to just try it and test the performance and see if any problems arise. I just want to hear if any of you guys have had experience with this. Thank you all!	cars

3649	2003 Mazda Protege Stereo Upgrade Question	"I'm about to start my career and very kindly my grandmother gifted me her old car.  Besides it being 15+ years old it is in great condition (~60k miles).  My only issue with the car, if you could call it that, is the stereo.  It has the stock CD player/radio right now, and I was thinking about upgrading it to a more modern stereo that has bluetooth.

My questions are these:

1) Is this a job I could do myself?  I watched a few video online and it seems like 70% of it would just be removing the old stereo, 10% wiring a harness adapter, 20% routing wires.

2) If this is a doable job, are there many tools/parts I would need?  It seems like tools are just a few removal tools and wire strippers.  Parts are: New stereo, Install kit (like a new bracket for the stereo), Harness Adapter, Crimp Caps, and Zip ties.

3) Is it better to just pay a professional to do this and if so how much would that generally cost?

4) Is this a waste of my time, and I should just buy a radio transmitter.  Also if so, are there any that you guys suggest?  I remember back in the day having one of them for my iPod and it sucked lol.

3662	What's your personal experience switching from stick shift to automatic?	"Many people switch from driving a vehicle with a manual transmission to one with an automatic transmission, for any number of reasons, including personal interest, physical difficulty, life stage, changing priorities, or needing to share with others.

What were the reasons for you and how did it go? Was it better or worse than you anticipated? Anything unexpected, whether positive or negative?"	cars
3663	Are there any car brands or models(aside from the super luxury/sports cars) that do not go cheap on the construction/build quality/part quality?	"Let me first clarify and provide examples of what I am talking about. 

* I define *construction* as mechanical design specific to reliability. For example, I know some of the late 90s early 2000s Subaru boxers had an engine redesign that made them prone to blown head gaskets. This would be an example of cheap construction. The cut a corner to save time and money. Subaru’s are still fairly reliable but this was a clear cost cutting measure. Design quirks like odd button placement or bad infotainment design are not what I consider cheap/bad. I don’t care how impractical the creature comforts are.

 * I define * build quality* as the materials used. For example, my VW GTI has a plastic oil pan. That is cheap. Why is a metal oil pan not presents. It doesn’t have to be carbon fiber, but use plastics where appropriate. Don’t make crucial parts out of cheap material. A plastic dashboard is fine, plastic oil pan is not fine.

* I define *part quality* as the reliability and longevity of the part. For example my Golf GTI uses a plastic oil plug that is designed to fail. 

I know every automaker that makes cars under $40,000 are doing something to cut corners but who is doing the least corner cutting? Who is making a car that just works. Even Toyota and Honda are using cheap materials in places they shouldn’t these days. Just about every car brand(excluding Nissan CVTs) is reliable these days if you car for it, but there has to be some objectively that is doing something utilitarian. "	cars
3664	Car serviced and vandalized story	"Two weeks ago I took my Nissan Murano 2012 to the Nissan dealer for regular oil change. After inspection it was found that 2 brakes and rotors need replacement, and a couple of sway bar links need change, CVT fluid, injector flush etc so almost $1500 work. 

Anyhow; work is done and  when leaving the dealership I noticed ""ABS"" and "" AWD"" warning lights were on, I though they will go off soon, car was working fine so I did not worry. Lights did not go off so, 1 week after, I checked the manual which said that it is abnormal and car needs to be seen by a mechanic.

The day I was returning to the dealer I noticed another warning light went on, the"" BRAKE"" one, on arrival I explained the situation to technician  who, after inspecting the car,  showed me that both front ABS/brake sensors were cut off. He told me that warning lights were on because of that. Service advisor  told me straightforwardly this was vandalism,  these wires (they look like thin hoses next to each wheel) are not exposed. I told him lights were on when I left the dealership 2 weeks ago. Dealership denied any wrongdoing on its part, advised me to put a police report and stay safe because someone tried to mess up my car brakes.

It is almost impossible this could be done anywhere else, my car is in private secured parking spaces at home and at work and, again, the warning lights were on (except the ""BRAKE"")  when I picked up my car from the dealer 2 weeks before .

Any alternative explanation to vandalism?

#Ford Territory

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ford-territory-blue-1-800x542.jpg)

No, not the Australian vehicle based on the Falcon platform, but this SUV made in China, which is a badge-engineered Yusheng 330.

It's got a 1.5-liter/143hp 4-cylinder turbo, but a PHEV hybrid is due soon.

Expected to sell for 90,000 CNY [that's around £10,100 - with VAT it'll be around £12,100], this is a budget SUV.

I like the looks of this one, and the EcoSport is too small and there's nothing smaller than the Kuga [Ford Escape in U.S. and Canada] in the line-up currently, so this would do the job.

#Chevrolet Orlando

[Image](https://carnewschina.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chevrolet-orlando-1-800x485.jpg)

This is another case of ""recycled name, different bodystyle"". 

It's got a 1.3-litre/156hp 4-cylinder turbo, although if it came to the U.S. or Canada wouldn't it get a 1.8 or 2.0 turbo?

I like the minivan-meets-crossover-SUV looks of this one.

#Ford Everest

Since Ford seem keen to launch new SUVs, I wouldn't mind one of these truck-based ones - we only get the Ranger pick-up here, which is in itself a pretty good vehicle.

I like the idea of the 2.0-liter/210hp 4-cylinder bi-turbo turbodiesel engine [2.0 TDCi EcoBlue 210], but I doubt it'd come here to the United Kingdom.

However, I'd probably go for the 2.5-liter/164hp 4-cylinder or the up-and-coming 2.3-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost [will this have around 280hp-300hp if I'm correct]?

It's a truck-like SUV, but that's one reason I like it.

The dealer needs to do a better job on cleaning some of these cars on the lot but did a lot of the presentation have to do with bad fabric. It seems like there were some things that were solid and some areas they went cheap on. 

Also I've seen references to people complaining about the seats but most google search results were from 2015 or earlier. They felt firm and tolerable but most said it wasn't really felt except on long drives. Does this still exist in the 2018s or later?

I'm cross shopping with the Forester so this is obviously the cheap option. I liked most of the features in the base better (except for the fabric) than the supposed upgrades and once you add AWD and leather to the HRV you're in Forester territory anyway. "	cars

I was having issues with rough idling that got worse over last week to the extent my car was dying (or nearly) when I stopped. It jerked under idle power forward and back, and sometimes was hard to start. So I took it into a local mechanic that I trusted and they decided that it was the PCV valve / assembly. When I picked it up it was worse... amazingly my A/C was no longer cooling and the car jerked even more, braked weird and even got a stability control error. I took it back up and they re-scanned it. The codes said I had some BUS communication errors with the A/C and a misfire on cylinder 2.

At that point they were scratching their heads as the PCV valve shouldn't of caused any other issues. They mentioned it wasn't even close to the A/C components so they didn't even suspect the mechanic knocked something loose etc. And that point they recommended taking it into the dealer.

So I did and I just got a call that it was a bad injector and A/C sensor.

Now I am wondering if messing around with the PCV valve could knock out the A/C sensor somehow? Or is this just an amazing coincidence? I can't find anyone with opinions on this. Also... could both the injector and PCV valve of been bad? Or do you think they just shot from the hip, I assume those symptoms make sense. But I didn't know what others did in these situations when a mechanic replaces something and it's not right.

3719	[OC] Dispelling the myth that Americans uniquely dislike manual transmission – The opposite might be true!	"**TLDR at bottom**

So, you hang out long enough in car forums, and eventually you’ll see sentiment like this: “Damned [other] American drivers, hating manual transmission, if Americans didn’t hate manual so much, I can get [insert car here] in manual!” This usually shows up in discussions about how certain car models are losing the manual transmission, or in reviews of new cars when someone says something along the lines of “I’d love to buy [insert car], but it doesn’t come in manual”. 

Plenty of people seem to believe that Americans (and Canadians I guess) uniquely dislike manual transmission, that consumers outside of North America like manuals. Many different explanations are given by various different people about why this phenomenon exists, yet the idea that north American buyers uniquely hate manual has almost never been questioned. After all, 2% of new cars sold in the US today are manual.

Well I’m not denying that buyers in North American are more likely to buy automatic, but I’ve always thought the idea that only buyers in North America hate manual transmission is a myth. Today, I’m going to prove that North American buyers don’t uniquely dislike manual transmission, that the same phenomenon exists in similar forms in two other key markets (China and Germany). I will also show that there exists evidence the opposite might even be true, enthusiasts in North Americans uniquely love manual transmission.

Let’s start with China, they are the world’s biggest country, and the world’s biggest automotive market by number of cars sold. [The market share for automatics in China is around 70%](https://www.jiemian.com/article/1719103.html), way lower than in the United States, but let’s break down the numbers shall we?

I went on China’s well known automotive website Autohome (think Chinese Car and Driver) to look for cars. First thing I did, was to look at the sports car category, set the filter to manual transmissions only, and I got, [nothing. Well, ok, not exactly nothing, but you get a bunch of Morgans, and that weird X-Bow thing made by KTM, the motorcycle company.](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-7-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.html) 

Yep, that’s right, with the discontinuation of the Toyota 86 (2017 was the last model year), not a single sports car in China is sold with manual. What about the Mustang you ask? Automatic only. The Camaro? Automatic only. BMW M2? Auto only. 718? Same thing, automatic only. 

Of course, you can get base Civics, Corollas, Cavaliers (Chevy’s volume compact is the Cavalier in China), etc in manual. But let’s say, I want a car with some basic luxuries. So I went back to the search page, and looked for a manual transmission car with a few basic features that one would consider “premium” in 2018: Leather powered seats, cruise control, LED headlights, and automatic climate control. [What I got was 1 car in the whole Chinese market, some crappy FWD SUV that is never sold outside of China](https://car.autohome.com.cn/price/list-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-2_6_7_9_13-0-0-0-0-0-1.html#!). (It is also a pretty blatant Acura ripoff, it even has the beak haha). You can’t even find a car with heated seats with manual in China.

Think about it for a second. If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a manual sports car? If Chinese people like manual transmission, why can’t you get a car that is equipped with the most basic options with manual? The only way this makes sense IMO is that the majority of Chinese customers dislike manual, the only reason why manual’s market share is higher is because there are plenty of people who cannot afford the automatic option. In fact, the moment you start adding even the most basic options, you can’t get manual anymore. Why? Because overall, Chinese consumers prioritize automatic to the point where, if they can only afford a single option, it would be the automatic transmission.

Now let’s take a look at Germany, I picked them as an example because they have a strong domestic automotive industry, and that German automobiles are exported worldwide, including to North America. So I went on the German website mobile.de to look at listings (AKA, cars currently advertised for sale), and overall, 58% of new car listings are manual. Hey, that’s pretty good for manual transmissions you’d think! But let’s dig a bit further.

Let’s start with sports cars shall we? So I selected the sports cars and convertibles option, and immediately the manual transmission rate drops to 31%. Now the rate is probably actually even lower because this weird [Piaggio APE Calessino Euro 4 3 wheeled thing](https://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/details.html?id=266939234&amp;categories=Cabrio&amp;categories=SportsCar&amp;damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&amp;isSearchRequest=true&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;scopeId=C&amp;usage=NEW&amp;fnai=next&amp;searchId=74bb0a1b-ef47-f5e2-66b3-03eb5f83503e) that only comes in manual counts as a “convertible”, which I don’t think counts as a car for obvious reasons (There’s also a huge number of manual Beetle, Smart, and Fiat 500 listings, cars I don’t necessarily consider sports cars). Hmm, so overall, German sports car drivers prefer automatic over manual? This almost seems like the opposite of what we see in North America. 

Let’s dig in a little bit deeper and break it down shall we? Overall, 26.1% of Audi, 20.9% of BMW, and 8.59% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual. But remember, in Germany (unlike many export markets), these brands aren’t necessarily “luxury”, they also sell lower specced entry level vehicles (IE: The 318i with cloth interior). If we were to limit these brands to their higher priced offerings only, the manual rate again drops sharply. 

Above 50 thousand euros, only 1.01% of Audi, 1.97% of BMW, and 0.09% of Mercedes Benz listings are manual, in line with manual take rates in the United States. In fact, once you consider Porsche (a company that doesn’t sell cars cheaper than 50 thousand dollars/euros), American Porsche buyers are slightly more likely to buy manuals, 3.87% of German listings are manual, but 4.13% of American ones (on autotrader) are. 

Now if you go and search German sports car and convertible listings above 50 thousand euros, only 11% of them are manual. Interestingly enough, more than a quarter of them are Mustangs, and nearly 16% of them are Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes (Chevrolet literally has 5 dealers in all of Germany). There are currently 27 manual BMW sports cars or convertibles being advertised in Germany above the price of 50 thousand at this moment. Zero Mercedes Benz, and 3 Audis. If we use 50 thousand as the threshold for ""high end"", the German big 3 has a total of 30 high end sports cars for sale. Adding in Porsche, the big 4 German luxury brands have a total of 102 high end sports cars for sale. In comparison, if we search high end sports cars above $50 thousand USD (I know it is lower than 50 thousand euros, but european prices contain tax), 15% of them are manual on autotrader, and a good number of them are Audi's and BMWs. 

So I would conclude that German buyers are in a way similar to American and Chinese buyers in that they don’t show preference for manual transmissions, after all, German manufacturers don’t offer their flagships in manual. For instance, you can get a manual Mercedes Benz A class, but you can’t get a Mercedes Benz S class in manual. But unlike American and Chinese customers, Germans don’t consider automatic too high on their priorities list, they are willing to spend the money on certain other options before selecting automatic, but the fundamental phenomenon is still the same. Germans don’t prefer manual when they are willing to spend money, as Germans who buy expensive cars overwhelmingly choose automatic. In fact, I’m willing to take it one step further, Germans don’t like manual, they just dislike it a little less than Americans and Chinese drivers do.

I’m going to extrapolate a little bit from these two key markets and say that, to the majority of consumers worldwide, automatic is the preferred transmission. After all, good modern automatics are faster and/or get better fuel economy. The only difference is how willing consumers are to spend money on the automatic option (and how much money they have to spend in General). North American car buyers are simply more willing to spend money on the automatic (and on so many North American model cars, auto is a no-cost option). 

In fact weirdly enough, the data suggests that American enthusiasts might be the largest group of people who prefer manual out there. After all, the highest end American performance cars are all available with manual (Hellcat Challenger, Shelby Mustang, Corvette), but the same cannot be said about German (AMG GT, Audi R8, TTRS, hell, any AMG) or Japanese (Nissan GTR, Lexus LC, Lexus LFA) performance cars. Of the four German brands that make performance cars (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Porsche, and Audi), two of them (BMW, Porsche) claim that it was American demand that allowed them to sustain manual transmission development. Hell, Chinese enthusiasts don't care for manual at all! Even the Miata is automatic only in China. 

So in conclusion, the data suggests that US consumers aren’t the only ones who dislike manual transmission, consumers China, Germany, and likely other markets probably don’t like manual either. In fact, US enthusiasts are probably the ones that you should thank for the continual existence of the manual transmission performance car. 

**TLDR:** American customers aren't unique in preferring automatic over manual, they're just the ones most willing/able to pay for it. But American enthusiasts may very well be unique in their overwhelming preference for manual transmission. "	cars

3721	Need some advice	"This might be a long shot, but I want some advice because I cannot figure out what the issue might be with my car. 

I have a Renault Mégane 1.6 16v Sport 1999. Lovely car, apart from one thing... I have a high idle speed when it's cold up to about 2000 RPM, unless I release the clutch slightly in which case it'll go to about 1100RPM. Sometimes when I'm driving along it'll accelerate slightly by itself if I take my foot of the gas pedal, then suddenly slowing after about 30 seconds. Switching off the engine when at a complete stop will judder the entire car. 

Once the car has reached optimal temperature of 90°C, the problem basically disappears.

I've repositioned the throttle cable as it wasn't in the correct place, which sorted the issue temporarily. I'm possibly thinking spark plug, but there is no check engine light and it's been acting like this for a few months now. Possibly a bad throttle body?

I don't want to go to a garage and be charged X amount."	cars

Discount Tire is the same.

So, where else should I be looking?

FWIW I'm trying to find a set of 17x7.5-8 and 18x9.5-10 wheels at approx +40mm offset.  Looking to mount on 215/40R17 and 265/35R18. I like tireracks Enkei PF01, but I would have to buy a +50mm offset, which won't work."	cars
3723	"2007 Hyundai Elantra - RPMs ""bouncing"" after auto shift - is this normal behavior?"	"Video can be seen here - https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/9bmdt4/rpms_after_shift_on_elantra_is_this_normal/

A bit of background. A few weeks ago I purchased a used 07 Elantra. It very quickly presented an issue with the transmission (limp home mode with a TCC solenoid code along with trans temp sensor code). Dealer replaced the temp sensor and the issue has not reemerged.

That said, now I’m hyper sensitive to how the transmission is performing. I’ve noticed a behavior and would love to know if it’s at all abnormal.

As you’ll see in the gif, when it shifts from 3rd to 4th, the RPMs fall, but... bounce slightly?

I have no loss of power or lack of smoothness to the cars engine. Only the lack of smoothness to the falling RPMs between gears. Any reason to be concerned? Is this completely normal behavior?

Thanks in advance!"	cars
3724	Hi guys - Few issues with a Peugeot 206, need some advice.	"So, some basics:

Year: 2009

Transmission: Manual

Fuel type: Petrol

Miles: 74k


Over the past week or 10 days I’ve noticed a problem. It started with the back of the car shuddering on take off, like it was lagging behind the rest of the car. The clutch pedal has also become stiffer, it takes slightly more effort to depress it than usual. I dunno if I’m imagining it, but I think it’s also got a higher biting point than it used to. 

Then, this morning I got into reverse, and the whole car was shuddering when I was reversing at the biting point. I’m gonna book into a mechanic ASAP, but could you guys give me some advice as to what exactly could be causing it? No engine lights are on. Even though it flashes on when I turn the ignition, so the light isn’t broken. 

Could it be the clutch? I’ll check the service history but think a new clutch was fitted by the old owner at ~55k miles. I know I need a new timing belt fitted, but should I be prepared for anything else?

3739	Buy an extended warranty or trade in 2015 Buick Enclave	"My wife drives a 2015 Buick Enclave with ~62K miles, which we are still paying off ($17,000 remaining). We've had a few problems (AC leak, a faulty sensor) which of course came in right after the warranty expired, and she's just not feeling like this has lots of reliability in it. Everything so far seems to be up around the $750 to $1500 range to fix, and that'll add up very quickly **if** other stuff goes wrong.

We started talking about trading it in (looking at an Acura MDX), but financially that's a big hit. I figure the Enclave probably has enough value to cover the payoff, but that's it. So I'm not convinced that's a good route to go. The flip side is we take a few long trips in the December-February time frame (several hours each way in northeast USA) for teenage daughter's sporting commitments, and having the peace of mind that we won't break down on a busy road in wintry conditions is worth a lot.

I got a quote for an extended warranty for 4 years/80K miles that came in at $4,639. That seems high; what reputable companies should I approach for a quote? Is that price reasonable?

Summary: should we call it quits on the Enclave and trade it in (accepting it's going to be harsh financially), get an extended warranty to hedge financially, or cross fingers and hope the problems we've had so far aren't indicative of more to come?"	cars

I’ve gotten fairly decent in the past few days at shifting and whatnot, but every time I shift into third gear this painful metallic dragging sound comes from somewhere in the car (I can’t figure out if it’s coming from the front or beneath- I’m assuming it’s the front), it’s continuous and builds volume until I reach 2-25000 rpms and then it just stops completely.

The 2007 IS350 sported the longitudinal 2GR-FSE (roughly the same motor, but with direct+port injection) with 306bhp. 3,430-3,650lbs (pretty similar).

Most accounts listed the IS350 as doing 0-60 in 5.6 seconds.

The Camry V6 was listed by most accounts as doing 0-60 in 5.8-5.9 seconds.

I’m wondering why this would be. You would think the Camry would be at a major disadvantage of being FWD (with terrible weight distro), having an open diff, and having skinny 215 tires.

The IS350 is slightly handicapped from the get-go by having an open diff and only 225-width tires, but wouldn’t the RWD be enough to at least give it a 0.3+ second head start in straight-line acceleration?

Obviously handling will be day and night- that is no question. But it seems the IS was a severe underperformer given the power output and other cars in its class. Maybe the 4.09 diff ratio was ill-suited to the transmission?"	cars
3759	Its not always cheaper to buy then rent...[RANT]	"Just like Yoplait, sweet tldr on the bottom, life story on top.

So, a little background. My wife and I are from the Balkans, and since we had kids, we've been coming to Croatia every summer for at least 5 weeks to hang out with family and to expose the kids to our native culture. We also travel a lot when we come, so in the past we had been renting cars. This usually ends up costing about 2000 euros per month because we always need a van or wagon and we travel internationally, etc. 

This year I managed convince my work to let me work remotely, so we decided to come for 3 months instead. Well, I didn't feel like dropping 6000 euros for a rental car so we decided we should just buy our own, and leave it with my mother in law, so we would have a car that  would be cheaper than renting over time, and worst case scenario, could re-sell and be out of pocket a much smaller amount. We decided to get a wagon, van or suv and budgeted 8000 euros as our limit.

Well, I know a bit about cars, so I did a bunch of craigslist (njuskalo) shopping around before we came and had lined up a bunch of cars to go take a look at. I even brought my OBD2 reader as backup. Well after spending a week going to see a bunch of used and abused jalopies, we finally found a really nice 2013 Peugeot 508SW 2.0HDI. It was high milage (140,000) but the guy who owned it was a traveling salesman and took really good care of it. It only had 3 issues I wasn't stoked on.

1. Its a 6 speed semi auto...really wanted a manual in Europe of all places
2. It needed a new coolant hose, the old one just looked a little worn
3. The guy had his elbow in the same place for 5 years and had actually created a dent in the interior door panel.

Apart from that the car was great. I did a full under and over inspection on it, it drove great, shifted great, no faults, no creaks nothing. The guy was asking $9000 for it, but I managed to talk him down to eight.

Immediately I took it to the dealer and had them change out all the fluids, filters and the messed up hose and update all the software to the latest version. I also had them change out the timing belt and water pump as those are the first to go. This service cost me another 1000euros, but I figured if we're gonna hang onto this car for a few years, its gonna be worth making sure its in great shape.

And it was. We drove it up and down the coast, went to Italy with it and a bunch of city driving, and the kids got a kick out of going through all the tunnels with the panoramic roof. Then one day as we were headed to Italy for the second time, we got stuck in the border crossing line and as we're stop and going, the transmission starts to jerk...A LOT. It feels like it drops out of gear, then just slams it into 1st when I let off the brake. I put it into manual mode and its fine, but I was getting sketched out. I park it in Trieste for a few hours, and on the trip back, it shifts fine. Then a few days later we're headed to one of the islands and I notice that every time it shifts from 5th to 4th its rough.

My first though is that its oil, but I did a bunch of research and apparently these gearboxes are supposed have lifetime oil, but a bunch of people have issues with the valve bodies going to shit (Aisin AW6 if you're interested). So I take it back to the authorized service center and they wont touch automatics and they send me to a little mom and pop shop that apparently specializes in autos. I call them, but they're booked for a week and we were going to Dalmatia the following week so no one would be able to touch it for 2 weeks. We drive down (about 250 miles) the next week and its definitely shifting rough, but since its mostly freeway, it never really leaves 6th gear. 

So finally we get back last week and the very next day I take it to the shop and the guy tells me its probably just the oil. They go to change it and its tar black. They end up changing it twice, just because it was in such a bad condition, a single change it was still bleeding black. Apparently they recommend changing that oil every 60000km and call the ""lifetime"" label bullshit. He also tells me to drive it around for a while and if its still rough, we'll probably going to have to change the valve body (1000 euro for the part + labor).

Next few days Im driving it around and its night and day. The car is more responsive, smooth, dare I say feels faster. No issues in traffic, no rough shifts. I think AWESOME, a $100 gear oil change just saved my ass. So yesterday I had a doctors appointment in Ljubljana, about 2 hours away and in a different country. The family and I decide to make it a day trip and as we're driving out there the car is doing great. No issues at speed, smooth shifts, the border crossing handled like a champ! That is until the second we got off the highway in Ljubljana. As I'm pulling up to the light, the gearbox clunks, and ""Gearbox Fault, get immediate service"" message comes on the dash. The car locks me in 3rd gear but luckly its a diesel, so it has the needed torque to get it going...but I top out at about 40mph. So I limp it to the doctors office, get my exam and while waiting find a Peugeot dealer...only dealer in the fucking country, a few miles away. So we jump in the car again, and the fault is gone, but its shifting rough again. I get it to the dealer after a day to diagnose it, I get the bad news...I need a new valve body...to the tune of 2100 euros. 

I looked up used trannies for this car, called around, and in Croatia I would have ended up having to pay around $1500 euros, but with towing fees, it would come out about the same. So my whole plan of buy a car for 8000 euros because it will pay off in a year or two, is now a car of 12000  euros...and its still a fucking automatic...sigh.

TLDR: Visiting Croatia for 3 months, decided it would be cheaper to buy a car then rent one. Bought a used car from a private party, inspected it, scanned it, drove it. Everything was great, then the automatic gearbox starts acting up. Changed the oil and boom, back to perfect again, then yesterday, I drove 2 hours to a different country only for it to throw up a ""gearbox fault"" and I'm out 2100 euros for a new valve body.

3777	What do you guy's think of Chrysler Corporation after the Lee Iacoca years?	"If there's one thing I've learned about Chrysler Corp in my years of being an automotive enthusiast, it's always that they were always a roller-coaster of successes and failures. They were always the underdog in third place fighting for the domestic market with Ford and General Motors.

The 70s almost saw them die, and the 80s saw their amazing resurgence. It seems however, their story kind of gets forgotten about towards the mid to late 90s, up to the present day. 

I mean that in both terms of models sold, and company reputation. Nobody ever talks about Chrysler besides their performance oriented line of vehicles. In an ironic way, AMC's formidable Jeep subdivision seems to have been (and still be?) Chrysler's most valuable asset. 

I'm not sure what got me on this train of thought. I think it's because I got interested in the Dodge Intrepid SXT models, and realized the total lack of interest for any of Chrysler's more casual or low tier sport vehicles. Was their reliability that horrible? Was it just Chrysler suffering from smaller market share? 

In my day to day life, I still see tons of late 90s and early 00s GM or even Ford vehicles. Chrysler Corp passenger vehicles just seem to be all but gone. I still see a load of trucks and jeeps though. 

As a casual observer, does anyone have any fond memories of Chrysler's vehicles in the late 90s? Were they any good? 
What do you think of their brand focus today? 

I kind of can't believe Chrysler ditched the affordable compact market in favor of ""muscle"" cars, cuvs/suvs, and trucks. I mean, the dart was all but unadvertised. It's barley even getting any performance oriented attention either. I've also heard general reliability is a lot to be desired as well. 

It seems like the company hasn't known what the hell they're doing since the 08 recession. Possibly even prior to that. Regardless of sales, they still seem to be suffering in reliability. 

Edit: Some words because people are anal.

3778	Suspected Head Gasket Leak?	2005 Honda Cr-v 111k miles. Just bought this car. Cylinder 4 was misfiring so I replaced the spark plugs and that seemingly solved the problem.. until now. My car has had rough idle but it would usually go away if I turned off the AC, so I didn’t think much of it. Today my engine light came back on for a Cylinder 4 misfire again. Now, when I replaced the spark plugs, I also had someone check the coils and he said there was no problem with the coils. So, I don’t feel like I need to replace the coil. Recently, I took my car to the mechanic for an unrelated issue and when I had my boyfriend follow me back he noticed a thin white smoke coming out of my exhaust. This was also in the morning so I figure it could be condensation. Another problem I have is coolant loss. So, i’m afraid I may have a head gasket leak. I’m running a compression test tomorrow.

3788	Worth dealing with rust?	"We own a 2006 Honda Pilot.  Have had for several years, under 120k miles.

 This vehicle has been 90% garage kept, generally left out in the summer as our garage becomes filled with bikes/scooters, etc.  

This gen of Pilot has some very common rust issues. I see it pretty much every time I see this model around here (Ohio).

Local body shop that has a rep for being quality and low priced quoted $700 to fix these spots and would need to keep the car for 3 days.  They said they would be cutting out metal, replacing, painting.  The car is probably only worth $5-6k, so I have trouble with the idea of dropping that much on an older vehicle for what seems like a cosmetic problem.

https://m.imgur.com/a/TBRoT2h

Is it really just a cosmetic problem only, or is this going to lead to bigger problems?  We just bought a newer van so this is pretty much just a vehicle for me to drive back and forth to work, the family trips will be in the van.  I intend to drive this for at least 3-5 more years unless some big repair or something else gets in the way. 

I've also searched around on YT for videos, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4vusY2-rkQ 

I know this might not be the way to properly fix this, but if I can get it looking cosmetically better for under $100 I'm not opposed to that.  I realize the correct way is probably taking it to the pros at the shop, I just can' decide if it's worth that.

3789	Is it safe to put Rock Wool insulation in a car? (Miata specifically)	"As most know, the OG miata's are plagued by copious amounts of road noise - mostly caused by the tunnels that lead from the trunk to cabin. There are small openings here and there where it can breath into the cabin. The cavity pretty much amplifies road noise. A lot of people have had success quieting their cars by filling the cavities- which is what i wan to do. 

I was thinking of using acoustic roxul rock wool -however the only thing that worries me is having so much rock wool concentrated in a tiny miata cabin.  This might sound a bit stupid - but I've never use such insulation  and I'm not sure if its safe - i.e bumps causing fibers to float around and being breathed in by me and a passenger.

Alternate option is fulling bags with the stuff and forcing it in the cavity. 

**Question: Is it safe to just ram it in, or should i take more precautions and fill bags and stuff the bags in the car. As a side note material is water and fireproof.**

3799	A Month With Giulia	"Hey all, I picked up an Alfa Romeo Giulia just a little over a month ago and figured I’d pass on my first impressions about the car.


**Background**: I leased the car on July 23rd. It’s a 2018 Ti Lusso Q4. I went with the Lusso over the Ti Sport because the seats in the sport felt very uncomfortable due to their really aggressive bolstering and I’m a pretty large guy (6’2” 240lbs).


**Price**: The car’s MSRP was around 53k, but after everything I had over 10k in discounts/rebates. I leased it at 2 years, 12k/year, and put absolutely nothing down. My payment is $500/month. I had done most of my research on Edmunds and LeaseHackr and had an idea of what I wanted to pay; I basically brought my research and calculations in with me and showed them I felt I should be able to get it for and ended up paying within a few dollars of my goal.


**Exterior**: I think the car looks great and rather sporty. I went with the Vesuvio Gray Metallic paint and it hides dirt well. It’s a bit lower than my last car, a 2015 Hyundai Genesis, but not by much and I’m pretty used to lower cars. I live in one of the snowiest cities in America, so we’ll see how it goes through the winter, but with snow tires and AWD it should be simple considering I drove a 2002 Dodge Neon with bald tires for a few years in college in the same weather.


**Interior**: I went with the one with red leather. I love it. The overall interior is high quality with a lot of soft touch surfaces in all the right places. It was a bit small at first coming from the Genesis, but I have no problems with it now. I don’t think anyone much taller than I could fit into the seat without their head touching the ceiling. The trunk and trunk opening are relatively small, but I can fit most things I need to in there and the seats fold down (thank god, they didn’t in the Genesis). The back seat is somewhat tight with taller people sitting up front but would be fine for shorter trips. My back seat is occupied by 2 dogs 99% of the time so it isn’t a problem.


**Technology**: The controls in general are pretty intuitive. There are some exceptions. The turn signal stock doesn’t click and stay in the spot you push it in to, it basically just goes up/down and then back to center. A hard push keeps the signal on until you complete a turn and a lighter one just blinks a few times for lane changes. It took a bit to get used to at first, but I’m used to it now.


The engine auto start/stop is interesting, but annoying when it’s hot out. It shuts the AC off for the most part and it can get hot inside quick. It does, however, fire up fast and I haven’t had any issues with it. I turn it off when it’s hot out.


My one gripe is the lack of touch screen, but I’ve also gotten used to that. Though I would still like one. It does have CarPlay and Android Auto but using them without a touch screen is somewhat annoying. The click wheel in the center works fine for navigating for the most part and the rest of the controls are all on the wheel or easily accessible. The entertainment system does boot up the instant I turn the car on, which is great since the Genesis would take a few seconds (or longer sometimes).


All the other fancy driving aids seems to work well. The adaptive cruise I’ve used several times and works fine, the lane departure warning works, but it doesn’t automatically steer you back into the lane so I’ve just turned it off since it can get annoying (it makes a sound that sounds like rumble strips whereas the Genesis just had the wheel vibrate and steered you back into the lane which was great).


**Performance**: Coming from the boat that is the Genesis (currently the G80) this thing is quick and handles amazingly well. The steering is very tight. I opted for the adjustable dampers and it’s noticeable going between the two levels. 


In normal driving mode the car is pretty standard, quiet, and handles the road well. In Dynamic (aka Sport) mode it is significantly tighter, rougher, and you can feel every part of the road (which is awesome). Sport also seems to tighten up the steering and the way it manages the gears is very aggressive compared to other cars with a sport mode that I’ve driven. The way it manages the gears and feels in general is reminiscent of a Ferrari 488 I recently drove on vacation in Italy (which I guess makes sense). There is definitely a huge difference between normal and Dynamic modes; far more than any car I’ve driven in the past.


In both modes the paddles are amazing. They feel great and respond extremely quick.


There is also a mode called Advanced Efficiency which I cannot review as I have only ever driven in it during the test drive, though I think the way it gimps the throttle response will be helpful in the winter.


I think the epa mpg is something like 23/31. In my first 1500 miles or so I’ve sat around 20mpg city and the one long road trip I took was over 38mpg highway (cruising at ~80 the whole way, which is even more impressive). I could definitely improve the city mileage, but na.


Feel free to ask any questions!

Edit: I forgot to mention, I was super annoyed because apparently WeatherTech doesn't make front mats for this car, so I ended up going with these ones called Tux Mats. They are really nice and match the quality of the interior really well.

Here are a couple pics of the car and of the floor mats/seat: https://imgur.com/a/bKHzugB

I've been eager to learn how tire pressure affects the heat-up of the tires.

My logic says the less PSI you have, the more the tire will deform thus will heat up quicker, also due to a bigger contact patch.

However, my friend says it's the opposite and that reducing tire pressures allow the tire to cool down as it isn't pressed down as hard.

Is there a definitive answer?

"This morning on my way into work, I saw a [1st gen Mazda 5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Mazda5_front_20100923.jpg/1200px-Mazda5_front_20100923.jpg) driving around and noticed the floating roof design. The floating roof has been getting a bad rap since it's came out [(CHR for example)](https://hips.hearstapps.com/amv-prod-cad-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/17q3/685270/2018-toyota-c-hr-test-review-car-and-driver-photo-688558-s-original.jpg), so it got me thinking on who started it. Was Mazda/Ford the first, or was it done before 2004?   

EDIT: The trend of painting the rear pillar and glass black to give the roof the illusion it's ""floating"""	cars
3828	On-the-go Auto repairs in Mad Max: Fury Road, Is This Possible?	"Evening r/cars.
I've been watching Mad Max: Fury Road like, once a year now, because I love the movie. However something cool (but also maybe unrealistic, maybe) I've always noticed is that at least twice in the film the War Rig (an 18-wheeler tanker) is tuned up or repaired *while the Rig is still in motion and active.* Here's a fuzzy clip from youtube of Furiosa going under the cab to do repairs while the rig is still in motion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeWaNT3byVU

I guess my question is, in an 18-wheeler like we have in the movie, or any vehicle in general, is it actually possible to fix any part of the engine or coolant system while the vehicle is in use. About three times in Max Max: Fury Road does the engine(s) go out or become inoperative, and all of them *appear* to stem from overheating, so I'm going to assume all of the 'repairable' parts have to do with the coolant system, but I could be wrong. Also the rig appears to have more than one engine-- is this even possible?

Also this is probably not in the vein of this reddit, so I apologize if it's a bit of an off-shoot. I can't find clips of the main characters fixing the engine while it moves. But in either case, thanks and I look forwards to hearing your dude's ideas.

3830	Making sure a car is good for high-intensity use. 2011 mini cooper s.	"Hi. I recently(read: about 1 year ago) really got into cars. I never really paid too much attention to my own as they were hand-me-downs, but I've recently realized one of my cars is moderately decent and needs some serious love(2011 Mini cooper S. 2.0 liter turbo).

I'd like to be confident in this car to the point where I wouldn't be hesitant to take this car to a track/drag strip day or two. Granted, yeah, mini, but it does have a 0-60 of about 6 and a quarter mile in the 15-s. Either way, beggers can't really be choosers and I am not the richest man.

all that being said, it has about 60k miles. I've done regular service on time. Oil, coolant, tires, everything. It's probably never been taken above 5k rpms in it's entire life. Most if it's life has been driving 75mph in 6th gear with minimal clutch usage.

Is there anything special I should do or check before actually using the car to more of it's potential? There are no error codes, and there has never been an engine problem with this entire car.

So far, I'm planning on installing a boost gauge to see what the turbo is doing, in addition to installing a temperature gauge. I'm also planning on changing the oil and getting a coolant flush. Anything major I'm missing here?

thanks."	cars
3831	Guides to EFI tuning?	"This may be the wrong sub, but here goes...

Does anyone know any good course material for EFI tuning? I already understand the basics behind EFI so I’m not looking for an explanation. I need to know more about what the values in the table represent and how to find more appropriate values. 

I realize there are hundreds of tables and it’s impossible to explain them all. To be more specific, I need info on how to dial in AFR by adjusting the O2 sensor scale, maf voltage, and engine load. I also want to maximize torque and horsepower by optimizing throttle tables, etc... I’m not looking for info on boosted applications either. I’m only NA right now. Maybe in the future I hope!

I don’t have a dyno at my disposal, so I’ll be street tuning instead. I have data logging, and table editing abilities. I know it’s not ideal, but I’m working with what I have. I’d rather learn something along the way then pay someone a ton of money for a result that I have to trust based on faith in their abilities. "	cars

3834	A question about fancy vs. budget tyres	"Hello people who know things about cars, I know little and come seeking your knowledge.

I need to buy four new tyres for my car. I use it normal use - commuting and occasional long distances (for the UK anyway), no racing or shenanigans like that. Currently I've got Continental tyres which came with the car. I'm led to believe they're relatively expensive as tyres go. They're double the price of some of the ones I'm seeing to replace them with.

My question is this: if I were to buy these ""budget"" tyres, would I notice any real difference in typical use? Would it feel any different? Would it last half the time of the comparatively expensive tyre? Is there any point in me paying more if I'm driving to work not a racetrack?

It seems like all the newer suv models have different safety cameras and/or sensors coming as standard.

It would be a great differentiated selling point, maybe even lower insurance costs! 3rd party options are clunky.	cars

But the big question is, how do I tell if they are in fact real or fake? Google tells me the BBS trademark stamp on the rim is an indicator that they are legit. But how true is that? Is here an expert who can tell? If needed, I can provide more pictures of any part of the rim.

3856	Sedan Tire Load Rating and Model Conideration	"Hi there,

I searched Load Rating here in the sub and read through a couple responses, but a little paranoid so figured I'd ask since I'm in a spot.  Thanks for the help.

​

2016 Honda Civic EX-T, OEM tire is a 215/50R17 91H

Currently limping around on my spare tire (left rear) after getting a nail that can't be repaired.  Donut tire.  Short 8 mile commute and minimal other driving.

My tire place has a 95V Michelin Premier A/S tire set in stock, but I could potentially order a 91H but would have to wait a week or two for delivery before I could install.

Is there a big issue and/or will it be negatively noticeable both from a ride quality or fuel issue to have a 95V vs the 91H?

​

Also... the tire I think really prefer (Michelin Primacy MXM4) is on back order.  Looking at the Premier, it's not as highly rated.  Tire guy said only complaint about Premier was they don't seem to get to their mileage warranty, but I don't drive all that much, so I figure tire will dry rot before I get that high in the miles.  Any thoughts on that?

​

Thanks much, and any other input appreciated.  FWIW - Trying to stick with Costco after previous bad experiences with Discount Tire.  Local place an option if necessary, though seems will be pricier.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Does a 95V tire vs an OEM 91H tire make any difference whatsoever for normal commuting type stuff?  And would it be worth waiting a week or two driving on a spare to get the 91H if so?"	cars

3860	Car Rant.	"I'm 21 years old and my family has an extra car laying around (my mothers old car that was meant for me and my brother when she got a new car) that I have been driving to and from Community College. It's a 2011 Toyota Corolla. It f\*cking sucks. It's the most bland boring vanilla car there is. It doesn't turn heads and does NOT get me p\*ssy like if I had a sports car. It's great on gas mileage though.

I'm a senior in college and I work part time while going to school and my mother insists that I just keep driving the Corolla while saving my money for a newer better car. My brother lives at school so while he's at school I get to drive the Corolla to and from my community college. (My mother said it's the equivalent towards his dorm...actually cheaper). So she doesn't mind me using it. I have $6k in the bank and it's growing. My dad tells me that he's impressed with how much money I have saved because when he was in college most of it went to stupid stuff and he never had around that much money. (Also because he lived on campus so he was limited to where and how much he could work). But $6k IS NOT ALOT OF MONEY. However I have to pay for my phone, gas, books, miscellaneous college stuff. I've been told by both my parents that If I continue to save by the end of the school year I will be on track with around $9-10k in my bank account. Enough (from them) to buy me a better newer safer ""cooler"" car.

As it sits now, at $6k I really couldn't even buy a new sports car??? Chances are my budget will limit me to an older Civic/Accord/Camry/Corolla so my parents said just drive the newer one that I am driving now. BUT IT PISSES ME THE FRICK OFF whenever I roll up to campus lot and see kids with new-ish WRX's, BRZ/FRS and Mustangs. How? HOW DID THEY AFFORD THAT?! I'm so salty and jealous of them. I work my ass off but I have to pay for phone, rent, books, gas, clothes, deodorant (that random shit). I am luckily provided free food because I do the dishes and earn my keep around the house.

HOWEVER I DRIVE A FRICKEN TOYOTA COROLLA! How am I suppose to impress the chicks like the kids with the WRXs, and Mustangs!?!?! HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO HAVE A COOL FUN CAR.

I've been daily driving a '95 Miata with 175,000 miles for over a year and while I enjoyed the car at first, it's been having a ton of ""old car problems"" that's making me hate driving my car. The A/C doesn't work half the time and when it does blow cold, it screws with the idle of the car making it almost undrivable in traffic. The engine makes weird noises every once in a while. The old suspension has started creaking and groaning as I drive over every bump. I've replaced all of the coolant hoses, water pump, timing belt, valve cover gasket, and the old radiator cap and it's still leaking coolant and oil from somewhere. It's got cheap looking aftermarket wheels and literally the cheapest Walmart tires you can buy. The brand new cheapo soft top I spent an entire weekend installing just 8 months ago is already falling apart. The speakers sound like shit too so I can't even listen to my music in traffic without hearing static. I could go on and on and yet it still starts up every single morning and still looks decent for it's age.

Yeah it's a fun car and I still enjoy rowing through the gears and wringing out all that 125 hp when I get the chance. Yet, as a daily, it's been driving me crazy every day. I can't afford to do anything to it other than basic maintenance and I don't even have a garage anymore to work on it myself. I'd sell it but I honestly don't know what else I could replace it that would still be affordable, well-maintained by previous owners, and at least somewhat fun to drive.
