2	After Boogie went down, Anthony Davis averaged 30 points, 12 rebounds, 2 assists with 2 steals and 3 blocks (on 59TS%) to lead the Pelicans to 21/33 wins, a 52-win pace.	"[BBRef link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02/gamelog/2018#378-410-sum:pgl_basic)

AD averaged 30.2/11.9/2.2/2/3.2 on 51/34/84 shooting (59TS%), scoring over 30 points 15 times, over 35 points 9 times, over 40 points 6 times, and over 50 points once. 

During a particularly memorable 2 week stretch (10/2-26/2), **Davis averaged a ridiculous 42/15/2/3/3.2 on 63TS%**, with the Pels going 6-0 during this period (part of a longer 10-game win-streak).


- - - 

Interestingly, the Pelicans played at a 46-win pace before the Boogie injury and a 51-win-pace after. It should be noted however that they had been on a 4-game winning streak right before the injury happened (winning 8 of the past 11 games too) so who knows how many wins they would’ve gotten had Boogie stayed healthy and kept their positive momentum going (Pels lost 5 of the first 6 games after Cousin’s injury, with the team struggling to find the right balance with one of their Twin Towers abruptly gone)."	nba

27	[OC] I created that All-Star Multiplier for Zach Lowe	"There’s a been a bit of chatter surrounding Zach Lowe’s comment about an “All-Star multiplier”, so I decided to go ahead and just make one. I’ll start off with a really basic summary of what I did, a summary of the results, and then I’ll go into more detail at the end for anyone who’s interested.

Disclaimer: This doesn’t matter for perennial All-NBA players like Duncan, LeBron or KD. We know they’re good. This is for the players like Webber and Bosh that Lowe was talking about, where sometimes they did or didn’t get in because of the strength of the players in their conference.

This also isn’t meant to be an exact statistic. It’s a rough measure of the ‘eye-test’ discrepancies between a player’s quality and their number of All-Star appearances.

[Link to all charts and tables if you don’t want to open them individually](https://imgur.com/a/4D685aa)

&amp;#x200B;

In all charts, red is West team and blue is East team

&amp;#x200B;

**Basic summary:**

* I took all the All-Star Teams from 1980 onwards, corresponding to 250 unique players in all
* How ‘difficult’ it was to make a team (e.g. the 2005 Eastern Conference All-Star Team) was defined using the worst player to make that team, as measured by VORP. This is the VORP Threshold for that year.

[VORP Threshold, along with corresponding player, for each year and conference](https://imgur.com/a/U1MYZ3B)

&amp;#x200B;

[All-Star team VORP thresholds ordered from highest to lowest (bar chart)](https://imgur.com/a/qJzxWXw)

&amp;#x200B;

* All Star teams were then scaled based on the average and standard deviations of these VORP Thresholds, allowing us to rank how much each All-Star Team is ‘worth’ (see detailed explanation at end for more info on this step). These ranged from about 0.4 of an All-Star to about 1.5 All-Stars. These are the Adjusted All-Stars (AAS)

&amp;#x200B;

[All-Star teams ordered by Adjusted All-Star from highest to lowest](https://imgur.com/a/ipuN0sP)

&amp;#x200B;

* I then added up how many Adjusted All-Stars each player had, and looked at how that compared to their actual All-Stars

&amp;#x200B;

**Results Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

Only a few players (plus a handful of perennial All-NBA players that I’ll ignore, since they’re not the focus here) had **an absolute difference greater than one between their Adjusted All-Stars and their actual All-Stars**. This is good, because we don’t want to be making huge changes, we just want to tweak a few that seem a bit off.

|Player|Adjusted All-Stars|Actual All-Star|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Alex English|6.48|8|\-1.52|
|Amar'e Stoudemire|7.25|6|\+1.25|
|Brad Daugherty|6.0|5|\_1.0|
|Chris Webber|5|6.55|\+1.55|
|James Worthy|5.44|7|\-1.56|
|Kevin Duckworth|0.84|2|\-1.16|
|Peja Stojakovic|4.35|3|\+1.35|
|Shawn Marion|5.13|4|\+1.13|
|Steve Nash|9.5|8|\+1.5|
|Tom Chambers|2.93|4|\-1.07|
|Yao Ming|9.11|7|\+2.11|

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This correlates really well with what Lowe was talking about. Chris Webber with somewhere between 6 and 7 All-Stars seems more right than the 5 he actually has. Amar’e, Marion, Yao and Peja also get bumps, which lines up with the calibre of player they were. Tom Chambers loses an All-Star, which strengthens the case for why he’s not in the Hall despite 20k points. James Worthy loses 1.5, which matches up with him maybe being slightly overrated as an individual talent due to being on the Showtime Lakers. Apart from these players, the amount of All-Stars the other players have stays relatively static – again, this is good.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other interesting takeaways:**

* The strongest teams were the ’96, ‘00 and ’02 West teams, worth 1.496 AAS, and the weakest team was the ’89 West team, worth 0.364 AAS. The 2010 West team was the only other team worth less than 0.5 AAS, at 0.449
* The Eastern All-Star teams recently haven’t been great, but they’re nowhere near historically bad – apart from last year, they’ve been above 0.9 AAS for years.
* Because of this, Chris Bosh sticks around his 11 All-Stars. He’s hurt a bit by the weaker teams in the 2010’s, but he also made stronger Eastern teams in years like ’08 and ’10. Chris Bosh really is an 11-time All-Star (by this metric at least)
* Western All-Star teams through the 80s were actually easier to get onto than Eastern teams have been recently. Players that racked up appearances on those teams should be just as scrutinised as players like Bosh (e.g. Tom Chambers, James Worthy).
* The West teams in the early 00’s were, as you would expect, insane
* As pointed out by u/ygduf, Klay Thompson's AAS is, incredibly, 4.20

&amp;#x200B;

**Detailed explanation/justification of what I did:**

The main point of the All-Stars multiplier is to account for the fact that sometimes it’s easier to get into the All-Star Game in a weaker conference. My measure of how ‘difficult’ it was to make an All-Star Team was to look at the worst player that got onto the team (as measured by VORP). So, if Chris Kaman made the West team in 2010, that’s not that impressive of a team to make. On the other hand, if no-one worse than Melo made the West team a year later, that’s more impressive for your resume.

I also removed the players who were voted in by fans despite not deserving an All-Star (e.g. Kobe and AI in their last couple of seasons). If bad players get in via fan voting, it doesn’t mean it was easy to make the team that year (in fact, it’s probably harder, since there’s one less spot for those who deserve to make the team).

I then scaled each of the years based on the average and standard deviations of the VORP threshold. The average VORP threshold was about 1.14. That’s roughly equivalent to Roy Hibbert in 2013/14, or John Wall/Goran Dragic in 2017/18 – basically, that’s about how good the worst All-Star is on an average All-Star team. The standard deviation was 0.88, or the difference between Giannis and KD last year (KD played fewer games, which VORP takes into account).

I used a standard deviation for scaling that was 4 times the size of the actual standard deviation of the VORP thresholds. This was chosen via trial and error, where I looked at the results using different standard deviations for scaling. I wanted a scale where the worst year was still worth about 0.5 AAS and the best wasn’t worth more than 1.5 AAS. This was probably the most subjective part, but I don’t think those are unreasonable thresholds.

I’ll explain that whole ‘scaling’ thing in slightly simpler terms. If the worst player to make an All-Star Team in a season has a VORP around 1.1 or 1.2, then making an All-Star team that year was still worth about 1 AAS. If the worst player to make the team was better than that, it was worth more than 1 AAS, and if the worst player was worse than that, it was worth less than 1 AAS. If the worst player on Team 1 had a VORP 0.88 higher than the worst player on Team 2, Team 1 is worth 0.25 AAS more than Team 2 (1 standard deviation = 4 \* 0.88, so 0.88 = 1/4 standard deviations)."	nba

43	5 Reasons why the Eastern Conference is better than the Western Conference	"Reason 1: All the Eastern teams are actually in the Eastern half of the US/Canada. The Thunder, Rockets, Mavericks, Grizz, Pels, Timberwolves and maybe Spurs are all East if the geographic center of the the US. Shame.

Reason 2: The East has a max of 2 teams in a single state, in NY and Florida so, the teams see more States than the West with 3 Texas and a 4 California teams.

Reason 3: The East is international. They have a Canadian team. They’re much more worldly and cultured than the isolationists in the West

Reason 4: By not having as many All-NBA talents, they are able to grow new stars faster and don’t have as many teams trying to pay luxury tax for a 1st round exit because of

Reason 5: The East is more competitive top to bottom. Sure like 3 or 4 to 11 in the West is tough sure, but literally every team in the East has a chance at the playoffs after LeBron LeLeft, except Brooklyn, Atlanta, Orlando and maybe Washington if Dwight kills them- thus they will be jockeying for position all year. Last year 1 to 3 in the West was a 16 game difference. 1 to 8 in the East was the the same. So it’s clear which one is more exciting and fascinating to follow and watch.

Thus, Seattle fans should redirect all of their frustration at the planet. The true cause of the Super Sonics being moved to Oklahoma."	nba

53	Who will have a better 2018-19 season, Lakers or Spurs?	The Lakers gained a superstar while the Spurs lost a superstar. I would favor the Spurs given their history of success in their system. I would expect DeRozan to integrate well. The Lakers have a host of new players to integrate and I'm not sure how they will structure their offense, but I assume it will be led by Rondo/Ball in a motion type offense.	nba

58	What if the NBA became affiliated with colleges?	"NBA Teams can have X amount of school's basketball programs on their payroll and they become affiliated with the NBA team. Not all players are are students but signed by the NBA team/college affiliate. Some players on the team are students and continue the existing structure. 

This way the NBA does not worry about developing markets since college games are packed. Players all live on campus, non-student players have to do student body stuff to be part of the school spirit. 

It is not perfect but at least players who would never have gone to school get paid, and the entire system is not changed radically. 

The draft would be for unsigned student players. It would be less exciting but still decent since college age has such variance in potential growth.

60	Change the outcome of a shot. How does it change NBA history?	Ray Allen misses the infamous BANG 3 pointer that sends the game to OT.  Tom Duncan gets his 6th ring, TP gets FMVP.

62	The worst argument I consistently see on this subreddit	"""Player B is better/more valuable than player A because they're both better off as second/third options on a championship team (since A isn't quite good enough to be ) and B is better at that."" 


What the hell? When did players start getting compared in the context of ""if you put clearly better players on the team he'll complement him better"". The idea of direct player comparison  is ""WHO IS BETTER AT PLAYING PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL?"" . I can understand if player B makes his teammates better due to playmaking/gravity/decision making etc. But that would just be an attribute that makes him a better player and therefore more suited to be the man on a team. It's moronic logic like this that makes people think klay is better than Jimmy Butler. 


People act like every team can be a championship contender. There's a few real contenders in the nba in an average year, most teams are not championship teams. How is not being good enough to be the #1 on a championship quality team an indictment of a player if he's still better at that than the player he's being compared to? He's still taking you further. 

There is a difference between ability and fit. It seems people here think having more limitations as a player in the interest of portability is better than being more talented/complete if you have to be a featured player."	nba

70	Something to think about		nba
71	In this very moment, DeMar DeRozan gives up his soul to the Spurs soul box - 2018 ECSF G1		nba
72	What happens if you bounce a ball into the hoop?	Say you’re trying to make a bounce pass and you bounce it too hard and it ends up going into the hoop, would that count? Would it be a 2 or a 3?	nba
73	If Lebron buys a team and Bronnie makes the NBA, can/should Bronnie sign with Bron’s team as a FA for the minimum?	"First, for the purposes of this question, I’m assuming Bron buys a team and Jr. makes the NBA.  A quick look at how realistic that is:

* Lebron’s [estimated net worth]( http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/lebron-james-net-worth-2018-contract-salary-cavs-news-nike-sponsors-charity-twitter-instagram/se3jt30lfipn1s5lnjazt98ae) today is $440M.  It’s pretty much accepted at this point he has a $1B lifetime deal with Nike (although there appears to be no firm proof).  The [least-expensive valuation]( https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/02/07/nba-team-values-2018-every-club-now-worth-at-least-1-billion/#21a5921f7155) in the league is NOP at a cool $1B.  Assuming Lebron continues to grow his brand and invest wisely (reasonable assumptions), it’s very possible that majority ownership of an NBA franchise will be within his reach.

* Bronnie is only an 8th grader.  The NBA is a long way off and lots of players who were great in middle school never make the league.  There’s a lot of hype surrounding him, and he’s definitely skilled beyond his peers. His parentage would suggest he will grow into an NBA body.  So, probably fair to say it’s a longshot (as anyone is in 8th grade), but he’s about as close to a sure thing as you can get at that age.

Second, the [CBA prohibits]( https://www.quora.com/Can-an-NBA-player-simultaneously-be-the-owner-of-his-team) anyone in ownership from concurrently playing for a team.  Michael Jordan famously had to sell his shares in WAS when he decided to come out of the front office and play for them.  But, as far as I know, there is nothing that prohibits a child from playing for their parent’s team.

Practically, this could make a *lot* of sense for Bronnie, especially if he’s an elite player.  The extra cap space could be used to maximize the talent around Jr. and the savings in luxury tax could be huge, given the multiplier.  Moreover, corporations get lower tax rates and can expense the money to save millions of dollars whereas players get hit with the max income tax bracket.  So, the James family would net more money by having Bronnie take the minimum.  Meanwhile, Bron could give Bronnie a family credit card to take care of whatever Jr. wanted to buy.

113	Here's why the Washington Wizards are the true heirs to the Eastern Conference throne	"Not long ago, I made a post declaring the Magic to be the best team in the Eastern Conference. After a couple of days to think about my clearly sound judgement of NBA-level talent, I realised something: Wizards are producers of magic, so how can Orlando possibly be better than a team that can master their weirdly abstract name? Outside of their branding-based superiority when compared to their South-Eastern rivals, I believe that this squad has the ability to win the NBA's ""At Least You Tried"" trophy after being sent to the shadow realm by the OmegaState UltimateWarriors in the finals. Without further ado, here's why the Wizards are the real beasts of the East:

\-Their massive offseason led them to add Austin ""Cry Me A"" River~~s~~, a man betrayed by his own father. He's hungrier than ever, and, with more to prove than ever, D.C. fans will be yelling [HERE COMES AUSTIN RIVERS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0LAgNwNmrc) at inopportune moments in no time.

\-They also splashed the cash on Dwight ""Positive locker-room presence"" Howard, a man with the shoulders to carry a team on offence, helped by his newly-found range from *deep* ([https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/dwight-howard-shooting-3s-practicing-video-off-the-dribble-stats-wizards-nba](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/dwight-howard-shooting-3s-practicing-video-off-the-dribble-stats-wizards-nba)). Washington, your spacing issues are solved. Plus, he's on Boogie money as well, so it's a good value...**wait**.

\-No way, they even signed Jeff ""Consistently inconsistent"" Green, the kind of player that teams would die for if they watched his annual amazing, mind-blowing game at a random point in the season. If that entire sentence made no sense to you and seemed a little paradoxical, that's Jeff Green in a nutshell.

Not much more needs to be said; stalwarts such as John ""He's just a little scruffy, that's all"" Wall and Otto ""Physical embodiment of shot-based efficiency"" Porter, Washington can finally say [sup to the Eastern Conference](https://twitter.com/washwizards/status/922668753372045312?lang=en) with confidence.

116	Case for Stephon Marbury in Hall of Fame	"I am gonna admit this is a very very long shot but I think Marbury deserves to be in the hall. If not for his NBA career then his work in China. You look at a lot of the guys in the hall now and Marbury put up comparable numbers for a very long time. Most importantly he was consistent. And despite how it ultimately ended, he took the risk to revive his career in China. I think what he did in China was great for basketball. He wasn’t some American baller who played a few games for money. He completely embraced the culture there and he just doesn’t get enough credit for what he did there.

I'm not sure that I'm asking the good community but maybe a fellow developper/nba fan could help.

I have an idea of a pet project about fantasy league for my own amusement and I thought I could do some requests to stats.nba.com in order to get some players statistics.

Sadly I can't do it programmaticaly.

First I tried with requesting threw https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ which worked on data.nba.net endpoint but not on the stats one. (All of this in JS)

I also tried to avoid doing my request from a browser and tried with Java and OKHttp but my requests always timed-out (30 seconds). If I do the request manually on a browser it works in 300ms.

If someone has faced those issues and want to share some knowledge, i'd be happy to hear them :)

* Pippen played close to his normal amount of minutes and put out an an [above average game in pts/reb/ast/stl on an impressively efficient 85/NA/100](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool). 

* Jordan on the other hand played only 28mins compared to his average 37 that season (interestingly MJ played all 82 games his final year too) which factored into his totals being lower than season average. However MJ did also shoot a nice 60/NA/100 for the game. [Tl;dr video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKe_vQExwvU)

People seem to like remembering Jordan's Bulls years, but not his wizard years since those Bulls years defined him. But that doesn't mean we should forget that Pippen is a pretty great player (who would be great in any era) and is officially undefeated against MJ. But then again, I don't even know [if Pippen remembers he beat MJ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NajCNHfQaiY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23)

151	Late night analysis: Who was the worst team ever?	"The NBA has had some really good teams. It has also had some really bad ones. Who was the worst? 

For the sake of comparison I'm only going to focus on the last ~20 years. While it would be funny to laugh about the Mike Woodson-led 86-87 Clippers, [and look at Michael Cage pictures] (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/91/9c/3a919c3806202c3fe42ea906e9c5d4b1.jpg), I just wasn't around then and can't fairly analyze how shitty they really were. 

Contenders:
1997-98 Nuggets (11-71)
2004-2005 Hawks (13-69)
2009-2010 Nets (12-70)
2011-2012 Bobcats (7-59)

All of these teams were hot garbage. Just ass. Here's the best starting 5 you can make by combining these teams:

Devin Harris
Gerald Henderson
LaPhonso Ellis
Al Harrington
Brook Lopez

Gross. 

97-98 Nuggets:
In 96-97 the Nuggets were bad. They lost 61 games and decided to trade Antonio McDyess and Dale Ellis. In came Eric Williams and Johnny Newman. Everyone knew this would be a rebuilding year, but when Williams got hurt 4 games into the season they really became a joke. After 40 games they were 2-38. Over the course of the season they only won 4 game against teams who finished over .500. 

After the season the dudes that ran the Nuggets back then got together and said ""that fucking sucked, we should just un-do it."" So they brought back McDyess after trading him a year earlier. They also drafted Raef LaFrentz instead of Vince Carter, Antawn Jamison, Paul Pierce, and Dirk. To top it off, they hired Mike D'Antoni as their head coach. They only won 14 games, but they got better, so the 1998-99 Nuggets are not on this list. 

The shit the 97-98 Nuggets put the great city of Denver through will not be forgotten or forgiven anytime soon. 

04-05 Hawks
As I alluded to earlier, Mike Woodson was the best player on one of the worst teams in history. 16 years later the Wooly Willy fuck was still cropdusting nasty basketball in our faces. 

OK, so the 03-04 Hawks sucked pretty bad, but it was obvious that signing Antoine Walker wasn't going to help. It was such a fucking disaster that they just traded him back to the Celtics mid-way through the season, who then *released* him and re-signed him as a way around the stupid Hawks giving him a payday in the offseason. 

Part of the reason the Hawks were so shitty is that their point guard rotation was Tyronn Lue and Royal Ivey. They realized they needed to fix that problem after their historically shitty 04-05, but instead of doing that they drafted Marvin Williams right in front of Deron Williams and Chris Paul. 

When the Hawks dumped Toine back on Boston, they acquired Gary Payton who said ""nah"". GP became the PG for the legendary club called ""Was on the Hawks, got paid by the Hawks, but didn't play for the Hawks"" 

09-10 Nets
This one is too sad to write about. Everything bad that's happened to the Nets can be traced back to this team in one way or another. The 09-10 Nets created a form of radioactive fallout from which emerged Billy King, and things did not turn out OK for anyone. 

11-12 Bobcats
I'm not convinced the Bobcats were ever real. Whenever I see Bobcats highlights something seems off. The colors of the uniforms, the players who played there (Adam Morrison? Matt Carroll?) Something deeper is happening that has manipulated our brains into remembering the Bobcats, but I'm telling you, it never happened. [Does this look like a real photo of an NBA team? Of course not] (https://static2.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Charlotte-Bobcats-worst-team-br.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=798&amp;h=407&amp;dpr=1.5)

Final rankings:
Best of the worst:
09-10 Nets (At least they beat the Knicks twice) 

Second Worst:
04-05 Hawks (There was some comedy)

Worst:
97-98 Nuggets (Still owe Denver an apology) 

N/A:
Bobcats (Not real)

158	[OC] Calculating Individual Offensive Ratings pre-1974	"A few weeks ago I put together [a method of calculating historical DRtg based on DWS](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/98u0ql/oc_calculating_individual_defensive_ratings/), along with [a top-10 list back as far as 1952](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/99r5mi/top_10_defensive_ratings_19521973xpost_from/).

Today I'm looking at the other side of the ball. Without turnovers and offensive rebounds, calculating [ORtg](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/off_rtg_yearly.html) the [traditional way](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html) is impossible. Fortunately, once again [Win Shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ows_yearly.html) has [an approximation](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html), which I've turned into the following formula:

    ORtg = 100*ModifiedPoints/ModifiedShotAttempts

where

&gt; ModifiedPoints = 
    2.0 * (field goals) * (1 - ((team assists) / (team field goals)))
    + 1.5 * (field goals) * ((team assists) / (team field goals))
    + 1.0 * (free throws)
    + 0.5 * (assists)

and

&gt; ModifiedShotAttempts =
    1.00 * (field goals) * (1 - ((team assists) / (team field goals)))
    + 0.50 * (field goals) * ((team assists) / (team field goals))
    + 1.00 * ((field goal attempts) - (field goals))
    + 0.44 * (free throw attempts)
    + 0.50 * (assists)

As this calculation is independent of minutes, we can track league leaders right back to the BAA:

But I wanted to know how barren the landscape has been, so I went back to see where the best players have played.  In 1997-1998, the Eastern Conference had 8/15 All-NBA players and Michael Jordan won his last MVP.  Since then, it's been pretty damn bad:

In the past 20 seasons, the Eastern Conference has 32/100 1st-Team, 32/100 2nd-Team, and 39/100 3rd-Team players.  That's very not good.

Tons of people have been commenting lately about how the Big 3 Celtics are overrated because they're talked about a lot but only won 1 title. But the truth is that the Celtics barely lost game 7 of the Finals and the refs favored the Lakers all series. You know it's bad when a neutral site like basketball-reference says that conspiracy theories have a solid case. 

It also should be mentioned that Bill Kennedy reffed in that series, and he had a beef with Doc Rivers at the time, and Doc had a poor record in games where he officiated. 

The Celtics shouldn't need to overcome a referee bias to win a series, and barely losing a game 7 in those circumstances shouldn't be a pockmark on their legacy.

226	"Was Richie Guerin the first ""Good Stats, Bad Team"" Guy in the NBA during his tenure with NYK?"	"I'd never heard of this dude until I found some interesting things in bball-reference.com. But he's a HOFer so shame on me for not being familiar with him, I guess.

***

Guerin had 6 straight all-star appearances form 1958-1963 including 3 All-NBA selections too. He was a SG who played his prime with the Knicks during that time. In New York he averaged 20.1-6.4-5.3 over 8 years, over those 8 years Guerin and the Knicks only had 2 playoff games. But he really peaked in 1962 when he averaged **29.5-6.4-6.9 on 44.2 FG%** I just wanted to point out some stats that I found interesting for him. 

I'd argue (perhaps ignorantly, or potentially naively) that no other HOFer played fewer playoff/meaningful games in their prime than Guerin. Thus making him the OG good stats, bad team guy.

***

**Richie Guerin 1961-1962 Stats: 29.5-6.4-6.9 - 2303 points, 501 rebounds, 539 assists in 78 GP**

The Good and The Bad:

 - Only other players with a 2000 point, 500 rebound, 500 assist season- LeBron (8x), Big O (6x), Larry Bird (3x), Harden (2x), Hondo (2x), MJ (2x), Brodie (2x)

 - 2303/501/539 Has been done 9 other times- Big O (3x), Harden (2x), LBJ (1x), Westbrook (1x), Hondo (1x), MJ (1x). Every player's team other than Guerin's was over .500 (Guerin's Knicks were .363).

  - MVP voting for Big O those 3 years- 3rd (1962), 1st (1964), 3rd (1966)

  - MVP voting for Harden those 2 years- 9th (2016), 2nd (2017)

  - MVP voting for Westbrook his year- 1st (2017)

  - MVP voting for MJ his year- 2nd (1989)

  - MVP voting for Hondo his year- 6th (1971)

  - MVP voting for Guerin in 1962- 7th 

 - Knicks went 29-51 tied for the second worst record in the NBA that season. Only Adrian Dantley and Guerin's contemporary, Walt Bellamy (also in 1962), have scored as many ppg and had a worse record. Bellamy and the Packers went 6-4 (.600 WP) against Guerin's Knicks and 12-58 (.171 WP) against the rest of the league.

Unrelated but somewhat interesting- his last season (1970) with Atlanta, he only scored 7 points total in 8 regular season games, but in 2 playoffs games he scored 33 (13/21 FG)."	nba
227	Who is the most overrated player heading into the 2018-19 NBA Season?	Personally I think it's Carmelo Anthony but he's sort of an obvious choice. He shoots terribly as shown by his 0.452TS% but again that is advanced stats. It's best to say that Melo has definitely dropped off the last few years. Melo is a pure scorer and not much else, he doesn't play defence, you could see his post game diminishing last season but that was probably because he was iso'ing a lot. Only thing he can do is score and that's what he's been his whole career, and even his efficiency in those terms is awful. Let me know your thoughts, I'm really interested to see what you guys think.	nba

266	I think I discovered the worst, goofiest NBA player ever: Gary Suiter, of the 1971 expansion Cavs	"I stumbled upon an anecdote or two about Suiter a few years ago and found him fascinating, so I decided to make a [YouTube video/mini-doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ElxAqYuOY) about his short career. And, I feel confidant in saying that if he's not the worst NBA player of all time, he might as well be. He's a completely obscure player - his Wikipedia article is like two sentences long and it took some digging to find a single high-res picture of him, but he had a really, REALLY weird, interesting career. He averaged 1.4 points per game on 35% shooting in just 30 career games for a really terrible Cavs team (they lost their first 15 games) and was finally waived for either stealing from his teammates.... or for eating a hot dog in the stands in his uniform instead of being on the court, or both. He also had a tendency to run into doors and accidentally lock himself in rooms.

In other words, Gary Suiter is like if JaVale McGee and JR Smith did the fusion dance, but did it badly and lost all their skills, and then got into hiring prostitutes and trying to rob people instead of improving their game. And if that doesn't fit the profile of the worst player ever, I don't know what does."	nba

Jason Kidd was an all around PG who did everything at a high level with a genius IQ level

Steve Nash was one of the best shooting and passing PGs of all time and set a precedent for what the league has become today. PLus he has 2x MVP to his name.

And although Grant Hill may not have reached his true peak, he was a monster early in his career and was being touted as the next MJ.

270	Kobe Bryant In Today's Game	"**Intro**

Just a fun project I decided to test out but I’ve been seeing posts about how a previous player would do today, I chose to do a statistical analysis of Kobe Bryant. My calculations just show how monstrous of a scorer Kobe Bryant was. The way I calculated it was I adjusted Kobe Bryant’s stats to today’s NBA pace which is 97.3 for 2018. For example, Kobe Bryant’s MVP year of 2007-2008 played at a pace of 92.4, which means Kobe Bryant’s MVP stats will increase when converted to 2018’s pace.

First off, we need to take into account that these stats don't adjust the increased volume of 3s players take nowadays compared to before. So if anything, the stats shown here could technically be higher but the numbers are a good starting point to show how impressive Kobe was as a scorer. Here is a chart of notable Kobe’s points per game throughout his career when converted to 2018’s pace. I will also provide a text breakdown below.

|Giannis Antetokounmpo|23|26.9|
|Stephen Curry|30|26.4|
|Kevin Durant|29|26.4|

&amp;#x200B;

**ANALYSIS**

* Kobe only averaged a measly “23.5” points per game when he won his first championship. What’s impressive about it is that he did that at the age of 21. For reference, in 2018 a 21 year old Devin Booker averaged 24.9 points per game as the primary option on offense while Kobe was second to Shaq at this time. Also understand that Kobe came off a broken wrist at the start of the season resulting in missing the first 15 games.
* In the following year Kobe matched MVP James Harden PPG of 30.4 while Kobe was six years younger at age 22 versus James Harden being in his prime of 28. Kobe at age 28 would average 31.6 points per game in today’s game.
* At age 23 Kobe would see a reduction only scoring 27 points per game, but it resulted in a third championship. Even at 27 PPG it would place him 4th among today’s scoring leaders behind James Harden, Anthony Davis, and LeBron James.
* At age 27 was Kobe’s best scoring years. Loosely translating to good stats on a bad team, Kobe had record breaking usage which resulted in Kobe averaging an absurd **38.1** points per game in today’s game. That is almost 8 more points than the next leading scorer. Scoring 81 points in one game definitely helped this case.
* In Kobe’s MVP season you see a dip of 27.6 points per game but Kobe reached the Finals for the first time without Shaq. But with a depleted Lakers roster ended up losing to the Celtics.
* In the 2009 season Kobe’s body is beginning to wither down from all the mileage and injuries but still increased his scoring output to 28.4 points at the age of 30, and winning his first championship without Shaq. It’s impressive that he’s doing this while battling injuries, specifically a broken index finger on his shooting hand.
* Kobe maintains his scoring consistency averaging 28.3 points per game in the 2010 en route to his 5th and final championship.
* At the age of 34 Kobe had an MVP season, carrying a injured superstar cast averaging 28.9 points per game, willing the Lakers into a playoff spot but at the cost of his achilles. LeBron just recently averaged 27.5 points per game at the age of 33 which is highly impressive in itself but I’m curious to see if LeBron can do it next year at age 34 (Kobe average 29.7 PPG at age 33).

**CONCLUSION**

Kobe Bryant is one of the deadliest scorers of all time, and is on the greatest players of all time. Again, I want to point out that these stats still didn't account for the increased volume of 3s so these stats might go even higher! If someone wants is able to figure out those calculations or if you want to update this content, feel free to. Hope you enjoyed the post!

**EDIT**

Also just to add for fun here is Michael Jordan's PPG stats during his two three peats when adjusted to 2018's pace.

292	Mindboggling how near-perfect Jordan's basketball story was.	"Started out as an underdog in high school in the JV squad. 

Then in college learned discipline and control under one of the great college coaches in Dean Smith and hit a game winning shot for an NCAA title.

When he got to the NBA, started dominating at an individual level from the get go. Selected as an All Star AND All NBA 2nd team in his rookie year!!

Both him and the Bulls steadily improved and after Scottie's emergence as an all nba player, they only lost once more (1995 playoffs) as a duo. 

Also you'd think since they won 6 they must've been stacked and destroyed the competition. But there were a LOT of close games throughout on many championship runs (besides the first one). A lot of their finals wins were also in the single digits leading to close and exciting finishes, something that's rare nowadays. 

Would've been the perfect story if he ended there and never went to the Wizards but hey nothings perfect lol. His competitive nature would not allow him to just sit by watch while he was still at an nba level and healthy. 

And this is just his story, his stats and awards are just in a category by itself. Truly the GOAT. "	nba

**Introduction**

The current Basketball Hall of Fame is just that, a hall of fame for anyone who has made a great contribution to the game of basketball. This is not only limited to play on the court in the NBA, but also play in college and internationally, coaching and management at all levels, and media personalities.

This exercise is so that [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) may have its own hall of fame based only on playing accomplishments in the NBA (and ABA in some cases). The goal of this is to have a much more exclusive club of NBA greats. The Basketball Hall of Fame has inductees every year, but the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) hall of fame will have inductees every week this offseason.

**How will it work?**

The first class will be composed of players who retired in 1960 or earlier. The second class will be composed of players who retired 1965 and earlier. The third class will be composed of players who retired 1970 and earlier, and so on.

The players listed must have higher than 20% hall of fame probability according to basketball-reference (just so that the ballots don't become too cluttered).

Each voter will get to choose between 1-5 players who they believe should make the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Any player who gets 50% or more of the vote will be inducted into the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Players who receive between 10% and 49.9% of the vote will be eligible in the next class.

Players who receive less than 10% of the vote will move down to the secondary ballot.

The same process is repeated for the secondary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the primary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will move down to the tertiary ballot.

The same process is again repeated for the tertiary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the secondary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will be ineligible for all future ballots. Also, players who receive 75% or more will skip the secondary and move straight to the primary ballot. New blood will be brought to this ballot from players who have more than 2% but less than 20% hall of fame probability.

Every other day the ballot will be posted as well as the results from the previous two days.

At the end of each week the inductees, their percentage of the votes, and whether they were first ballot, second ballot, etc will be posted as well as the ballot for the next class."	nba

I definitely think he’ll take a massive step back considering how bad of a track record Achilles injuries have on detailing careers. I wouldn’t be shocked if he never gets back to 75% of the player he was pre-injury. 

His measurements and body type don’t bode well for recovering from the injury either. Having measurements of 6’11, between 280 and 290 lbs puts a lot of stress on his body especially when recovering from a foot injury.

354	The Top 1000 Player Seasons Since 1996	"Hey what’s going on everyone. Been working on this project for a little while now and finally been able to finish it and format it to the best of my ability. Basically what this model does is rate players from 0 to 10,000 using just by using stats found on basketball-reference.com. To combat the overuse of advanced statistics, I broke down some stats into 6 “skills” (Playmaking, Shooting, Scoring, Pure Hooping, Rebounding, &amp; Defense) and rated each skill 0 to 100. On a side note, for defense I had to go outside basketball reference and use DRAPM and On/Off Defensive Rating Difference to yield more accurate results. Also, this is strictly unbiased and not my personal assessment of these players. It’s strictly based on statistics.

## Qualification

To qualify for a rating, a player had to at least to play 825 minutes in that specific regular season year. For this reason, I decided not use the 1998-99 and 2011-12 seasons in this project(for now) as they played a shorter schedule. I also used playoff statistics as a measure and included the previous season’s playoff schedule for a larger sample size(For instance, the 2017-18 regular season included 2016-17 and 2017-18 playoff statistics.) Also must have 55 minutes played in the postseason to have playoffs considered.

## Results

**Most Seasons in the Top 250, including best year and rating:**

**(13) Lebron James:2009-10, 10902**

**(12) Kobe Bryant:2005-06, 9343**

**(11) Dirk Nowitzki:2005-06, 9407**

**(9) Chris Paul:2007-08, 9961**

**(9) Tim Duncan:2002-03, 9147**

355	Is Kawhi Leonard and O.G Anunoby a top 5 defensive duo in the NBA?	What defensive duos can be considered better? I think they are being underated hard considering the Raptors last year have a top 5 defense and O.G was their first option on defense. Thoughts?	nba
356	Tim Duncan Story	"Just found this great story about Tim Duncan.

&gt;Former NBA player Etan Thomas, who played against Duncan during his time in the NBA, shared a great story on him playing against Duncan.  
&gt;  
&gt;“So we’re playing the Spurs and I get the ball on the post. I inside pivot and sweep to the middle for my jump hook and he blocks it,” Thomas wrote on his Facebook page.  
&gt;  
&gt;“So as we are running down the court he says to me – ‘that was a good move but you have to get more into my body so you can either draw the foul or I can’t block it’,” Thomas said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“So I didn’t know if he was talking noise or what so just kind of looked at him confused and said ok. Then, a few plays later I did it again got more into his body and he couldn’t block it,” Thomas said. “I missed the shot and he looked at me and said much better and kept playing.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Tim Duncan is honestly one of the nicest guys in the NBA and one of the best power forwards ever. Respect,” said Thomas.

359	How much would you pay D'Angelo Russell?	"Russell's value is the toughest to judge among the top 5 of the 2015 draft. He's extension eligible right now and will be a restricted free agent next summer if he doesn't sign one. The Nets have been in the business of offering up big offer sheets to RFAs from other teams for the last few years, but now they find themselves on the other side of that equation. 

What kind of contract would you give to Russell? What's the highest value that Brooklyn should match?"	nba
360	"Definition of ""Superstar"" in the NBA"	"There are a lot of varied definitions for this word. IMO I view it as players who could bring a collection of decent role players/lower VORP players to the playoffs (no other stars). This list would probably consist of (based on past evidence and belief that they could achieve this feat):


* Lebron James
* Stephen Curry
* Kevin Durant
* Anthony Davis
* Giannis Antetokounmpo
* James Harden
* Russell Westbrook
* Kawhi Leonard


Any other players who would fit in this category?"	nba
361	Why is Grant Hill in the HOF but not Chris Webber?	"Hill in his prime before the injuries averaged **21.6pts/7.9reb/6.3ast**, he made 6 All Star Teams (he made one of them while only playing 4 games that season). He was 1x All NBA 1st Team and 4x All NBA 2nd team 


Webber in his prime averaged **22.8pts/10.4reb/4.3ast** and is a 5x All Star . He was 1x All NBA 1st Team and 3x All NBA 2nd Team and 1x All NBA 3rd Team



They have extremly similar resumes, but Webber had a much longer prime. The majority of Hills career was as a role player. Why is Webber not in the HOF? "	nba

I hope to finish this by the time the season begins. So we'll do 1 a day up until Day 7, then we'll vote on positions 8-10 at once. So every 8 days, we'll have one position list done. In hopes of squeezing everything in time and giving myself some leverage in case I miss I day, we'll automatically fill in the GOAT PG (Magic) and GOAT SG (Jordan) as those seem to be the 2 most undeniable. Every day, I'll post results then fill in the empty spot with another player.

364	Thoughts on this lineups potential against GS in a 7 Game Series	"- Oladipo  
- Butler  
- PG  
- Leonard  
- Davis  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
How does this lineup do in a 7 Game series against a current healthy GS? This lineup provides the following  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
- Spacing  
- Average/Above Average playmaking at all positions  
- Elite switching defense  
- Scoring at all positions  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
The only weaknesses I really see with this lineup that I could see being exploited are Rebounding and maybe outside shooting, although PG and Leonard are both above average 3 point shooters. Thoughts on how you think that series would play out? How close do you think it is? 
"	nba
365	A Simple Question.	"Right now, with everything you own at stake, would you take any of the Raptors, Sixers, Thunder, Jazz to beat the L.A Lakers in a playoff series? Would you bet against LeBron?

This is in response to the post that asked people to state their top 5 teams in the NBA, of which the L.A Lakers were absent from nearly all posts. I want some confirmation that people would do this. "	nba
366	Who was the closest matched set of rivals of all time?	"The NBA has had some great rivalries, no doubt. But a truly GOAT rivalry, IMO, comes when either player could reasonably be argued as better. IMO the top 3 are 

Duncan and Kobe

Magic and Bird

Dirk and Wade (loose definition of rivals, but they faced each other twice in the finals, and have similar achievements as well, IMO)

What rivalries do y'all think were really close?

Edit: to clarify, I'm not saying these are the top 3 rivalries. Im saying they're the top 3 closest rivalries."	nba
367	Which All-Defensive teams did Kobe not deserve?	"Kobe has the 2nd most All-Defensive team selections of all time. And I always see people mentioning that he didn't deserve a lot of them. Which ones?

371	The Story of the NBA Player who Disappeared	"Brian Williams played 2 seasons at the University of Arizona before being drafted in the first round of the 1991 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic. After bouncing around the league, he was signed by the Bulls for the last 9 games of the 1996-97 season, becoming an important bench piece as they won their 5th NBA championship. Williams was then traded to Detroit, where he averaged career highs of 16.2 ppg and 8.9 rpg. It was during this period that he changed his name to Bison Dele in order to honor his Cherokee heritage. Dele, who was known for his eccentric behavior, suddenly retired from the NBA in an odd fashion. He retired before the start of the 1999–2000 season at age 30, when he was still in the prime of his career. He had been the Pistons' highest-paid player, but decided to walk away from the remaining five years and US$36.45 million on his contract rather than be traded. 

After retiring, Dele bought a boat that he named the *Hukuna Matata,* or ""Good Times."" On July 6, 2002, Dele, his brother Miles Dabord, his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and the captain of the boat set sail from Tahiti. On July 20, Dabord bought the boat into Tahiti. He was alone, no one else on the boat was ever seen again. Dabord was caught on September 5 in Arizona when police discovered that he had bought $152,000 worth of gold by using his brother's name and passport as his identification and forging his signature. 2 days earlier, the *Hukuna Matata* was found with its name plate removed and some possible bullet holes patched. That same day, Dabord called his mother, telling her that he would never hurt Bison and that he could not survive life in prison. The FBI and French authorities eventually concluded that Dele, Karlan and the captain were probably killed and then thrown overboard, or forced to walk off the boat into the ocean, by Dabord. Given that the bodies were likely dumped in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it would be highly unlikely that the three would ever be found. Investigators were never able to properly question Dabord though, because he intentially overdosed on insulin, falling into a coma, and eventually dying in a California hospital on September 27, 2002."	nba

382	Are people sleeping on the Sixers future?	"Ever since Boston beat the Sixers in 5 last season, people have (sort of) put a cap on the Sixers ceiling. Their basis is normal questions, like whether Simmons will be able to shoot, will Embiid stay healthy, what's up with Fultz etc. Add to this that Boston is adding (bringing back) a couple of all-stars, and Toronto added Leonard, the popular vote is down on the Sixers future. 

Personally, I think it's far far brighter that either Toronto, and higher than Boston. This isn't based in advanced stats, just a basic ability to see trends. 

1) It's fair to assume that Simmons will learn to shoot, at least half-decently. i.e.- 40% from the field. Not earth shattering, but it'll be enough to keep defences honest, and him making them pay to slack off on him. Factor this in with his ability to get to anyplace on the court irrespective of who'd guarding him, and his handle &amp; court vision, he'll be a decade long all-star, in my humble opinion. 

2) Embiid does not have any holes. He can rebound, he can shoot from deep, he can guard in the post, and even come out to defend in the perimeter (he actually tried to guard Thomas once; didn't fare well, but shows how confident he is in his perimeter defending). Again, it's fair to assume that his injury issues are behind him. 

3) Fultz with the *yips* is a common ground to shit on his future. People tend to forget that he still has his handle, he still has the spin moves, his first step is still quick. If he can develop jump shot that's even remotely competent, he'd be a starter at worst. 

These aren't even the deciding factors in predicting the Sixers future. More is on record as saying that the biggest problem is finding that star. After that, things fall into place. That was his critical reasoning in landing Harden. Subsequently, they managed to land D'Antoni, convince Paul &amp; Anthony etc. It all started with Harden. Sixers have two of those on the team right now. Is it impossible to imagine Porzingis getting tired of the shit in New York and wanting out? Like (or admit) it or not, there are still legit questions regarding the Bucks &amp; the Suns. If any one of these teams struggle or stagger, not only will the star want out, the Sixers will be the first place he/ they'll look to.

The best part is how they all fit *perfectly* with the Sixers duo. Porzingis wouldn't need to worry about bulking up &amp; playing a 5. Just face the basket &amp; play off Embiid. You could fit Booker or Giannis anywhere in that line-up (2-4, depending on how they're playing). All their games complement perfectly to what the Sixers duo bring to the table. 

Then you have the assets that the Sixers have accumulated. All their first rounders intact, a boat-load of second rounders to throw-in, and some enticing contracts to trade away. Saric &amp; Covington are team friendly deals, and would appeal to anyone looking for 3-D/ role players. i.e.- If the opportunity presents itself, the Sixers might not even have to wait for free agency. 

In short, the Sixers are far, far better placed to run the league than people can imagine. "	nba

395	[OC] I made a list of theme songs to represent every NBA team	"I got bored during the offseason, so I put together a list of all the teams and the song that I think best represents each team. The biggest challenge is that most songs are about extremes: sadness, happiness...etc, and it's just hard to find songs for the remaining ~25 teams that fall in the middle of that spectrum. For some of them, it's about the title, or the lyrics, or just something random about the song that I think fits your team.

Also, I probably don't watch your team play, so don't get mad at me if you don't like the song your team got. Go make your own list.

**Atlanta Hawks**

[Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

♬ Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down ♬

Boasting the lowest attendance in the league as the team is retooling while remaining competitive, if you're still a die-hard fan at this point, let's face it, you're never gonna give up on this team. Also, the Hawks sub has the best memes and this song is basically one of the OG internet memes.

**Boston Celtics**

[Seven Nation Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY)

New Zealand - Aron Baynes

Australia - Kyrie Irving

Dominican Republic - Al Horford

Egypt - Abdel Nader

Germany - Daniel Theis

France - Guerschon Yabusele

USA - Everyone else

(2017 roster)

**Brooklyn Nets**

[99 Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go8ljH1P3_0)

I just want to be mostly positive about your team here. You guys don't do so well on the basketball court, but at least there's no serious team drama going around (as far as we know). Also, you had Jeremy Lin in your locker room, so that's a plus in terms of the off court thing. Also also, Jay Z used to own a part of the Nets.

**Charlotte Hornets**

[Toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU)

♬ A guy like you, Should wear a warning, It's dangerous ♬

♬ I love what you do. Don't you know that you're toxic ♬

Dwight Howard: Sixth in league in screen assists, sick post moves, locker room cancer. Alternative song choice: Radioactive by Imagine Dragons

**Chicago Bulls**

[Yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uneYz201p0)

♬ Oh I believe in Yesterday ♬

A storied franchise with a rich history and possibly one of the greatest peaks of all time. Now reduced to a team chastised by the league for blatantly tanking for a better pick. We'll see how Lauri pans out, but in the meantime, I'd believe in yesterday too.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

[Time of Your Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnQ8N1KacJc)

You had a great run. Greatest player of this generation (and possibly ever) lifted you out of mediocrity. Then left you. Then came back and won a championship for you in one of the greatest comebacks in all of sports history.

♬ It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right ♬

♬ I hope you had the time of your life ♬

**Dallas Mavericks**

[Circle of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwH9YvhPN7c)

From Dirk shocking the world by defeating the season favorites Miami Heat in 2011 to Mark Cuban basically admitting that it's in the best interests of the team to tank last year, the Mavs have fallen far. Persisting through despair and hope, through faith and love, Luka Doncic has come to complete the circle of life.

**Denver Nuggets**

[Dark Horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0)

I don't know much about the Nuggets except that they regularly kick our ass twice a year. No idea how the IT signing is going to change the team chemistry, but they definitely seem like they're going to make the West playoffs this year. If Jokic stays healthy and continues to develop, and IT returns to MVP candidate form, they could be a dark horse contender to give even top teams like the Warriors and the Rockets some trouble in the playoffs.

**Detroit Pistons**

[Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Dg-g7t2l4)

♬ Hello darkness my old friend, I've come to talk with you again ♬
Consistently voted by /r/nba to be the team with the bleakest future, but hey, at least you have Blake Griffin to boost your attendance numbers. 

♬ And in the naked light I saw ♬ 

♬ Ten ~~thousand~~ people, maybe more ♬ 

**Golden State Warriors**

[We Are the Champions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY)

🏆 Yea 🏆

**Houston Rockets**

[Another Brick in the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U)

I could pick a song relating to Harden's MVP. Or how they exceeded most fans' expectations and took Golden State to 7 games even with CP3 down. But nah, this is about the worst 3 point shooting stretch in playoff history at 27 bricks from downtown.

♬ Just another brick in the wall... just another brick in the wall... ♬

**Indiana Pacers**

[In The End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4)

This can be said for the Pacers pretty much every time you've had to meet LeBron in the playoffs since 2012. David West, Paul George, Victor Oladipo. You fooled us each year, into thinking that there'd be a new king of the East. You all tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. This song is for you. With LeBron gone, and dipo's work ethic, next year is the year you make it deep in the playoffs.

**LA Clippers**

[Mad World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4)

With the Blake Griffin trade at the deadline, it appears the Clippers have boarded the train to tanktown. While sometimes it may feel like there's no tomorrow no tomorrow, hey, at least they still haven't tried to move your team to Seattle yet. And you have the logo figuring things out for you, and from what we hear, he was a big piece of this Warriors dyansty so maybe it'll work out for you.

**LA Lakers**

[One Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1xs_xPb46M)

♬ You've got that one thing, You've got that one thing ♬

Congrats on winning the 2018 LeBron James sweepstakes. While it appears that the rest of your squad is either young developing players you refused to send to San Antonio for Kawhi (good decision by Magic imo) or basically memes, and while you're kind of disappointed that PG didn't even give your offer a consideration, you've got that One Thing that makes you a contender.

**Miami Heat**

[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkK8g6FMEXE)

You had a dynasty. It was a great run. What you have left of it now are your coach and Dwyane Wade, who may or may not be retiring soonish. Cherish the time you have left hovering around the 6-8th seed for the next few years before Pat Riley decides to blow it all up and enter tank mode.

Giannis Antetokounmpo. Dat euro step.

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

[I Will Survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYkACVDFmeg)

The Wolves' starters played a combined 175+ minutes a game, most in the NBA by a large margin. It seems like Thibs subscribes to a philosophy of playing every regular season game like a playoff game, which seemed to have paid off in the edge-of-the-seat season finale against the Nuggets for the 8th seed. They have the rest of their lives to give. They will survive.

♬ Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play ♬

I just feel like this song simply represents the Thunder. Last year, the Thunder got the Big 3 stars. This year, addition by subtraction. You still have Steven Adams, one of the top star centers, and Roberson is going to come back with his intangibles. Russ definitely plays like he believes in the lyrics of this song ♬ Only shooting stars break the mould. ♬

**Orlando Magic**

[Somewhere Over the Rainbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU)

This is about your decade long rebuild since Dwightmare. Always looking beyond the horizon for that next star that's going to make you relevant when everyone else in your area is rooting for the Heat. Mo Bamba looks legit though. Maybe he'll be the one that finally carries you over the rainbow.

**Philadelphia Sixers**

[Holding Out for a Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcASV2sey0)

You guys were bad, but the badness was planned, calculated. And now it looks like it's somewhat paying off, and you've gone from a 10 win team to Eastern Conference contenders. What you really needed to go over the top was just one more super star next to Simmons and Embiid. Didn't get one this year but we'll see whether you can pull one next year. 

The criteria: 

♬ He's gotta be strong, he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight ... He's gotta be sure, he's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life. ♬

The nation's song for the team from the nation's capital, a team that used to be called the Bullets. Jokes and sadness aside, I really do respect John Wall for his charitable donations to help the homeless and Markieff Morris for his recent backpack giveaway event inspired by LeBron's donation to his school. Other NBA teams also have stars that dedicate their time and resources to help improve the country that they live in, and that to me, is what makes this league so great."	nba

398	The myth that Jordan was not a great passer	Jordan is actually one of the goat passing non PG’s of all time. Thing is that he played in the triangle offense, which promotes ball smoovement. The big mans assists go up while the guards goes down. Shaq had his best passing seasons in the triangle.  Jordan averaged a good 5.7 apg in his playoff career despite playing 1/3 of his games from 33-35. LeBron from 2006-2016 playoffs averaged 6.8 apg on 3.5 tov. Jordan averaged 6.5 apg on 3.4 tov. He was almost as good a passer as LeBron (and blows him out the water at everything else). He averaged a triple double at PG, and 11.4 apg in the finals before. He is a top 10 passer of all time arguably.	nba

Westbrook can be overrated AND a top 7 player in the NBA. Overrated doesn't mean bad. Can we please stop treating it like it does?"	nba

403	2019 NBA Draft Prospect Primer: R.J. Barrett	"**R.J. Barrett**

Height: 6’7”

Weight: 208 lbs

Age: 18

Position: SG/SF

College: Duke

**Pros:**

- Great athleticism

- Highly confident

- Puts in a lot of effort

- Exemplary playmaker

- Solid defender

- Very versatile

**Cons:**

- Mediocre lower body

- Not as explosive as expected

- Raw handles

- Relies on his length too much

- Streaky shooter

- Can be somewhat questionable at times

- Slouches off the ball

- Looks uninterested sometimes

**Verdict:**

Barrett is projected to be the 1st overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. I can see him going with that pick but if he doesn’t improve on his cons, his draft stock could lower. I project Atlanta to have the #1 pick and take Barrett, and play him at SF.

404	Is Udonis Haslem the second greatest Heat ever?	"(Obviously behind D-Wade)
Here’s some of his pedigree: 


- Haslem has been a role player on all 3 of Miami’s championships in franchise history. 

- NBA All Rookie Second Team

- master of  mid-range shooting 

- Franchise leader in rebounds 

- Started at PF for every playoff game during Miami’s 2006 Championship run, scoring 17 in the series clinching Game 6 win. 

- Turned away more money to remain with the team despite signing Chris Bosh and LeBron James and given a smaller role.

- this will be his 16th season for Miami

- only undrafted player in NBA history to be franchise rebounding leader 

I say just because of his longevity and loyalty, he barely edges out Alonzo Mourning for the 2 spot. Comparing them as players, obviously Mourning is much better as a player but Udonis has done more for the franchise. I’d say LeBron James and Tim Hardaway are 4 &amp; 5 respectively. 
Thoughts? "	nba
405	Which Underrated Player Do You Like?	"I really wish Josh Richardson or Luke Kennard were on the Magic. Josh Richardson next to Isaac, Bamba and AG would be fun to watch and he could train with Frazier. Luke Kennard is underrated he shoot over 40% from three as a rookie and is an elite shooter. At 6'6 even with his average defense he would be able to space the floor and be similar to Kyle Korver. 

Josh Richardson and Luke Kennard would be the two underrated players I like the most."	nba
406	Who says no ? NYK or MIN ?	"Knicks trade : Joakim Noah and Enes Kanter

407	What are the chances that Curry can surpass Kobe?	"Obviously the argument favors Kobe so I was wondering what you guys thought? 10%? 25%?

He already won 2 MVP's (1st unanimous) and 1 ring before KD got there. You could argue his offensive talents surpass Kobe's. Plus another 2 rings will more likely coming. And his influence on modern NBA is pretty significant.

But Kobe's longevity as well as defensive reputation is hard to match.

**EDIT:** For reference, here is what each accomplished by 29 (Curry's age)

||Kobe|Curry|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Rings**|3|3|
|**Finals**|5|4|
|**MVP**|1|2|
|**All NBA**|10|5|
|**All Defense**|6|0|
|**Scoring Title**|2|1|
|**All Star**|10|5|
|**International**|1 Olympic Gold, 1 FIBA Gold|2 FIBA Golds|
|**Other**|81 point game, 3 point record (surpassed by Curry), bunch of ""youngest"" records|Steals Title, 50-40-90 club, bunch of 3 point records, 73-9 team|

I can see Curry potentially matching what Kobe did during his 30's (even surpassing total ring count) but not sure if he can make up the difference for his 20's. My guess is 10%"	nba
408	Why not get rid of draft picks and let teams bid for players through contracts?	"Essentially, draft eligible players can be bidded on. The largest amount rookie length contract bidded(no money limit) gets the player. This makes sense because the worst teams tend to have the most cap space. This also allows rookie players to have no restriction on money allowing them to receive as much as teams wanna give them useful in the case a player of like LeBron’s caliber enters the league.

This would get rid of tanking as you have no reason to tank if you have the cap space.

It would also allow teams to plan for certain players. Ex. They see a player in the next years draft that they want, they spend the season clearing cap space.

445	Does having All-star/All-NBA teammates help with efficiency?	"One of the most common myth in this sub is ""If A player has another star teammate(s), his efficiency will surely go up"", or ""A player is only scoring that efficienly with that volume due to his having help from other stars"". 

While it's theoretically sound, that star teammates demand more of opponents' defense focus, it doesn't often hold up in the current NBA. Check Westbrook and Lebron stats in the 2016-2017 and the 2017-2018 seasons:

**Westbrook**

2016-17: **31.6ppg** on **55.4% TS** in Regular Season; **37.4ppg** on **55.1% TS** in Playoffs

2017-18: **25.4ppg** on **52.4% TS** in Regular Season; **29.3ppg** on **49.3% TS** in Playoffs

Westbrook's volume and efficiency both go down despite adding All-star/All-NBA star Paul George, contrary to the popular belief that his points and efficiency would go up with an addition of a borderline superstar teammate in PG13.

**Lebron**

2016-17: **26.4ppg** on **61.9% TS** in the Regular Season; **32.8ppg** on **64.9% TS** in the Playoff.

2017-18: **27.5ppg** on **62.1% TS** in the Regular Season; **34ppg** on **61.9% TS** in the Playoff.

Despite losing All-star teammate Kyrie Irving, Lebron's scoring volume and efficiency go up in the 2017-18 Regular season. His playoff scoring volume goes up but his efficiency also goes down a bit. So Lebron's scoring has actually gone up with the loss of an All-star teammate.

Therefore, I don't agree when someone says that KD has only been able to score the volume and efficiency he does because he is on Golden State, ignoring his absurdly high TS% in OKC and also ignoring his development as a player. Also I don't buy the hypothesis that if you surround Lebron or Westbrook with more All-star teammates, their scoring will become better volume-wise and efficiency-wise."	nba
446	Dirk Nowitzki is 6th on the all-time scoring list, but he only finished top 5 in scoring in 2 seasons of his career.	"Inspired by the Karl Malone post, I was interested in looking into Dirk's scoring:

The highest Dirk ever finished in an individual season was 4th place, both in 2005 and 2009. 

His highest PPG average was 26.6 PPG in the 2006 season, but funnily enough, he only finished 7th in scoring that season. 

He also only averaged 25+ PPG 5 times in his career, and only took around 16-17 shots per game throughout his career.

I think it's amazing how Dirk is 6th all-time despite all of this, through his consistency and durability."	nba

459	Advanced Stats Question - Omitting Players for Defensive Ratings	"So I'm an advanced stats newbie, but I'm trying to get into it in order to do some of my own basketball analytics.

Does anybody know if there's a way to calculate a Team's Defensive Rating when omitting one or multiple specific players? In other words, are there any stats or formulas to see if a team's defence is better or worse if you were to remove certain individuals from their roster? I'm thinking of something like Real Plus Minus, but for the Defensive Rating stat, or even for something like Team Defensive Rebounding Percentage without said players.

Specifically, I'm curious to see how much Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green contributed to the Spurs' defence in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons (since Kawhi sat out most of 2017-18 I'm less interested in that season). Naturally, they are good defensive players and so one would assume the Spurs will be worse defensively without them. I'd like to have a quantifiable way of comparing what it would have been like for the team to function on defence without them (as they will in the upcoming season).

Thank you in advance!"	nba

469	LeBron James is gonna focus on one of two things this season.	"#1 He will have worked on his cardio this offseason to improve his late game play. 
#2 He’s going to focus more on defense to help out his younger team. 

LeBron scoring is bound to happen, no matter what, but his new team will be able to help put up points more than his last team was. Because of this he won’t have to worry about being the #1 option on offense and the main ball handler. Look for him to average less points, but still be a playmaker and up his defense. That’s just my take. "	nba

Look for Orlando to be very active in the trade market towards the deadline. If they are able to clear the minutes up, there’s some nice pieces here. A bit of a log jam in some positions, I do expect them to figure that out. 
  As for Mo, there’s a reason why he has so many hoes calling him on his phone. Dude is a straight baller and can grow into not their Dwight replacement but a fairly good center. That can help improve their defense and grab some boards. "	nba

To make this post long enough im gonna post the bio of the 2 GOAT Rappers of all time

&amp;#x200B;

Tupac Shakur  

**Tupac Amaru Shakur** ([/ˈtuːpɑːk ʃəˈkʊər/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [*TOO-pahk shə-KOOR*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key); born **Lesane Parish Crooks**; June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his [stage names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name) **2Pac** and **Makaveli**,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-1) was an American [rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping) and actor.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-2) He is considered by many as one of the best rappers of all time.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-bet.com-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-RS-4)

Shakur was born in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, but relocated to Los Angeles in 1988. When he released his debut album [*2Pacalypse Now*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Pacalypse_Now) in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop, introducing social issues in the genre at a time when gangsta rap was dominant in the mainstream.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-TSTA-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-TSHSD-6) Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with [*Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_4_My_N.I.G.G.A.Z...) (1993) and [*Me Against the World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Against_the_World) (1995).[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-HTP-330-7) Later that year, after suffering [legal troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#Legal_issues) and a [robbery and shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#Attack_at_Quad_Recording_Studios), Shakur became heavily involved in the growing [East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry).[\[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur#cite_note-8)

**Diego Leanos** (born September 6, 1996), known professionally as **Lil Xan**, is an American [rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping), [singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing) and [songwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter) from [Redlands, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlands,_California).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Xan#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Xan#cite_note-5) He is best known for his breakout hit, platinum certified[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Xan#cite_note-6) ""[Betrayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betrayed_(Lil_Xan_song))"", which peaked at no. 64 on the [*Billboard*Hot 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100).

This record can only be broken if someone scores in exactly 0.3 seconds, since the league passed The Trent Tucker Rule, which disqualifies teams from attempting a shot if there are less than 0.3 seconds on the clock.

Also, the video kind of shows it, but after the shot, all the Lakers immediately ran to the locker room so that the refs couldn't review the play."	nba
500	Everyone thinks Tom Thibodeau is crazy for chasing former Bulls but...	"What if this was all planned out?

It seems all his former players started sucking at the same time. Maybe they planned it all out to try and get back together with Thibs since the Bulls front office screwed over that team hard.

Less than two years ago Noah was still a good player. He's just had problems with a couple injuries.

Two years ago Luol Deng had 6.4 win shares which would easily be 4th best on the Timberwolves last season. He got shipped off to the Lakers thinking he'd be in a good spot but they didn't play him how he should be played and he lost interest playing on a tanking Lakers team.

A year ago Derrick Rose had 3.0 win shares which would've put him 6th on the Timberwolves last season. This is after finally staying somewhat healthy for an extended period of time. He showed up in playoff Rose fashion and was a huge boost to our bench.

So maybe it isn't so crazy? Maybe they're getting the band back together to terrorize the league again. [Or maybe I'm crazy..](https://imgur.com/38xOoJr)"	nba

IMO this trade makes sense for both teams as the Hornets refuse to trade Kemba, as they still think they can contend with him and should add any contending pieces such as Lou.

520	The Raptors Weren't the First NBA Team in Canada	"The inaugural season of the BAA featured among its 11 teams the Toronto Huskies. The Huskies finished 22-38, which was tied with the Boston Celtics(!) for the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Center Ed Sadowski put up 19.1 ppg, and somehow, no one on the team averaged more than 1.4 assists a game. One player averaged 40% from the field, the next best was 34.9% by Sadowski. The Huskies were one of 4 teams to fold the next season, 2 years before the BAA and the NBL merged to form the NBA as we know it. NBA basketball would not return to Canada till 1995, when the Raptors and Grizzlies were formed as expansion teams.

P.S. I included NBA Team in the title, since the NBA recognizes BAA history as its own history, and its official first season of 1946-47 matches the first BAA season."	nba

What do you think?  The game clock isn't that accurate during the final minute anyways when it comes to the tenths.  If its .1 to .9 left on the clock go up to a full second.  Enough time to catch take a dribble and shoot.  Way more exciting."	nba

525	Rainbow 6: Siege NBA Player Comparisons	"Rainbow Six: Siege is a 5v5 competitive game where there are attackers and defenders. Each player selects their operator which has a unique ability. Basketball is pretty similar to this game, and here are some of my comparisons between operators in the game and NBA players.

**Ash**: Overall the best operator in the game. Very versatile and has very good scoring/fragging potential. **LeBron James** is similar to Ash in that he is the best player in the NBA, is very versatile, and probably the best killer in the league.

**Caviera**: Special ability is that she can be very quiet. Very good for flanking. **Kevin Durant** is similar to Caviera because he can very quietly put up 35 points, and is very good at timing weak side blocks when the slasher doesn't expect him.

**Dokkaebi**: Calls defenders phones. **D'Angelo Russell** is also known for using a phone.

**Jackal**: Is known for tracking footsteps of defenders. **Steph Curry** is also known to have a foot fetish.

**Buck**: Great for vertical gameplay. Can open up floors and ceilings, and is the most versatile operator in the game. **Jimmy Butler** is also one of the most versatile player in the NBA, able to guard multiple positions, and like Buck, is able to score/frag at will.

**Sledge**: Basically a slightly worse Buck. **Paul George** is also a versatile player, like Sledge, but lacks the overall fragging potential of Buck.

**Tachanka**: The meme operator. His gadget is a turret that he places down, and when he does he becomes immobile. Sounds like it should work, but in a game based around being mobile, it doesn't work. Like Tachanka, **Boban Marjonovic**sounds like he should be a great player. He's 7'4"" for crying out loud. But when it comes time for him to run up and down the floor, you see why he is just a meme.

**Valkyrie**: The best intel operator in the game. Can place down cameras that are used to locate the enemies. **Chris Paul** is known for being a very smart player, and almost acts as a coach in the game, similar to Valkyrie.

**Blitz**: When in the right hands, Blitz can be the most annoying operator to deal with. Similar to **JR Smith,** who, when hot can be impossible to deal with.

**Ying**: Flashes her enemies, and takes care of them when they are unable to fight back. **Draymond Green** also likes to incapacitate his opponents, he just does it by kicking them in the junk, and then takes care of them on the court. Ying is also a very versatile operator, and is best on a coordinated team, where she is playing her role.

**IQ**: Has a big booty. **James Harden** also has a big booty.

**Doc**: Can never go wrong with having a Doc on your team, very simple goal as Doc, is to keep your teammates alive longer by healing them up when they need it. **Rajon Rondo** is also a great player to have on your team, who's main objective is to assist other players.

**Smoke**: Known for deploying his ""Toxic babes"", which fill up entire rooms with smoke. **Michael Beasley** is also known for filling up entire rooms with smoke. To give credit to Beasley, he is a very good scorer, just like smoke is very good at killing enemies with his SMG-11, and has an all around solid load out.

**Ela**: Was once an unstoppable killing machine, but her glory days were cut short when she was endlessly nerfed, and is now almost never used. **Derrick Rose** was also once one of the best players in the league, but had endless injuries, which render him nearly ineffective today.

**Mute**: Able to prevent other players from using gadgets which require electricity such as drones. **Kawhi Leonard** is known for not wanting to talk to media members on electronic devices such as microphones.

**Kapkan**: Was once very fat and slow, and almost unusable, but has since been reworked so that he is faster and his gadget is better. **Kyle Lowry** was also formerly fat, but reworked himself and is a good player with some utility.

**Frost**: Used to have a shotgun that could down people from ridiculous range. That shotgun now is has very limited range. **Markelle Fultz** is like Frost because he used to be able to shoot, and he seemingly forgot how to overnight.

**Capitao**: Has an eyepatch, and shoots fire arrows, as well as being very fast. **Rip Hamilton** also wore a mask and could heat up in a hurry

**Hibana**: Shoots pellets which explode reinforced walls. Very fast with great weapons and a good gadget, makes her one of the best operators in the game. **Russell Westbrook** is also known for being fast and explosive, and is one of the best players in the league (Yes, r/NBA) just like Hibana."	nba

Utah Jazz vs Dallas Mavericks, Game 5 of the 2001 NBA playoffs. 17 years ago. I love seeing these rarified combos play against each other. New generation eventually toppling the old. Watching Steve Nash guard John Stockton, you can tell he has a respect for his game as the pass-first PG, likely even patterned himself after his game.

I've tried to compare their defensive ratings before, and am usually met with "" IT DOESN'T WORK FOR GUARDS"" in defense of Jordan's lower DRTG numbers at their respective defensive peaks. Usually, this is in reference to the fact that guards have fewer Defensive Rebound numbers than forwards, which is fair. In the case of Jordan though, he was actually a very solid defensive rebounder, and had virtually identical numbers to Pippen.

So why am i committing a felony by comparing their DRTG then?"	nba

549	[OC] NBA Players are the Highest Earning Young People in America	"Bloomberg released an article today stating that only 45 Americans under 26 years old filed taxes in 2016 with gross income of $10 million or greater.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-05/young-and-rich-45-americans-under-age-26-earned-10-mln-or-more?srnd=premium

Of these 45 Americans, we can deduce that quite a few consist of NBA players.  For multiple reasons, there is not a perfect way to know exactly how many players had over $10 million in gross taxable income in 2016 - taxable income does not equal income earned, there are parts of two NBA seasons in 2016, agents take a cut of salaries, NBA players also have substantial income from endorsements, etc.  

However, if we use 2016-2017 NBA salaries as a proxy for 2016 taxable income for NBA players (salaries in 2016-2017 were higher than the previous year, but since we are excluding endorsement money, I think it's fair to use the higher salary number), we can see that the following players who are American citizens under 26 years old broke the $10 million threshold that year:

Bradley Beal
Anthony Davis
Allen Crabbe
Kawhi Leonard
Kyrie Irving
Tobias Harris
John Wall
Khris Middleton
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
Brandon Knight
John Henson
Jordan Clarkson
Solomon Hill
Derrick Favors
Austin Rivers
Alec Burks
Terrence Ross

TLDR: using this methodology, which is only an approximation of actual taxable earnings and is more of a back of the napkin calculation than an exhaustive study, 17 out of the 45 (or 38%) of the highest earning Americans under 26 in 2016 were NBA players."	nba

551	I just watched the WNBA for the first time and I’ve gotta say	"I just watched the WNBA for the first time and I’ve gotta say IM A FAN!
These girls are legit, and the game is a lot more exciting than I was originally expecting. It seems that the general consensus has been that the WNBA was boring and slow, and lacked the athleticism and exciting plays the NBA has to offer. After watching my first game I couldn’t disagree more. 
After seeing all the news circulating about WNBA players complaining about low compensation, I decided to give the game a chance. I’m a Seattle native and was aware that the storm were playing the mercury for a winner take all game 5, and decided to tune in.
This game ended up being one of the more exciting games I’ve seen all year, including the NBA and college basketball. Sue bird absolutely took over the 4th quarter and looked unconscious draining three after three from all over the court. The game didn’t lack any excitement, and I’ve gotta say, these women know how to play basketball. Their ball movement and understanding of the game is on par with some of the better teams in the NBA. The only knock I could see was the lack of athleticism (dunks), but that didn’t bother me since the game was such a close match and had clutch performances by players on both teams. 
After today I’ll definitely be tuning in to the WNBA finals to root for my storm. You guys should check one of the games out as well, you might end up liking it a lot. If you end up not enjoying it, than at least now you know. Don’t hate on these women though until you’ve actually given their game a chance."	nba

553	How likely is it for MJ's all-time career scoring average to be surpassed?	"MJ's average of 30.1 PPG for his career (Even higher if he hadn't spent 2 years with the Wizards) seems pretty insurmountable. None of the highest active averages are on a trajectory to add 3+ points to their career averages. Rookies don't usually come into the NBA with as much experience and leeway to operate as MJ did. I suppose if someone were to come into the NBA with an almost inconceivable level of talent, it'd be possible, but that seems somewhat likely.

561	How does Michael Jordan feel about Nike's endorsement of Kaepernick?	"Most people here are familiar with Jordan's infamous ""Republicans buy sneakers too"" excuse for not commenting or getting involved in social issues to the degree that some might hope. 

In 2016, Jordan seemed to pivot from this stance a bit when he wrote a piece for the ESPN's ""The Undefeated"" titled 'I Can No Longer Stay Silent.' In it, he wrote, ""As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers."" 

However, I have always viewed Jordan as this sort of ""anything for the bottom-line"" businessman. I think it's what's made him so successful off the court. He is as ruthless in the business world as he ever was as a player. 

Nike's decision to endorse Kaepernick and make him the centerpiece of their new ad campaign is being both celebrated and berated by many. In the end, it may pay off but there is still certainly risk involved whenever a company of that size makes what is viewed as a polarizing decision. It is a decision that could potentially affect the Jordan brand itself as it falls under the Nike umbrella. Obviously, the market for Jordans is most likely largely in favor of Nike's decision. Still, I personally find it hard to imagine that Jordan would have signed off on this if he were given a vote. It may also be likely that he agrees with it on a personal level but does not think it is sound business decision.

The Bulls had dropped the first 2 games of the series and needed a win to stay in the series. With the score tied at 102, and 1.8 seconds left in the game, Phil Jackson drew up a play for rookie Toni Kukoc. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kukoc did manage to drain a [23 foot buzzer beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NSpgbPcxoU) to stun the Knicks, though there wasn't much celebrating by the Bulls players. Cameras even caught a frowning Jackson storming off the court.

Now normally, a team like this would dominate. However, the caveat is that they are not allowed to use their hands in the game. Soccer players tend to use their head a lot, so they would have to somehow try and score by heading the ball into the basket. Dribbling raises some issues here.

Now, on the other hand, we have 5 Kyle Singlers in wheelchairs. Here's how the roster looks like:

Kyle Singler

A stacked team as well, to be certain. However, we must keep in mind that they will be restricted to a wheelchair. Not one of those fancy electric doodahs, neither - a good old fashioned, hand-powered wheelie. 

In a match to the death, who would win this epic basketball game? My money's on the Singlers.

Note: i didn't get much sleep last night and this idea came to me in a dream. I guess swaggy P and me are alike in more ways than I thought."	nba

591	Do you think we’ll start seeing more Hispanic-American NBA players soon?	Obviously there’s been a large number of Hispanic immigrants moving to the US in the last few decades, but there’re very few NBA players who’re American/grew up in America but are of Latin American descent. Basketball, from my experience, is somewhat popular with Hispanics, so do you think we’ll see more of them entering the league soon or will it not ever really catch on?	nba

**Introduction**

The current Basketball Hall of Fame is just that, a hall of fame for anyone who has made a great contribution to the game of basketball. This is not only limited to play on the court in the NBA, but also play in college and internationally, coaching and management at all levels, and media personalities.

This exercise is so that [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) may have its own hall of fame based only on playing accomplishments in the NBA (and ABA in some cases). The goal of this is to have a much more exclusive club of NBA greats. The Basketball Hall of Fame has inductees every year, but the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) hall of fame will have inductees every week this offseason.

**How will it work?**

The first class will be composed of players who retired in 1960 or earlier. The second class will be composed of players who retired 1965 and earlier. The third class will be composed of players who retired 1970 and earlier, and so on.

The players listed must have higher than 20% hall of fame probability according to basketball-reference (just so that the ballots don't become too cluttered).

Each voter will get to choose between 1-5 players who they believe should make the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Any player who gets 50% or more of the vote will be inducted into the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Players who receive between 10% and 49.9% of the vote will be eligible in the next class.

Players who receive less than 10% of the vote will move down to the secondary ballot.

The same process is repeated for the secondary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the primary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will move down to the tertiary ballot.

The same process is again repeated for the tertiary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the secondary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will be ineligible for all future ballots. Also, players who receive 75% or more will skip the secondary and move straight to the primary ballot. New blood will be brought to this ballot from players who have more than 2% but less than 20% hall of fame probability.

Every other day the ballot will be posted as well as the results from the previous two days.

At the end of each week the inductees, their percentage of the votes, and whether they were first ballot, second ballot, etc will be posted as well as the ballot for the next class."	nba
596	[Indiana Pacers] OFFICIAL: We have signed Head Coach Nate McMillan to a multi-year contract extension.		nba
597	Karl Malone is 2nd on the all-time scoring list but never won the scoring title	"He finished runner-up 4 times, each time to Michael Jordan. He scored 31 ppg in 1989-1990, which would have won the scoring title most other years, but was eclipsed by MJ's 33 ppg. MJ has 10 scoring titles but is nonetheless over 4,000 points behind Karl Malone on the all-time list. This is because the Mailman played more seasons than MJ and was still putting up 20 ppg at age 39.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is #1 on the list, only won the scoring title twice, LeBron (#7) has only won it once, and Dirk (#6) has also never won it. Just goes to show that the all-time scoring list rewards consistency and longevity rather than peaks."	nba

This puts into perspective just how much of a skeleton 7'1"" 215 lbs is. Even after putting on 18 lbs he is still very thin.

##Interesting Trends

 - Overall 32 MVPS from West, 31 from East	

 - 2014-2018	5 years straight where MVP was from the West

 - 2009-2013	5 years straight where MVP was from the East

 - 2002-2008	7 years straight where MVP was from the West

 - 1960-1970	11 years straight where MVP was from East

 - 1978 Artis Gilmore won Eastern Conference MVP despite being just tied for 8th in actual MVP voting. The 7 vote-getters ahead of Gilmore were Walton (winner), Gervin, Thompson, KAJ, Davis, Lucas, Westphal. No other Conference MVP winner placed worse than 5th overall (and only 2 were 5th- 2007 LeBron James and 1969 Elgin Baylor)

##Dominance

 - 2006-2018	11 of 13 for **LBJ** in the East (7 straight from 2012-2018)	

 - 2010-2014	4 of 5 for **KD** in the West	

 - 1987-1998	9 of 12 for **MJ** in the East (9 out of 10 if you don't include time he was retired)	

 - 1983-1991	9 straight for **Magic** in the West	

 - 1971-1981	8 of 11 for **KAJ** in the West	

 - 1958-1965	6 of 8 for **Russell** in the East	

 - 1956-1961	5 of 6 for **Pettit** in the West	

##Versatility: Players that Won a Conference MVP with Multiple Teams	

 - ^* Shaq	ORL (1995), LAL (2000), 2005 (MIA)

 - LBJ	CLE (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010), MIA (2012-2014), CLE (2015-2018)

 - ^* Moses Malone	HOU (1979, 1982), PHI (1983)

 - KAJ	MIL (1971-1974), LAL (1976, 1977, 1980, 1981)

 - ^* KG 	MIN (2004), BOS (2008)

^* Wilt, Moses Malone, Shaq, and KG are the only ones to win it in each conference (Wilt did it with Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors)

##Longevity: Players with 8+ years between first and last Conference MVPs

 - 9 seasons Wilt (1960-1968)

 - 11 seasons Shaq (1995-2005)

 - 11 seasons KAJ (1970-1981)

 - 12 seasons MJ (1987-1998)

 - 13 seasons LBJ (2006-2018)

*It's interesting that when people talk about their top 5/10 lists, they mention KAJ's longevity, and Shaq's peak, when they both went 11 years between their first and last Conference MVP (though Shaq's three Conference MVPs pale in comparison to KAJ's eight).*

###The Greats: 3+ Conference MVPs

 - 11 LBJ (East)

 - 9 MJ (East)

 - 9 Magic (West)

 - 8 KAJ (West)

 - 6 Russell (East)

 - 5 Wilt (1 West, 4 East)

 - 5 Pettit (West)

 - 4 KD (West)

 - 4 Bird (East)

  - 3 Baylor (West), Kobe (West), Duncan (West), West (West), McAdoo (East), Karl Malone, Moses Malone (2 in West, 1 in East), Shaq (1 in West, 2 in East)

 - Thought it was worth mentioning since he's an all-time great, and the most notable person missing from this list, Hakeem Olajuwon, only has 1 Conference MVP (his historic MVP year in 1994), all other consensus all time top 10 players have at least 3.

###Unlucky: Players that Won a Conference MVP but Never Won an Actual MVP

 - 2004	Jermaine O'Neal (3rd)	

 - 2003	Tracy McGrady (4th)	

 - 2002	Jason Kidd (2nd)	

 - 1999+2000	Alonzo Mourning (2nd+3rd)	

 - 1994	Scottie Pippen (3rd)	

 - 1992	Clyde Drexler (2nd)	

 - 1979	Elvin Hayes (3rd)	

 - 1978	Artis Gilmore (T-8th)	

 - 1975	Rick Barry (4th)	

 - 1972	John Havlicek (4th)	

 - 1971	Dave Bing (3rd)	

 - 1965+1966+1970	Jerry West (3rd+2nd+2nd)	

 - 1962+1963+1969	Elgin Baylor (4th+2nd+5th)	

 - 1968	Lenny Wilkens (5th)	

 - 1967	Nate Thurmond (2nd)	


 


**Note: Also I know this is pretty arbitrary, and kind of screws players who played in the same conference as the best player at the time (KAJ, Magic, Jordan, LBJ, etc.), I just thought it was interesting.

^**Final ^Note: ^The ^way ^I ^did ^it ^makes ^a ^lot ^of ^assumptions, ^and ^supposedly ^it ^is ^possible ^that ^even ^if ^every ^voter ^voted ^the ^same ^way ^on ^each ^ballot ^that ^we'd ^get ^different ^results, ^but ^this ^is ^just ^for ^fun ^and ^ultimately ^I ^think ^it's ^fine ^to ^make ^the ^assumptions ^I ^did.

622	Luol vs Melo: Who do you think will have a better upcoming season?	"Luol played a grand total of 13 minutes last season, but looked pretty decent in the NBA Africa game, albeit a little heavy. He put up 14 pts and 3 boards as well as 3 steals. The season before this with the Lakers, he  played 26 minutes/gm and gave you 7p/5r/1a.

Melo played the entire last season with OKC, had some really good moments, but seemed to get torched (and be a bit of a scapegoat) near the end of the season. He put up 16p/6r/1a in 32 minutes. 

It seems obvious that Melo is going to do better, especially if you believe CP3 + Harden will do a better job getting Melo what he wants. However, could Luol be effective on a team, esp like the Timberwolves, where he automatically has a level of comfort playing with people he's played with before?

623	Ben Simmons &amp; The 76ers: A Threat to a Dynasty	"Taken and reformatted from original post [here](https://theunderhand.com/ben-simmons-threat-dynasty/)

If there's one thing that NBA fans worldwide can (hopefully) agree upon, it's that Ben Simmons' first season in the league was nothing short of fantastic.

After being selected first overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, and further missing that full season due to injury, Simmons debuted this season and dominated, averaging 15.8ppg, 8.1rpg, and 8.2apg. Take into account that he did all this without any semblance of a jumpshot within his game and it continues to impress. Regardless of whether Simmons was a ‘true’ rookie in the season past, he seems destined for a bright future in the NBA.

Simmons was the key playmaker on the young Philadelphia 76ers squad, where he led them to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, finishing with a 52-30 record. This was also their first playoffs appearance in the last 6 years – not bad for a rookie. He excelled running the team’s offense, racking up dimes across the season for a total of 661 – good for 3rd place in the entire NBA. He was comfortable in his game all-around, getting his boards and points to respectable tallies. For a long while, it seemed as though ‘The Process’ was complete.


**Exposure in the Playoffs**

Simmons and the 76ers were, however, exposed in the semi-finals of the playoffs by their newfound Eastern Conference rival – the Boston Celtics. They did what many teams had tried to do all year, and found a way to semi-stifle Ben Simmons’ offensive game with what is possibly the simplest tactic of all time. They gave him space. And when I say they gave him space, I mean they gave him SPACE, which inevitably led to THIS.

I can’t remember a time when any NBA team disrespected a player on defence in such a way since the[ Spurs played Hack-a-Shaq 5 seconds into the 2008 season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_soY5Jg_Q). Even then, that was a joke by Popovich.

[As you can see in ESPN's stats](https://imgur.com/a/TqrBt5h), during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Simmons was held to only 1 point. It's nothing to be entirely worried about, although it's definitely worth noting. This was his first season in the league, and his first true exposure to high-stakes competition, something he didn't reach at LSU. To expect a rookie to have to carry teams with 30+ point performances night-in-night-out shows how much we, as viewers, have become acclimatised to the ability of the likes of LeBron James.

[In this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/97g7ae/oc_worst_playoff_performances_by_notable_rookies/), it's evident that many notable rookies experience similar struggles at some point. Even the Celtics' Tatum had a 4pt game this year; see also, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony circa. 2004.

[Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJdHh9a1Ok) at how Simmons scored his 16 points, though, in Game 3 - immediately following his 1pt performance:

* A mismatch in the post, where he's now 1-on-1 against Rozier (an 8 inch advantage). He goes around him and finishes.
* Goes around Morris who is slow off reading a screen and finishes with a right-hand layup just in front of Horford.
* Finishes around Ojeleye in transition.
* Comes around a screen from Embiid and fakes out Baynes, finishing with an awkward floater/layup on his right.
* Lob on transition from Reddick.
* Hits an exceptionally awkward looking left-handed fadeaway over Horford in the paint.
* Hesitates and pull-ups for a fade in the paint.
* Spins around his defender for a layup.

It's worth noting that Boston didn't give him quite as much space as in Game 2. Compare that to [THIS play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=58&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU) during Game 2.

Horford immediately drops deep and allows Simmons space. Yes, he does get the pass off to Saric who drains the shot - but the principle is right. In fact, if you keep watching the video, you'll see just how effective Boston's tactics were; cutting passing lanes, allowing Simmons space, spying on movement, and doubling down low.

This isn’t to say that it’s a make or break situation for Philly; Ben Simmons, regardless of whether he’s given space or not has shown that he is capable of getting to the rim and finishing – particularly from broken play. He also has phenomenal court vision, and an ability to find any open man as soon as they lace up and step on the court. You see, it's not that Ben Simmons is able to be completely nullified and will never score points again; **it's that Boston managed to find a way that neutralises many of his half-court threats, and this impacts heavily on the structure and flow of the 76ers' offense.**

**The Boston Defence**

Stopping Simmons using the style of defence applied by the Celtics also requires a very versatile, switchable defensive scheme, and an effective set of players – something that few teams in the league have at their disposal. [Boston defends in a very similar manner to Golden State](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/15/boston-celtics-switching-defense-pays-dividends-2018-playoffs) – a heavy usage of switching. When you look at the Celtics squad, they have a group of interchangeable wings that can easily switch assignment without having to face too much of a deficit, plus the access of a premier defender in Marcus Smart. Al Horford is also crucial in this regard, as his pure ability to read the defense and play smart basketball is what gives the Celtics an edge. To top it all off, you have by far one of the best coaches in the league in Brad Stevens, who reads the game unlike many others. Stevens actually said that [he runs a more ‘position-less’ squad](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720250-brad-stevens-says-celtics-have-3-not-5-positions-now), which is what helps the effectiveness of this system. With the use of ‘ball-handlers’, ‘wings’, and ‘bigs’, there is room for interchange.

Here's a look at how the Celtics could line-up this coming season.

First Unit:
* Ball Handler - Kyrie Irving

* Wing - Jaylen Brown

* Wing - Jayson Tatum

* Wing - Gordon Hayward

* Big - Al Horford

Bench unit:
* Ball Handler - Terry Rozier

* Wing - Marcus Smart

* Wing - Semi Ojeleye

* Wing - Marcus Morris

* Big - Aron Baynes

That's a REALLY versatile defensive lineup.

What I would expect to see from other less-capable defensive teams is the key lessons more so than the specific scheme – give him space, cut passing lanes, and limit transition opportunities. Now evidently Simmons' teammates will still have a good chance of hitting their shots; they're professional basketballers playing in the best league in the world. But, this strategy is about limiting their effectiveness, Simmons' distribution, and disrupting the offense.

Something to really consider is that[ Simmons averaged the second-most offensive touches during the 2017-18 regular season](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612755), losing to only Russell Westbrook. Simmons’ 95.0 touches per game increase to 104.6 touches during the 76ers playoff run, almost 6 more touches than LeBron per game, and more than Westbrook.

When you take into account such a high volume of touches, it’s clear that he truly is the core facilitator in the Philadelphia squad – the next highest was Embiid at 76.4 (76.6 in the playoffs). This is also the core of the issue. If your main facilitator is unable to play his normal style of game, get passes to the right place, get his shots off, and the opposition is able to spy on offensive movement, your team won’t run as well as it should. Simmons is essentially unable to adapt his game to the Boston defense, due to the fact that he can’t generate any respect as a shooting threat.

**Simmons and Shooting**

Similarly, Simmons cannot be relied upon to drain high-percentage looks down the stretch. Even if Simmons were to remain on the court during clutch situations, and acted as the primary ball-handler, his odds of getting a successful go-ahead bucket are limited. Switch this idea, having Simmons on the court but not handling the ball, and you simply have one less player that the defense has to worry about on a catch-and-shoot situation, meaning that they are able to better focus their defensive energies to threats.

[Look again at this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=255&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU). Late in the fourth-quarter, Simmons really can't do much to help the team in this situation as the main playmaker. Embiid ends up pulling up from three, and Saric gets the second-chance points.

Yes, you could play Simmons down on the low-block in these situations as a lob threat and crashing the offensive glass – but that’s a bit insulting to your players with the league-high touches per game, no? Regardless, Simmons' low-post game is nowhere near developed enough to be a respectable threat - unless it's a mismatch (see the Rozier mismatch above), and his off-ball movement is generally above Westbrook-level, but not enough to create a huge threat.

Another potential threat to the Sixers is the prospect of Hack-a-Simmons. During the regular season, he shot **56% on 4.2 attempts/game**. Although this increased to 70% during the playoffs on a much smaller sample size, the question remains: Do you risk keeping on your main offensive threat in these late-game situations, when:

* He’s a risk of being sent to the line?
* He’s clearly struggling to generate points in a half-court offense?
* You’re facing a team with a good interior defender, and a switch-heavy defense, allowing him space and negating part of the offensive flow?

Let’s take a theoretical situation where Philly decides to take Simmons OUT of the lineup during the final three minutes of a playoff game. You’re now missing the remainder of Simmons’ 104 touches, and they have to be moved somewhere. Therefore, one of your other players has to step in and run the offense. The natural solution is either:

1. The reserve PG (T.J. McConnell) steps in and runs it as per previously
2. ISO every play with your most efficient scorer (Embiid - 0.82pts per ISO possession, on 1.6 possessions per game).

The first option is much less intimidating to the defensive team; no disrespect to T.J. McConnell (for whom I have a huge soft spot), but his playmaking is below-par in comparison to Simmons. The second option, as scary as it may seem, is not justifiable for long-stretches of game time. Embiid is a great scorer, but against a good defensive centre, not only is he going to get tired, but defenders will adapt.

Simply said, Ben Simmons NEEDS to develop some form of a shooting stroke. At the very minimum, a respectable FT percentage to allow him to stay on the court during late-game situations. If he doesn’t do so, then the 76ers need an adequate replacement.

**Wrong Hand Woes**

On the topic of Simmons’ shooting, Kevin O’Connor (Writer for The Ringer - shoutout u/KevinOConnorNBA love your work and hope you enjoy this), is ADAMANT that he uses the wrong hand for shooting.

In a recent interview with Fox Sports, Simmons was asked about whether even he knows which hand of his is more dominant, to which he replied, “You come to the gym. I’m gonna work out when I’m in Melbourne. You’ll see.” As cryptic as that may be, he continued when prodded to say, “In the NBA you’ve gotta play to what your strengths are. I never had real chances of just shooting. I never played in a year where I had to develop my shooting, because I was always better than most of the guys I played. Even this season without the jumper I was able to nearly have a triple-double every game.”

On the topic of whether developing shooting will be something he looks into in the near future, he said, “It just depends where I wanna be later in life. I can be satisfied with 15/8/8, or if I wanna be at that next level and be an all-star, then I add something to my game.”

[Here's Simmons hitting a nice-looking right-hand hook shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUN4rYSekYg)

In comparison, [here's a shot Simmons took left-handed during a pre-season workout.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&amp;v=ihyFtqYng5s)

See the difference? Nobody knows for sure, but it's something Simmons himself needs to establish.

**The Impact of Respect**

To wrap this all up, let’s take a look at what the Boston defence may look like should Simmons develop some form of shooting stroke.

If Ben Simmons would even attempt proper three-pointers during games, you may find that the space between himself and a defender like Horford may slowly shrink. Hell, even Marcus Smart, arguably one of the worst decent-volume shooters in the league, is taking open threes, shooting at a measly 29.3% career clip - at 4.2 attempts per game.

Below are some edited glimpses into how the defense could look if Simmons' developed any resemblance to a perimeter threat - taken from the original image above.

https://imgur.com/a/m4MXcbx
3pt% = 15-20

https://imgur.com/a/ETAkBoG
3pt% = 25

https://imgur.com/a/9AUT2VJ
3pt% = 30

This seemingly insignificant increase in space, caused by the increased respect for Simmons' genuine threat of a half-decent jumpshot changes the entire dynamic of the defense that the 76ers will face.

**Conclusion**

To reiterate, the downside is that the teams capable of providing such a defensive impact are few and far between in the current NBA, as it requires such a diverse lineup and widespread talent, plus solid coaching. During the regular season, there is also MUCH less time for these teams to focus on implementing defensive game-plans simply for one team; it’s during the coming playoffs that we’ll largely see whether franchises choose to adapt to such a style, and if so, then personally I find it hard to see Philly going too much further than this season without a solid replacement and/or third-scoring option (looking at you Fultz).

Regardless, I believe that this coming season we’ll see Ben Simmons still have a great follow-up to his rookie year – at least statistically. He’s evidently one of the most talented offensive players that the league has seen, with an unreal feel and read of the game. Will the Sixers manage to make it through a balanced eastern conference this year, with a strong Celtics squad and defensively-improved Raptors, amongst others? That remains to be seen."	nba

The Clippers had the young star Blake Griffin and of course had completed a trade prior to the season to get Chris Paul. Both teams records were within one game of each other. There were a lot of great moments in the series. Rudy Gay’s missed game winner in game 3 at the buzzer. The historic 20 point come back by the Clippers in game 4 to put them ahead 3-1 was fantastic. Then the subsequent two games where the Grizzlies were able to force a game 7 with overall great play from Gasol and Randolph. The series ended with the Clippers taking it after beating the Grizzlies on the road. This was just a really fun series to follow for me and cemented my liking of the NBA.

This non biased stat represents a couple of things.

It also illustrates an ability to play well defensively by reading passing lanes, intercepting well and being strong one on one or with weak side defence. 1.7% was the limit as poor defenders Mike Conley (1.6) and Clint Capela (1.4) could have snuck in otherwise.  
  
Finally an assist percentage was used to demonstrate that this player is unselfish and a strong playmaker. Someone you would want to have on your team. I decided on 22% as the limit as you wouldn’t value selfish ball hogs like Victor Oladipo (21.2%) and Jimmy Butler (20.6%)

679	Analysis of the Economic Impact of Constructing a NBA Arena on the Host City	"https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2014&amp;q=nba+statistical+analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2938&amp;context=cmc_theses

Here’s an interesting study I found regarding the implementation of basketball arenas and the effect it has on the local economy.

**Abstract**
&gt;Using economic data collected from 24 different Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US, this thesis investigates the impact of constructing a new National Basketball Association (NBA) arena on the host city’s economy. When a simplistic model is implemented, which does not control for other economic factors or individual subject heterogeneity, significantly positive economic impacts of arena construction are observed. However, when a more appropriate model specification is implemented that controls for economic activity and individual heterogeneity, these effects are no longer statistically significant. This comparative analysis ultimately highlights the importance of appropriate model specification and supports the conclusion that new NBA arenas, by themselves, **are not significant catalysts of urban economic development.**"	nba

683	Can a All-WNBA team beat the worst team in the D-league? Is there a gender pay gap?	"Recent dicussions of a ""gender pay gap"" has gotten me thinking of what's fair and not fair in terms of salary.

I have no problem with the WNBA and feel that there is a place in the world for it but do not agree that WNBA players are underpaid. 

Back to my original question, I don't believe that a team assembled with the best wnba players would be able to beat the worst D league team. 

According to a google search the average WNBA salary is around $70,000 and the average D-league salary is around $35,000.

If the wnba players aren't as good as an average D-league player, is it fair that they make more than D-league players?

689	Here's why the Orlando Magic are the true heirs to the Eastern Conference throne	"Everyone remembers how good the Magic were for the first 12 games of the 17-18 season, going 8-4 with absurdly incomprehensible statistics that seemed to defy the laws of nature itself. They didn't go, uh, as well for the rest of the season, but it is clear to see that this hugely disrespected team is more than its final record would suggest. Here's why the Orlando Magic are the real successors to LeBron's dynasty:

\-Losing Shelvin ""Dishing Dimes"" Mack and his 3.9 assists per game isn't ideal, but the true solution can be found in Point Gordon. This could be the season where Air Gordon becomes the Magic's true playmaker, and if you watch his highlights ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s)), he has the vision to make it work. If only he had the foresight to see that using a drone in a dunk contest isn't as good as jumping over a KIA ™ automobile.

\-Mo ""Long Boi"" Bamba is not only a solid shooter and shotblocker, but he had a rap song named after him BEFORE he even made it to the NBA! Plus Sheck Wes was really catchy on No Bystanders and his adlibs are pure heat, so I'll give Mo props by default.

\-They traded for Timofey ""Solid contributor to a title-winning team"" Mozgov. Yes, THE Mosgov that exploded for the best NBA game in history ([https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg)) with a whopping 93 points and 29 rebounds. If you can find a more dominant big man, then you're probably watching old Wilt tapes.

With solid contributors like Nikola ""He's an All-Star if teams were selected after 4 games"" Vucevic and Evan ""Don't Google his last name"" Fournier, as well as Jonathan ""KD if his elite scoring was actually elite defence"" Isaac, these players aren't to be underestimated.

692	Skylar Diggins Vs Harrison Barnes (WNBA vs NBA wage gap thoughts)	"So this was planned to made into a youtube video but I figured I'd post it here to stir the pot as well. This post is in regards to Skylar digginss comments made earlier this week.


 1) What is the wage gap? The wage gap is the difference between male and female earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings, according to the OECD. Basically its the idea that women are oppressed and make less money than their male counterparts for the same job/work."" ""It's the belief that just because of the gender you identify/born into, will make less money in a unfair way. Now why am I bringing this up? 
	: ""If you follow sports even a smidget, then you've probably heard the recent noise in regards to ""wage gap"" between WNBA players and NBA players. The most recent woman to make a stir (depending on when you see this video) was Skylar Diggins. 

2) Skylar Kierra Diggins-Smith (born August 2, 1990) She is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Wings of the WNBA. She was drafted 3rd overall by the Tulsa Shock in the 2013 WNBA draft. In high school, she was the National Gatorade Player of the Year, the Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, and a McDonald's All-American. Diggins played point guard for Notre Dame, where she led Notre Dame to three consecutive Final Fours and two consecutive NCAA championship appearances. She finished her Notre Dame career ranked first in points and steals, second in assists, and as a two-time winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top point guard in the nation ""and yes this is a copy and paste from wiki-pedia lol"" 
	""The point is...... This woman is not ignorant when it comes to basketball. She has the experience, tenure, and skills to back herself up as one of the great WNBA players. She's won many accolades and stands out among her peers, buuuuuuut why are we talking about her? Well, while her skills didnt make headline news..... her mouth did. She, like others before her, made a statement by calling out the wage-gap in sports specifically WNBA vs NBA. She even fired shots at a current NBA players (WHO PLAYS IN THE SAME CITY!!!!),  Harrison Barnes. Unfortunately we live in 2018 and, understandably, while she may only have meant to use Barnes as a example, she was eaten alive by the internet. Fortunately for you I decided to do just a small amount of research and look into the comments she made as well as the accuracy of her comments. and  I also took a look at recent NBA/WNBA seasons for stats in regards to why this ""wage-gap"" might exist but we'll get to those later. Firstly I'd like to just bring up some of the comments she has reportedly made as well as links to those webpages, they'll be down in the description""

3)Quotes: *Before we start, I just want to point out that these are quotes I picked for the sake of this video. I wanted to be able to represent the argument as much as I could using both positive and negative quotes to give you a better idea of what was said and why. There may have been other qutoes that have made headline news that I just missed and I'll go ahead and apologize for it. That being said, lets begin. 
 
	
So this first quote has to be the most popular.....
	:) ""Players in the NBA get about 50% of the revenue. For women, the percentage is in the twenties. So before we even talk about base salary or anything like that, we don’t even get paid the same percentage of the revenue that we bring in, which is kind of unbelievable. People try to hijack this issue and say that women’s basketball may not be as interesting a game, because they disparage women in sports, period. But we don’t even make the same percentage of revenue! And jersey sales…we don’t get any of it. The men do. And I have had a top-five jersey for three or four years in the WNBA.""

Response: This is about as neutral of the quotes as it gets. She outlines real issues that need discussion and research. The lack of revenue from jersey sales is what I agree with the most however that's an issue you need to take up with your league but also keep in mind...... you dont sell many jerseys as it is. In regards to disparaging women sports, in this case basketball, thats just false. WNBA struggles with rating and viewership sure but NCAA womens basketball has a high viewership and the championship game received 3.8 million viewers. While you cant chalk that up as attendance I dont think you can make the claim we disparage women in sports. The truth of the matter is the WNBA markets itself horribly. She claims we dont like women sports or dont want them but do you think people know who serena williams is? Ronda Rousey? Danica Patrick? We have female sport headlines, just not in your field of expertise. Overall I see this as the prime quote because it outlines where she was right but also the sense of entitlement that I'll touch on later. 


	:) ""Only the top 1% of all women who play the game make it to [the WNBA], ""But what am I supposed to tell my daughter? This lack of gender parity and the wage gap will be there, whatever she wants to do. She will never make the same amount of money as a man. She will never make the same amount of money as my son will.""

Response: Sooooo the top 1%? Thats the same for men so no dice there. She then trails off trying to tie in the regular gender wage gap and her argument. I dont have time to discuss the full Wage-gap argument but heres the summary.... There is no statistical data to definitively prove one side or other. It's a touchy subject that has been intermixed with lies and false facts, like her comment. You're comparing the same fields of work yes, but like you said its a top 1%, hardly close to the average everyday woman complaining of the wage gap. This quote from her highlights the prime issue with wage arguments.... It's not connected together, it's a opinion not fact, and it's supplemented with no information or prime examples. I dont expect her to have them ready to go but just spouting it off in a way thats matter of fact is creates even more chaos and keeps us further from having an actually conversation about it while also pushing many away from her and her message. 

	:) ""I’m the highest paid player on the Dallas Wings, and my salary is in the low six figures. [Harrison Barnes, the highest paid player on the Dallas Mavericks, made $24 million last season.] He’s definitely younger than me. Do you know his stats? Was he an All-Star? I mean, it doesn’t matter. But last year, I was First Team All-WNBA, which only goes to five players. I was also a WNBA All-Star for the third time.""

Response: Sense of entitlement..... Im this great, I do this, I accomplished that. Why should someone I view as inferior to me, accolade wise, make more than me? Did you forget he's a NBA champion? Are you a champion? ""Did you see his stats"" hahaha hunny, I looked up both of yalls stats..... Guess what? He has/had better numbers than you. So technically speaking, yes he should make more than you on the simple fact that his production is greater than yours in the same field right? Think about this..... All of his stats, except for average assists, are better than you yet he didnt make an all NBA team or an All Start team. If we remove gender and play this equal, such is a the basis for your whole issue, then yes.... you should make less than him. 

	:) ""I'm at a loss for words sometimes, talking about this,"" she said. ""It's unfortunate that men make more money for the same amount of work, or even less work.""

Response: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM heres the thing..... Your total season is 34 games, after playoffs it maxs at 43. The NBA almost plays twice as many games as you in the regular season, and depending on game outcomes, the playoffs make it 3x as many played games. How is that equal or less work? They play more games, they travel much more frequently, and their seasons can run up to almost 8-9 months. How is this equal work. You do less work by this logic. So yes more hours should equal more pay.

	:) ""I would be curious to know how successful we could be with such a great product if we had the same platform as the guys do,"" she said. ""Think about the marketing dollars that they spend on guys, the platform given to them. Branding opportunities, TV deals, endorsement deals. It's kind of like the chicken and the egg.""

Response: I dont think I really need to respond to this much. Unfortunately, on average women are less athletically gifted than men. Thats just factual. So yes, if the same amount of money was spent marketing you and growing your buzz, ratings and attendance might increase. But for the casual/simple fan, I dont believe theyd watch a WNBA game over an NBA game even if this all magically happened. The average fan dosnt understand the nuances of the game, by and large they are attracted to the insane feats of athleticism. Im not saying women cant be just as athletic as men, but if we had to put a number on it I'd say 1-10. 

	:) ""As athletes, we have to fight. As women, we have to fight. And we need more people at our table to fight with us,"" she told Wealthsimple. ""There needs to be more women and more people of color hired so we can curate our own sports stories. And we need men speaking out about these things.""

Response: The funniest part of all of this is she says ""we need men speaking out about these things"" well if you keep calling them out and putting them on blast for something they have no control of, why would they help you? Why should they/I fight for you when you've berated and belittled us all so you can point out how youve been neglected?  I just.... I cant, sorry no more quotes, my brain is about to explode......

So we got past the hard part..... now some fun data facts but first let me explain the issues I see with the WNBA

:) ""There’s a case they’re underpaid based on current conditions. There’s an even better case their product would improve if they were treated better. Due to the WNBA’s low wages, many WNBA players play overseas during the offseason. Couple that with long commercial flights, the players get worn down.""
	:) Not alot of marketing done for players/teams/games
	:) Far less income

Okay now stats......

NBA STATS:
	Games: 82+ playoffs
	Total revenue: 2015-2016 (5.9 billion)
	Age: Began in 1946
	Total Attendance: 14 million+ ( http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance )

WNBA STATS:
	Games: Total of 34, 43 with playoffs.
	Total Revenue: 50-65 million
	Age: Began in 1996 (50 years after mens NBA started)
	Total Attendance:  1,574,078 (2017) - 7,716 fans per game. (about the same average as NBA in 1966)
	2017: WNBA averaged 7,716 fans per game, 12 teams, players make between 39,000 - 115,000, split 11million in % revenue with players. (roughly 55 million total made). They only paid players 22.8 % of revenue that year, two years prior they were paid 33%. Link: https://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2017/09/how-the-wnba-is-underpaying-its-players/


Now just for some more reasons, in particular, of why Harrison barnes would still be worth more than you in the same league and same circumstances.

Harrison Barnes: 
	Height: 6'8
	Weight: 225lbs
	Vert: No-step (38 inches, 4rth highest in nba history)
	NBA Champion
	Stats (2018): 18.9 pts, 6.1 reb, 2.0 ast, 44.5 FG% (only averaged 7.0 FG made per game) 35.7% 3pt.

Skylar Diggins:
	Height: 5'9
	Wight: 145 lbs
	Vert: unknown * CANT DUNK
	All-star, All WNBA
	Stats (2018): 17.9 pts, 3.4 reb, 6.2 ast, 40.1 FG% (only averaged 5.9 FG made per game *11.8 PTS) 29.7% 3pt.

Didnt believe me earlier when I said she had worse stats? My man Barnes has almost a full 12 inches of height and could probably get his knee caps above your head when he jumps. Seriously though, if you wanna be truly equal then understand this..... You're as tall as Nate robinson was, half his speed, and put up worse numbers than the man you called out. So if I were to evaluate you for pay off performance, Yes I'd pay Barnes more. Maybe you didnt just mean only him but you tossed his name out and thats your own fault. 

To close, I think you can see where I stand. This was a ignorant person making ignorant comments with no evidence or information to go off. Skylar Diggins has a sense of entitlement that she is owed something. Growing up my parents taught me you arent owed anything. You work and work and even still you might not get what you ""think"" you deserve. Thats life. We can make it better, but not with half-witted conversations comming from people who cant bother to see the real issues. I cant believe this has blown up the way it has, its stupid honestly. Yes we should talk about it, yes we could do better, yes in some aspects it may seem unfair but before we start shouting to the rooftops ""WAGE-GAP!!!!"" lets remember.

Your league has 10 teams, 22 teams smaller than the NBA
Your league plays a max of 43 games, almost half of a REGULAR NBA SEASON
Your league only had about 1/14th the attendance that the NBA had
Your league pulls in 50-65 million of total revenue, the NBA pulled in 5.9 BILLION
Your league started in 1996, NBA started 50 years prior. Oh and fun fact, your league is 21/22 years old. You have a higher average attendance and views than the NBA did at 21/22 years of age. You just have to wait and grow, they did. 

There's no perfect solution to any issue in the world, but we create more issues when we speak out of turn or out our..... you know whats. I dont think she meant it all this drastically to the point the media has blown it up as, maybe she did, but once it's been said you cant take it back. You unintentionally put a person on blast and had the audacity to say that it's not fair on you. Skylar Diggins has a self sense of entitlement that cant be justified with facts or statistical data. All she runs off is opinion, feeling, and word baiting for the masses intentional or not. I dont respect her and I stand by all of the claims in the video. Thank you for watching, please leave a comment and lets have a real discussion. Bye

BUT, there is just one.. slightly annoying issue, and that is anytime my boyfriend and I kiss, hug, or try to do anything ""intimate"" Indy loses his mind barking and jumping on us and wanting attention. 

We've tried crating him, locking him out of the bedroom, but it's like he has dick-telepathy and can tell exactly what's going on, and he will scream and scratch the door or cry and rattle his crate until we give up and take him out. We give him a Kong, toys, anything we can. He never does this when we leave the house. We are just dumbfounded with what to do to get him to calm down when we want some Mommy-Daddy time. 


Does anyone have any advice on getting our puppy to chill the heck out when we want to get our swerve on??

Thanks LOL"	dogs
703	[Fluff] My anxiety has been through the roof lately, and my dog has also been MUCH more cuddly than usual. I think she knows I need the extra love &lt;3	"Without going into too much detail it's been a rough year for me. Undoubtedly the hardest year of my life, and it isn't over yet. I've been super anxious, and these past few weeks in particular have been ROUGH. My dog has always been pretty affectionate, but a lot of times will only snuggle for a few minutes and then she'll get up to lay in her own bed or on the floor. Or she'll move to her own space on the couch. Lately, she's been snuggling up as close as she can possibly get to me and staying by my side all night until I finally get up to go to bed. It really helps with my anxiety. I feel like she must know I need it, because it seems like her level of cuddliness almost direct correlates to my anxiety levels. We never got around to taking the therapy dog certification, but she's a therapy dog for me at the very least &lt;3

706	[HELP] Dog stepped on bee	"My dog stepped on a bee and I can’t find the stinger. His paw is a little swollen but nothing major. Is this something that will clear on its own? It’s been about an hour and he seems fine otherwise. Our vet isn’t open the weekends and I don’t know if it’s worth going to an emergency clinic. Any feedback is welcome! 

I also gave him an anti-inflammatory to help with the swelling.

Edit: This was prescribed to him in the past by the vet. 

Update:
Thanks everyone for your responses! I am breathing a sigh of relief that my dog isn’t allergic to bees. Pretty damn sure we’re both going to be on high alert for walks to make sure we don’t have a repeat of today.

Hah. Who am I kidding? Dogs will be dogs and he’s probably gonna do it again soon just to make sure it was real lmao Like when he eats grass, throws up, and does it again the next day. This little shit.

707	[Discussion] Are poodles Velcro?	"In general, are standard poodles considered to be Velcro dogs (follow from room to room, must join you in bathroom...)? Are they cuddly?

I’m dabbling with the idea of getting a new dog. I don’t need another working dog. I need a dog that is good with other dogs and preferably reserved with strangers. I would like a dog with a big/deep bark. 

I have also considered some of the more typical Velcro dogs but poodles are really starting to appeal to me. 

Poodle people: are some lines are more/less cuddly than others? How can I find a “logical” breeder that isn’t into minimal vaccines or number? 

And finally, Does anyone have experience with asking a breeder for a very cuddly puppy and being happy with the puppy placed with them? (I know there’s no guarantee). I have only ever gone to a breeder with working ethic as a requirement in the puppy so I’m inexperienced when it comes to requesting this type of personality trait

English isn’t my first language so please let me know if there’s anything I need to clarify. Thank you for reading! 

Edit: thank you everyone for the comments! This is great to hear. They might be just what I’m looking for.

709	[Help] Senior dog and fake pregnancy	"Before i start: sorry for my english, it's not my first language

My dog is really old. We don't have the exact age, but i'm sure she is 15+
Recently she stopped being able to jump on my bed without help (and sure doesn't want to learn to use the steps i made). Anyway, things of old age

We never got her spayed and the fake pregnancies kept coming, but were manageable and was never consistent.

Now she is old and she stopped eating. We took her to the vet for tests and she doesn't have anything, heart is really good, but he said only her liver is ""on the limit"". Age related.

She has little tumours on her belly, but the vet said that it's normal tumours for old dogs and she's not likely to have major problems with it. Besides, she is too old to do something invasive.

He gave her a shot to make her eat more, but it works for one or two days and she goes back to rarely eating. She is rail thin right now and became a huge picky eater.

These last two fake pregnancies have been insane. She wines a lot, keeps ventilating, barks, try to dig a hole in the sofa, eats less than she was already eating and just cries and dig all night.

We know there's nothing much to do and we have to just wait, but since it's getting pretty bad every time, the vet suggested anticonceptive pills.

Why not? It's not like she is gonna get worse since she is already not eating anything.

It helped a lot, she stopped her behaviour and started eating again! Now that the pills ended, she just gone back to fake pregnancy and her nasty behaviour.

Pills are not available in my city now, but even if it is, we decided to ride along and wait for it to end and see if the appetite gets back.

The vet said there's nothing much to do, just keep trying to get her to eat. We could do scans to see if there's something worse, but given her age, any kind of invasive procedure will be really bad so he said to just wait.

Anyway, i don't know what i'm asking here. Anybody had similar problems?"	dogs
710	Story time! Dog Park Nightmare [Discussion]	"There have been a lot of posts recently about breaches of dog park etiquette, so I thought I’d share mine.

My apartment building has a dog park attached to it, solely for resident use. Back in March, a resident adopted a 2 year old pit bull/Rottweiler mix (we’ll call her “Daisy”). Daisy had spent the first 2 years of her life as a bait dog for a dog fighting ring. She would be tied up by her ankle, and sacrificed to the fighting dogs to get them riled up before the fight. Daisy has a huge scar around her ankle because of this. It makes my blood boil thinking of what happened to her, and I am so beyond thrilled that her new owner adopted her and gave her a chance to have a better life.

Considering her history, it’s not surprising that Daisy is uncomfortable with other dogs. Her owner would bring her up to the dog park every single day, trying to “socialize” her, when in reality, he was just terrifying her by forcing her to be around so many dogs at once. Almost every day for months on end, Daisy would get into a fight with other dogs at the dog park. I witnessed it countless times. A dog would be playing near her or come up to sniff her, and without warning she would just attack. 

Now, over the past 3 years that I have lived here, I have come to know the resident dogs very well. Dogs that had never displayed any signs of aggression, would be attacked by Daisy without warning or provocation. For a while (about 4 months), the attacks were superficial - Daisy would attack, but her owner would quickly drag her away before she could do any real damage. A lot of people with wonderful, friendly, calm dogs stopped coming to the dog park because for some reason, Daisy decided their dog was a threat. By July, Daisy had attacked about 75% of the dogs in my building, and most people had stopped using the dog park altogether for fear that Daisy would show up.

Finally, another resident confronted the owner. His super friendly golden retriever (“Cinnamon”) had been attacked by Daisy without provocation (a fight that I personally witnessed), and he told Daisy’s owner that he needed to enroll her in behavioral classes and not bring her to the dog park anymore. Daisy’s owner flat out refused. He claimed that, if Daisy had attacked Cinnamon, it must have been because Cinnamon somehow instigated it. 

This all came to a head a couple weeks ago. An 11 year old dog (“Teddy”) was just standing there. Not playing with anyone. Not interested in the other dogs because he’s an old man. Daisy came to the dog park, the owner let her off her leash, and she immediately pounced on Teddy, biting him in the neck, hard. Teddy was screaming and not fighting back. Daisy wouldn’t let go. Finally, the owners managed to get Daisy off of Teddy. Teddy survived, but had a massive wound that needed a lot of stitches. 

Because of this incident, after months of Daisy terrorizing the other dogs (through no fault of her own; it was clearly PTSD from being a bait dog), her owner FINALLY agreed to get her lessons and to stop bringing her to the dog park, instead opting to let her have one-on-one play dates where Daisy would feel less overwhelmed.

**TL;DR: bringing your dog to the dog park when your dog has PTSD from being a bait dog in a dog fighting ring is not a good idea. It not only not only risks the lives of other dogs, but also causes immense psychological harm to your dog.**"	dogs

712	[Help] New dog ALWAYS flops on her back, making it very hard to train her!	"Hello /dogs community! 
I am a brand new dog owner, as in a week ago I got a rescue blue heeler/possibly border collie mix female dog. She is somewhere between 1.5-4 yrs old. So far she has been nothing but extremely sweet, already super attached to me, and well behaved when it come to certain commands (come, down, sit, stop)... 

But when I try to teach her new commands, such as shake, or whenever I try to put her harness on or her leash on, she does this thing where she immediately flops onto her back exposing her belly and won’t get up and sit no matter what I do. She just like dead weights her body on the floor or flops over all the time, but especially when I’m trying to get her to do something or sometimes if I just reach down towards her. I’ve tried getting her to sit up wth treats, which has worked well for getting her to learn to come or going up stairs (she was terrified of stairs at first) but once she flops she doesn’t seem to care. Also she does love going outside and is already great off leash so I don’t think she is scared when I come to her with the harness or leash. 

I give her belly rubs all the time, but sometime I just need her to sit and stay for me! Her default mode just seems to be flopping on her back. 

In general she seems to be a very submissive and very smart dog, but definitely anxious and still adjusting to her new life outside of the shelter. 

Anyways if anyone has any clues into her behavior I would really appreciate some advice! "	dogs

715	[Breeds] What Kind of Dog Should I Get?	"Introduction** 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? * No, this will not be my first dog. I've owned 3 and have trained them all extensively and successfully. 


 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? * I prefer to go through a reputable breeder like before, but I'm totally open to rescuing a dog. 




 3) Describe your ideal dog. * My ideal dog is one that's eye catching, loyal, and maybe likes cuddling and definitely likes playing. I don't want a small dog. Medium is great but large and up is preferred. 




 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? * I'm very interested in herding dogs as my current dog is a Border Collie and I've always loved all herding dogs, but I love Salukis, Dobermans, and Norweigan Elkhounds. 



  5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? * Anything and everything. Basic obedience to walking off leash to walking backwards on two legs. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get my point. 




 **Care Commitments** 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? * As much time as the dog requires. While it would be nice to have a dog that is content at my feet as I do work, I'm totally open to one that's an absolute attention maniac. Border collie owner, baby.




 7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? * Currently I don't know, as I'm looking for a dog in the future, but I can say that I would like to be able to run with my dog, walk trails, go swimming, and take it to the dog park.



8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? * I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make my dog as happy and healthy as possible. While I have a hard time trimming long haired dogs, I would be willing to pay a professional. 




 **Personal Preferences** 9) What size dog are you looking for? * As long as it's not below the average female border collie size. I don't really like owning small dogs. I have a phobia of being licked or bitten by small dogs as well. Don't ask, its complicated. Not to say they aren't adorable or anything, they're just not for me. Unless it's a bulldog or a corgi, in that case I'm all over them. 




 10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? * Shedding and slobber? No big deal. Current border collie is the biggest drooler ever. Shedding? Yeah, I'm allergic to anything with fur at least until I get used to the specific pet, but I grew up with 3 cats and a long haired border collie. I don't care anymore. Barking? My current border is also a fan of the bork bork and I'm fine with her barking out the window, but it's a little much when she barks at literally everything else. 




 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? * Honestly not too important, I think I'd be too scared that something bad would happen like a surprise dog attack or a car or them running off or getting stolen even if they could. Would be nice though. 





 **Dog Personality and Behavior** 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? * I'd really like a snuggly dog. At least a hug a week maybe? I know most dogs don't really like hugs. 



 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? * I'm used to eager-to-please border collies, so I think I'd prefer that. 




 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? * here's where it's really important. I would like a dog who can intimidate an intruder and wouldn't hesitate to defend me or anyone else its bonded with, but I'd also like one that doesn't immediately attack or growl at someone and could be very friendly. 




15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? * not really. The anxiety that would give me is a bit too much. 




16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? * Dogs breed that bite often aren't really preferred. 




 **Lifestyle** 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? * I don't currently know the answer. 




 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * it would be just me.



 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? * I would like to have a cat as well. 





 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? * probably not, but in its lifetime if I have children or take it to my regular park it would have to be a dog that won't be aggressive in any way towards a child.




 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? * Dont currently know the answer.




 22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? * California. Unless you count our stupid ban on axolptal salamanders and ferrets, as far as I'm aware we're pretty chill.






 ANSWER 23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? * Hot summer. Very hot summer. Winter can get cold, but it rarely snows. 


 **Additional Information and Questions** 24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. * No additional information. 25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

716	[help] Has anyone dealt with hypothyroidism in their pup?	"TLDR found out my dog has hypothyroidism and looking for advice!

4 years ago my husband found 2 baby pups by a dumpster while working...so I know nothing about breed or parents. Friends adopted the boy and we kept the girl and she has always been so active with endless energy. About 10-12 months ago I started noticing that she got tired much quicker than I was used to, but once she rested a bit the energy came back. I assumed it was due to her getting older and calming down. Then I noticed she had put on some weight and even when I reduced her food intake the weight wouldn’t come off. She’s always had this “look” - everyone says she looks pitiful all the time, but I started thinking she looked sadder than normal. Luckily I’m one of those obsessive dog moms who feels the need to tell our vet every tiny little thing I’ve been noticing out of the ordinary. So when I took her to the vet for this weird rash on her belly, I made sure to mention her energy and mood, as well as some weird skin color changing we’d been watching. Her skin used to be light pink and over time it’s become covered in dark spots! So, because of all of these symptoms together, he wanted to do blood tests and mentioned the possibility of hypothyroidism. Thank goodness he listened to me and put two and two together! We learned that she definitely has it and immediately put her on medication. The rash was actually a staph infection that had developed, and we’ve dealt with 2 more bouts of it since. We are still balancing out her meds and trying to get some unknown allergies under control. The hypothyroidism makes it much more likely that a simple rash from environmental allergies could turn into a staph infection...it’s just nonstop chasing symptoms and trying to find ways to help her feel better! Does anyone else deal with hypothyroidism in their dog? I would love some input on various things that have helped and if you’re using medication or natural treatments to keep it under control. We are just starting out on this journey but I’m hoping there are some people out there who have lots of experience and advice! I just want my little nugget to be comfortable and happy!"	dogs
717	[help] ways to adopt dog without landlord check?	"So, first and foremost, I’m allowed to have a dog. I signed a lease 10 years ago with my landlord that specifically states I can have one pet. My girlfriend’s 70 pound hound mutt lived with me until recently, but then they both moved. 

My landlord got injured months ago and is hardly ever home, it takes a long time for me to get ahold of her. I left her a message asking about a new dog but have yet to hear back. I had to get a new fridge recently and I ended up buying one myself and taking it off the rent, which was easier. Furthermore, I no longer have a lease as we have been just doing a handshake agreement for the last 7 years or so on renewal. A few months back my landlord bumped into my girlfriend and I in the street and acknowledged the dog was living with me - no issues. However, I worry that, if someone did call my landlord, she might reconsider letting me have a pet now that it’s a new dog instead of my girlfriend’s dog, which she met.

So long story short - I’d like to adopt an adult or senior dog, but looking to keep the process simple. Are there shelters out there that would allow this? For what it’s worth, I either plan on buying my place in a year or moving/buying. 

Thanks!"	dogs

722	[Help] Dog vomiting and stinky after daycare, why?	"My 2.5-year-old female spayed lab/golden retriever mix loves going to daycare. We usually have her there for about four hours three times a week, from about 1:00-5:00pm. We've noticed for quite some time that she gets nasty farts after she comes home from daycare, which is odd because it doesn't seem like there would be time for something to go all the way through her digestive system between when we drop her off and 7:00 when we usually start smelling things.

But twice recently she's had vomiting spells after daycare. Both times she wasn't interested in her food at 5:30 when we usually feed her - today we picked her up at 4:30 so she'd had an hour to calm down first. Both times she eventually ate her dinner, and both times she threw it up a couple of hours later.

Tonight she ate at around 5:45, and was intermittently whining until around 10:00 when she went outside and threw up a large quantity of food and grass. We had given her opportunities to throw up outside several times before that, and she'd eaten quite a bit of grass.

She went out and ate more grass a while later, then settled down near me for a while until just now (11:30) when she went out and threw up the remaining food in her stomach. She horked several times so I'm pretty sure it's all out of there.

She's also had stinky farts this evening again. I don't understand what's going on - have any of you had experience with something like this? I'm planning on calling the vet on Monday. 

She is known to be a poop-eater (deer poop is her favorite), so I wouldn't be surprised if the staff are unable to catch her in time every once in a while. She is also allergic to virtually everything, so if she ate another dog's poop it likely would have allergens in it. But I'm not sure if that lines up with her symptoms, and there didn't look to be poop in her vomit. (Ugh, gross. But I checked.)"	dogs

Hearing the poor things crying every night breaks my heart. I’ve called local animal control twice and reported both the crying and the conditions I witnessed. I’m convinced one of the times action was taken and the dogs were taken away, but they were able to get new ones judging by the dogs I see now, who aren’t the same as the ones I saw a few months ago. There was one beautiful red pit who looked two or three who I don’t see anymore. 

Another neighbor who borders them say they’ve had trouble in the past with these people and their dogs, but it was mainly the humans being irresponsible about controlling their dog and choosing to be petty back towards the other neighbor. 

Confrontation is definitely not an option as there was recently an event at that household involving police surrounding the property, along with helicopters, cops in our backyards, and shouting over a megaphone. That in addition to the security cameras all over the house (which is unusual for our neighborhood) gives me a bad feeling about these people. 

I’m at a loss at what to do here. 

Tldr: I can hear neighbors dogs constantly crying in distress and have seen their poor living conditions. Humans are probably criminals and calling AC hasn’t seemed too effective.  How can I help?"	dogs
724	[vent] dog park predatory behavior	After a 4 year routine of daily dog park visits without an incident, there is now a German Shepherd at the dog park that seems intent on killing my miniature poodle.  A month it pinned him down out of the blue for about ten seconds and was viciously snarling but did not drawn blood.  Today was milder but still almost got out of hand.  While I was talking to the owner, his dog attacked ANOTHER small dog, prompting an old granny to run out screaming and wacking it with her ball thrower thingy.  The owner is incredibly confrontational, and scary himself.  A very school shootery, redneck, military kind of vibe.  He of course blames me for bringing a small dog to the park, despite the fact there are a minimum of 10 small dogs there every day.  He insists the first attack was not an attack because “an attack is blood. An attack is bones crunching”.  Just very creepy.  I guess I have no choice but to swallow my pride and stop going to the dog park.  I try not to be a fearful person but something bad is gonna happen w this German and it seems to specifically be obsessed with my dog.  My dog must look like a fluffy little rabbit to it or something.  What a bummer.  Fuck this guy.  	dogs

726	[discussion] I feel strongly about adopting but	"I am also kinda stuck on one breed and can’t find any compatible ones in the shelters. We have small kids and a cat and live where there are lots of dogs. We also have our friends and their dogs over sometimes so we need a dog that’s cool with all that. We can give a dog an awesome home with lots of love and adventures but I feel conflicted on how to get that dog. We tried adopting one a while ago. He was the breed we wanted and still young so the shelter didn’t see any reason why he wouldn’t fit our needs but he ended up having some serious aggression issues. He bit two people sort of badly who came to our house. He was just uncontrollable whenever we had guests. Even if he was in a different room in a crate he went ballistic trying to claw his way out. We felt we couldn’t have him around our kids so we had to give him back to his foster mom. 

So now I feel like if we want that breed we either have to buy one from a breeder or we will have to settle on a different breed. Our shelter is overrun with pit bulls and they basically are giving them away because they are overcrowded. I love pit bulls and that’s one of the only other breeds that I would really want but my husband doesn’t want one. The only other breed my husband wants I don’t want because we live in a very hot climate and I feel like a husky would be miserable here and not able to go on our outdoor adventures. 

I am a dog lover. I have literally never met a dog I didn’t like so I know I’d love any dog we get. I feel really strongly about adopting vs. breeding because of how many dogs are put to sleep at our shelters. So I guess I just want you guys to tell me to get over it and get a different breed haha. I just am so stuck on getting the breed I want and when I look at pictures of our old dog who died and pictures of those puppies my heart explodes. Ahhh "	dogs

728	[Discussion] It's Hurricane/tropical storm season!	"With TS Florence coming at the Carolinas late this week and TS Nine/Helene not far behind, it's time for some bad weather prep!

Make sure you have at least these things ready in an easy to grab place: water, dog food, multiple copies of vaccination records, and an extra leash. I personally keep them in my car, but whenever it's easy for you is best. 

From there also make sure if you plan to evacuate that you have pet friendly places in mind. If you plan to stay with family, make sure they know as well that your pets will be coming.

729	[Help] My dog got attacked at the dog park. Should I take him back?	"My dog is an 8 month, 55 lbs., lab/shepherd mix. He loves to play at the park, wrestling and chasing the other dogs. And he’s not a generally timid dog, he’ll play fight one on one with the best of them. He’s pretty goofy and uncoordinated, falls down and trips a lot, and something about him sets other dogs to chasing him. The last couple times there have been older dogs that have teamed up and chased him, biting at his sides, until he’s running frantically, tail between his legs, clearly terrified. He runs and hides behind me eventually and I push the other dogs back, and it’s over, so not too much drama. 
Today it was the same thing, but it escalated to the point where my dog was on his back with another dog attacking his neck before I could get to him. He was crying and panting, super stressed. He has a gash an inch long, not deep enough for stitches, but bad obviously. The owner of the attacker just called his dog and did nothing. 
This was a particularly bad incident, most of the time it’s not like that, but I can’t decide if I want to take my guy back. If there’s something about him that’s setting off dogs to chase and attack, should I just avoid it? Is he just too young? He wants to play but I don’t want him getting hurt that badly, or getting scared to go back.

731	[Help] My Brothers two Rottweilers keep attacking my German shepherd.	My brother moved his dogs into our back yard. A pair of rottweilers male and female. They are very aggressive, while my dog is more passive. They snap at my dog during feeding time and so I check them so my German shepherd can eat, female. Yesterday I saw some flies on her ears and so I applied ointment. Today at four in the morning, I was woken by barks and snarls, the two rotts were both biting my dogs ears and neck viciously. I yelled and yelled and they would not stop, until I hit one with a steel chair and they both ran off, and stayed away but together. I've brought my dog inside and will separate them at day break but I don't know what to do? as I type this I can occasionally hear the the two fight amongst them selves. 	dogs
732	[Help] Dog is extremely afraid of bees.	"Hi, as my title states - my Golden Ret x Poodle mix is terrified of bees. And as luck would have it, I, her owner, too am afraid of bees. We have bees, hornets and dragonflies flying into our home, and my first instinct is to shriek and run away. This triggers her flight instinct and she will literally go into panic mode and try to escape. 

I've seen her try to squeeze through the stair bannister and gotten herself stuck in the gap. She's clawed at bedroom doors trying to get in. She'll run around in circles in a panic and doesn't seem to be able to hear us when we try to snap her out of it. 

I've started controlling myself and not scream when I see a bee so I don't startle her, but sometimes there'll be a giant bee perched at eye level and I'll walk into a room and it's in my face. Then the scream comes out before I can even register that I've screamed. Also, she panics when she hears the buzzing sound of a bee or a dragonfly and that'll set her off as well. 

It has gotten to the point where now she recognises the *word*. I can control my shrieking but when I get someone to catch the bee, I'll go like, ""\_\_\_\_, come help me get this bee out of the house!"" She'll hear the word BEE and immediately she'll start panicking and try to escape. It doesn't even need to be the word BEE, I can be talking about beef steak and she'll hear the word ""BEE""-f  and panic. My family calls me ""Debbie"" and even that has set her off. If you ask ""Where's the bee?"", she'll look around the room in a panic. Any word that sounds like BEE is now taboo around her.

Any ideas on what to do and how to help?

735	[Breeds] Need some help finding out what dog I should get!	"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have grown up around a Yorkie and helped raise a Shiba Inu with my family, however this would be my first time having a dog that is the sole responsibility of my boyfriend and I. I trained my Shiba how to walk, potty trained her, and took her to obedience classes because obedience was never her forte. She could listen to certain commands like sit and stay, however she was easily distracted which meant she could never be off leash (typical Shiba).

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Preferably would like a breeder because I want to experience raising an animal and training it with the help of my boyfriend. I am not opposed to rescue however, but seeing as how I don't feel I'm very experienced I don't want to risk adopting an abused or aggressive dog because I wouldn't be able to give it the correct training.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* I would love to have a dog that was very loyal and I don't mind clingy dogs. I would love to have a dog that could go off leash without much problem as we have a lot of local parks in my area where the pup could roam around safely. I prefer bigger dogs just because I personally have never owned one and I would love to experience it. I don't mind spending time training and walking the dog as that would encourage me to exercise as well and I don't mind active dogs, however hyperactivity may be a bit much. I also don't mind grooming, but not crazy shedding.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My boyfriend and I have SERIOUSLY considered Huskies because of how gorgeous they are, however they do shed A LOT and I have heard that they shouldn't be trusted off-leash. I LOVE Golden Retrievers because they fit the loyal and obedient stereotype. I also like German Shepherds, Rottweilers, and Dobermans because of their obedience and intelligence. Even though I am not in love with small dogs, I have always had good experiences with Corgi's and I really love their attributes too.
* Breeds I don't prefer are: Jack Russels - I feel like these dogs are too active and I'm not a fan of the wirey hair. We have a miniature poodle and we love her a whole lot, but I wouldn't get another one.

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The basic obedience of sit, come, stay, lie down, roll over, but I would love to teach them more advanced things as well, maybe take agility classes. The biggest thing is definitely the heel command. I would love to take my dog on road trips and go hiking so if my dog could tolerate that, I'd definitely be happy.

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 3 hrs with walking, but I would have three days a week off to be able to spend more time on maintenance tasks (grooming, long walks, etc.)

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* A few 15-20 min walks a day and maybe a visit to the dog park at least once a week. On my off days from work I could definitely spend up to 2 hours on walking or exercising in local parks or to the market.

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am willing to maintain a grooming routine of heavy grooming once a week, probably bath every two-three weeks as needed. I don't mind paying a professional to help with major tasks.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium - Large (but not like Great Dane)

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* No slobber please. I don't mind shedding since I'm used to Shiba Inu fur, but I don't think I would like much more than that. I don't mind vocal dogs, but nothing too crazy as to not disrupt neighbors.

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* V important!

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly for sure

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager to please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* It would be nice for the dog to recognize the difference between a threat and just a visitor. We only ever have the same people come to the house, so for my dog to mainly be friendly would be nice. I would however like our dog to be intimidating as we do live in the city.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Nope nope nope

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression and general aloofness

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 6 hours at most

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My boyfriend is very cleanly so having a dog that isn't too prone to being super stinky or shedding would be nice, but not a deal-breaker as I'm sure with proper grooming that shouldn't be much of an issue.

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have a toy poodle \[9yr F\] and I would love a family oriented and pet friendly dog.

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not really

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I don't rent right now, however it may be something that could happen in the future. I don't have specific regulations on hand.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Saint Petersburg, FL. Its mainly city/suburb with a lot of dog parks, grassy areas, and there's even a dog beach! I think there is a law banning selling Pit Bulls, but not adopting them from shelters (correct me if I'm wrong).

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 80s to 90s. Winter: 50s to 60s"	dogs

737	[help] Rescue dog process	"So I have been working with a rescue since April to adopt a dog. One thing after the other has been happing and the process has been horribly slow. I told myself “no you will get a dog from the rescue”. I went through a approval process with interviews, references, Home visits, and more. But I was approved. 

Today I meet what I thought would be my perfect dog through the rescue I have been watching him for 3 months waiting for the opportunity to meet him. I meet the dog he is 2 times bigger then the normal bread of dog, he is very sweet, obviously mixed with a much larger dog, and being that he was only 1 the dog was still gonna get bigger. I feel heartbroken. I knew he was not the right fit so I declined to adopt him. 

I also feel fed up. I want to be a good person and adopt one from a rescue but I also want the dog that fits with me. Getting a dog is a HUGE commitment and I don’t wanna get just any dog just cus, I want the new dog to become my family. 

After 5 months of waiting and working with this rescue do I just keep waiting or start looking elsewhere? "	dogs

739	[Help] Dog sick after boarding	"I recently went on vacation and had to board my two dogs.  I dropped them off Thursday afternoon and picked them up on Monday afternoon.  We took their regular food and snacks for them to eat so they wouldn't have to eat different food.  Everything was fine with them until the Thursday after I picked them up and one of them developed diarrhea, the other one is perfectly fine still.  I didn't think much of it because I had read many articles saying that the stress of boarding can cause it in some dogs but this is the fourth day she's had it now.  She's not acting any differently, she's still eating and drinking fine, there isn't any mucus or blood in her stool, so I'm not seeing any other signs that something is wrong with her.  I'm just wondering if I should take her to the vet tomorrow, it's closed today since it's Sunday, or see if it will run its course.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My dog is a 2.5 year old (why do they grow older?) labrador who loves the snow. Every winter going out is an ordeal for the pooch because not all the condos and homeowners  in our urban neighbourhood use dog-friendly salt to break the ice. 

I've tried Musher's Secret but within minutes he starts lifting his paws off the ground so clearly it isn't very effective. The balloon shoes were rejected by him too and honestly getting them on him is an ordeal even with treats.

I have an 11 pound minischnauzer with a thin non-wirey coat. She's about 7 now so I doubt she will want to play in the snow all that much when she first encounters it. I lived in Iowa for four years while getting my bachelors, but that was much more of a dry windy cold with little snow. We currently live in Florida but she was born in Puerto Rico and is not used to the cold. Like even in the Florida winters she would shiver without a sweater.

I'm worried the flimsy sweaters I have won't be enough to keep her warm, especially since snow is... well... wet. I was also unaware about the whole salt thing and how they shouldn't lick that stuff (luckily she's super picky so I doubt I'll have an issue but you never know). I would like advice because I grew up in Puerto Rico and my knowledge of snow is still limited. I love my dog and I know she has a sensitive stomach and sensitive skin, so I want to try to make the move as easy on her as possible.

748	[RIP] Kiva Maria, Portuguese Water Dog, 5 months.	"Kiva saw a specialist today. She hasn’t been doing well since [my last post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/9coaa1/discussion_sometimes_you_do_everything_right_and/) she was at an emergency vet’s last night. They took more X-rays. Her pneumonia hadn’t improved. She developed a fever and wasn’t tolerating the feeding tube we had placed.

They called us this morning, but we were already on our way in. That’s our baby, we couldn’t leave her alone. She put on a brave face when we got there. As our visit went on we saw how tired she was. She’s down to 15 lbs. every breath was a struggle. By the end she could barely lift her head.

The specialist said this was never a swallowing disease. She said it’s a systemic neuromuscular condition. It’s degenerative, and kiva was lucky to have had five months, especially five months with us. She said it looked just like dysautonomia, but she’s convinced it was congenital. She said if kiva beat her pneumonia, and that didn’t look likely, that there was nothing to look forward to. She was going to catch another case, or she was going to keep losing muscle function and eventually, there wouldn’t be anything left to do. She said it would be cruel to put her through. She’s already fought so hard, for so long.

We took kiva outside and had some pictures. We loved her and she loved the breeze and the grass. It was a beautiful day. We got her feeding tube out and she seemed grateful. It was clear to everyone there how loved she was, and how special a puppy we had. We knew kiva was never going to give up, and we had to make this decision for her. That little puppies heart is indomitable, but her body wasn’t able to keep up with it.

We held her and gave her belly rubs and reassurance the whole time. She was very content on my lap or my partner’s, but she was so tired that she began to fall off. We wrapped her in a quilt from home, with her favorite stuffed puppy, Ruthie. We told her stories about our old dogs that had passed on, who would take over from here and help raise her now that we couldn’t. Grandma Guinness. Great Aunt Holly. Seamus and Bear. We told her we would always be a happy little family, because she would always be a part of us, but she was also taking a piece of us with her. We told her some day, down the road when everyone was ready, that mama and daddy would come for her again, and we would run and play and chew and dig and go shopping at home goods. She’ll always be daddy’s princess, and mama’s galpalsisterfriend.

She’s in the back seat right now, all bundled up. They made us a clay paw print. We dropped off flowers for our local vet, who went through this with us and who tried so hard. She cried with us too. We’re heading to my parents, to grandma’s house, her favorite place in the world. My partner has asked many times this week - “what next?” And I’ve answered that I don’t know. We just have to love her every minute we’ve got. I think we managed to let her know that she’ll be loved forever and ever as well. She’ll stay at grandma’s house, and we’ll come to visit. Someday we might visit with another dog, but not yet. You can’t imagine that someone that small could leave such a big space when she’s gone, but kiva’s spirit was ten feet tall. 

We did everything we could have done. The specialist said we did more than she expected of any pet parent. She had the best five months a puppy could ask for. She absolutely loved, for every second until the end, but the vet said she was running on borrowed time from the beginning. Today has been tough, but we’re going forward. We’re going to keep living the way kiva would have wanted us to - adventurous, mischievous, and unapologetic, but loving too. Kiva was a ray of sunshine, and she never met a person in her short life who wasn’t happier because they had done so. She changed her world, and she changed our world. We will miss her, but she’s at peace. She’s finally, for the first time ever, able to rest. We miss her, but we have each other, and we’re happy to have been able to give her everything we did. We wouldn’t change a second of it.

Rest easy good girl, it’s bed time now. All my love, and good night."	dogs
749	[Help] Preparing Dogs for Winter?	"Hi everyone! I just relocated from Florida to Colorado with our three dogs - a lab/shepherd mix, boxer/bulldog/amstaff mix and bull terrier/bulldog/sharpei/mutt. They are slowly adjusting to life without a huge yard and having to walk on a leash, but I'm absolutely clueless about what I should know for winter/snow.

They are indoor dogs so we will have the heat on inside, but do I need boots/jackets for them? I know to avoid rock salt for their paws, but what else should I be aware of? How do I introduce them to snow? 

I've tried googling but most of my answers were how to entertain them inside, which we have covered from hurricanes.

751	[help] My two year old Golden is spooked by something in our backyard	"Hello, I have a two year old Golden Retriever - Max - who is suddenly afraid to go in our backyard.

We have a large yard, three sides fenced, around .50 acre in a town in New Hampshire.

Day 1, I immediately observed Wednesday evening that he was distracted by something unknown and showed zero interest in playing. I can’t express how uncharacteristic this is. He briefly displayed similar body language / behavior to when he hears a gunshot, or fireworks, so we head back inside where he goes directly to the bathroom - his safe spot - which he only utilizes during storms and fireworks. 

Day 2, Max still uninterested in playing outside, which immediately struck me as odd because even when there were fireworks the night before, there was never any carryover fear the next day. In the backyard he seemed to have caught onto a scent and chased it around the yard - tail pointed straight in the air. 

He got to the end of our yard (near our neighbor’s yard, looked at their yard and barked once. He ran around the yard appearing to chase a smell or something unknown. When I tried to chase him around, he would lead me back into the house - which he will only do if a storm is coming, or he hears gunshots or fireworks.

So, I put him inside (it was early morning, with school traffic and construction, did not want to heighten his anxiety) and walked down to the Vet and explained the scenario and she wonders if maybe he sensed a bear - which is possible because there has been talk that bears have been active here recently. 

Days 3 and 4 (today) were identical to day 2 - we go out to the backyard and he appears to sense something unknown, and when I try to chase him, he leads me back inside the house where he wants to play.

Just some observations: he shows zero body language of pain, no whimpering, no aggression, no whining. He is a ball of energy and loves to play. Inside the house, nothing has changed. He still sleeps normally, naps, eats, treats, plays. 

To me, something has spooked him. He appears to be highly sensitive to a scent or something that has not washed away even in the rain to the point he won’t play in our yard.

Do you have any ideas other than what google suggests under “10 reasons your dog is afraid to go outside”…

can a bear scent linger for this long?


TLDR; dog appears to be spooked by something unknown in our backyard, going on four days now - but happy to play inside - eating, sleeping habits unfazed 

I’ve already googled “my dog is afraid to go outside” so I’m hoping for less generic answers

756	[Help] Help me decide on what length/material to use as a long line for pup? Hiking is in our future.	"I wanted to get a long line for hiking/recall training. I have a 6 month old border collie pup I adopted and I wanted to get something so we could have more room for training outside in more open areas. Haven't owned her long enough to practice off leash work and I want to build a foundation for camping in the future.

I used to own a 50 foot horse check line when I owned a GSD. I wish I knew where that was, but I think I've long since given it away. I would usually clip it to a harness and let it drag in a field we would explore. But the thing was so bulky it made it inconvenient to take with me. 

I was thinking maybe 30 ft lines would be better. She's about 25 lbs right now, I just want something that won't get tangles/twised so flat leashes are a no-no. What do you guys use for hikes? 

I'm also open to anything else people like to bring on hikes. Or tips for long car rides to the trailheads/or whatever tidbits you may think are useful.

757	[Help] How to have dogs and cats get along or at least tolerate each other in the same room?	"My family and I adopted an (almost) 4 y/o Australian Shepherd last month. We rehomed her from a friend of a friend’s family. We have two grey cats who grew up with a smaller dog, i wanna say it was one of those maltese dogs or something but it was small with curly hair. The other cat we took in because my uncle found her alone in his back yard. So we have 3 cats who we’ve all had for about five years. 

Hunter, one of the cats that grew up with the small dog seems to tolerate the Aussie but if she gets too close then he (cat) will run away. Same with the others but they all will hang around the stairs and watch the dog because there’s a gate preventing the dog from going upstairs. 

The dog does get nervous around the cats sometimes but most of the time she’s very alert and if we aren’t paying attention to her she will kind of scare the cats away. I know by nature Aussies have a lot of energy, and so she probably want to herd the kitties. 

I know it’ll take some time but is there anything my family and I can do in order for the dog to not chase the cats the second she sees them? The cats are curious and like to watch her from the stairs but it’s when the dog runs to them. It’s kinda funny because when she runs up to the gate it’s like she kind of goes “BOO!” to make them run away. We don’t force the cats and the dog to be together but we think just allowing them to see each other through the gate is enough. 

Any advice? I feel like i forgot some details but anything helps! "	dogs
758	[Breeds] Looking for a low-medium energy dog who enjoys snuggling and lounging as much as occasional hikes.	"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*  No. I grew up with dogs my entire life. However, I have never owned my own. My family provided basic obedience training to these dogs using positive reinforcement.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

*  I have no preference.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I want to dog to be kind of a couch potato.
* The dog would need to get along with cats as I have two of them.
* I would love a dog that wants to go on hikes, swimming, or just a car ride buddy.
* The dog would be comfortable for 9 hours on weekdays while I am at work.
* This dog also needs to be able to fit on a boat.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I am interested in medium sized dogs. I was looking at Pit Bull, American Staffy, English Bulldog (I know Bulldogs won't be able to do hikes). I am open to suggestions.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience.

**Care Commitments**

&amp;#x200B;

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1 hour. That's not to say I'll ignore them after an hour.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*  I want a sort of lazy dog who doesn't want to be walked all the time. Short 15-30 minute walks or some time in the back yard.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

*  Minimal grooming.

**Personal Preferences**

&amp;#x200B;

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

*  I am looking for a medium sized dog that is between 30 - 60 pounds.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*  Shedding and slobber don't really matter to me. I live in a townhouse so I'd rather the dog not be a huge barker but I understand that dogs bark.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*  Somewhat important. I'd like the dog to come back if I called.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Both. I want a dog who can snuggle on the couch but can also be comfortable on their own. I don't necessarily want a velcro dog. Seeing as I have two cats, I'd like to be able to give all of my animals love without them stepping over each other.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Both. Similar to above. I don't want a velcro dog but I want a dog that will listen and wants to hangout in the same room at least.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

*  I want my dog to be gentle with strangers &amp; visitors. It is okay if the dog barks when someone knocks on the door or enters the yard so long as he knows to stop.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*  No. I know dogs and cats are different but I have had bad experiences with aggressive dogs and I do not wish to deal with aggressive behavior. I would not necessarily be able to trust a dog who is aggressive with other dogs with my cats.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No aggression.
* Minimal separation anxiety.

**Lifestyle**

&amp;#x200B;

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I work full time. The dog will be alone with the cats for 9 hours a day on average. Also, both my wife and I leave for work early in the morning and we don't have a lot of time between waking up and leaving for work.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

*  My wife will help care for the dog. She is helping me fill out the questionnaire. The answers to these questions are the dog we both want.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

*  We have two DSH cats. They are social and curious but cautious about dogs.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Sort-of. The neighborhood is filled with children and we may have a child in the next few years.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

*  N/A

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

*  There are no breed restrictions where we live.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Mid-Atlantic. Summer: 87°F Winter: 32°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

&amp;#x200B;

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

*  One of my biggest issues is that in the morning we dont have a lot of time. We quickly go from waking up to leaving for work. 


25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

*  N/A

759	[Help] Best place to get a second dog from?	"Hi /r/dogs!


I'm in the very early stages of considering a second dog and could use some opinions. Trying to decide between finding a breeder or adopting from one of two shelters which have different requirements. (Will also look at other rescues but mostly looking at their requirements on preadoption introduction.)


Some background: 
My boyfriend and I bought a house with a fenced in yard about 2 months ago. I currently have a 4 year old Australian Shepherd. She goes to daycare multiple times a week and loves other dogs and fetch. She is not perfect though, she is a bit reactive mostly to strangers passing her house and sometimes on leash. We've been working with our vet and she's been on some antianxiety medication for a month now and it had been great. Her anxiety is markedly improving and we've been able to more successfully counter condition her triggers. Assuming she continues to improve and knowing she's awesome with other dogs, I think she'd be great with a second dog. She is well trained but obviously we would want her anxiety managed first. 


I'm sure there are a lot of rescues in the area that I haven't looked at but mostly I need your opinion on a few things:


One, if we adopt, one of the places I've looked at so far requires your dog to meet the new dog. I am in theory ok with that except with my dogs anxiety around new people I'm not sure bringing her to a shelter with a lot of stimulation to meet her new friend is the best? She's either perfect or anxious in new situations and it's not always easy to predict. I would hate for her to be afraid and not be able to be introduced well. But I can also appreciate their reasoning of wanting to make sure the dogs get along so you don't bring the other back...


The other place I've looked at so far does not recommend the dogs meet first. Which I don't know, maybe that's better?


There is also the option of looking for a breeder (and deciding what breed and all that goes with that). My current dog's breeder does not breed anymore and also I was pretty new. She had done a bunch of genetic testing so I thought she was a good breeder (first dog) but I later understood that there were a few signs I missed that would have told me she still wasn't a great breeder (mom was anxious for example. My dog acts just like her mom when I met her around new people.)

I'm also considering fostering but haven't looked into that much at all.

Another note would be I'd ideally want a young puppy (8-12 weeks) or a dog 1-3 years old. And it would be no sooner than 2 months (adopting) from now but probably next year some time (especially when a breeder).


Anyway thoughts are appreciated! I'm still early in the process"	dogs
760	[Discussion] Golden/Lab recently diagnosed with Vestibular disease	"Just thought I'd share our story. 

Our golden/lab ""Graham"" has been diagnosed with Vestibular disease. He's 16 and generally doesn't have a lot issues but this past Thursday morning it was like bam! Vomiting, stumbling, head tilt he had no clue what was going on (neither did we). Driving him to the vet soon afterwards we noticed the eye movement. Very sad to witness. I know he's lived past his average age but I'm being greedy and would like him to stay with us longer. Vet checked him over and Vestibular disease it was. They gave him some fluids and meds and we brought him back home. 

Thursday afternoon/evening he just laid down. Wouldn't move, eyes rapidly moving back and forth. Very sad to see. No signs or symptoms leading up to this event. Day before he was moving around like normal. It's now Saturday morning and I can thankfully report Graham is now eating, drinking, more alert, sitting upright and his eye movement is barely noticeable sometimes not happening at all. He still walks very unsteady but we help him around the house and carry him outside. He has a very slight head tilt still but not too bad. Rescued him back in '04 and I will never be prepared for life without him. 

Apparently this can return or happen again from what I've read. Just trying to educate myself more on this condition.

Also - if I just poor water on the floor, she drinks it, but she rarely drinks form the bowl.

764	[Breeds] Can anyone help me identify this dog breed?	"I met a guy with the most beautiful dog I had ever seen today. He told me it was an Australian Shepherd, and I didn't think that sounded right but I couldn't picture one in my head at the time so I figured he knew what he was talking about. I went home and looked up Australian Shepherds and realized this dog was nothing at all like an Australian Shepherd.

I know this will be tough from my description, but I will do my best. And I know he could be a mix, but maybe not? Even if he is, I'm puzzled about what he is.

The thing that struck me first was his stoic yet sweet gaze. It sort of reminded me of a Pit Bull because its eyes were kind of far apart and were this beautiful yellowish color. Its ears were flat and folded over (as opposed to sticking up). His stout looked a bit like a Staffordshire Terrier but not quite as chiseled or rugged around the mouth and a little longer. The skin looked thinner if that makes sense. His face looked smoother than a Straffordshire. He was large, taller than any Pitbull I've ever seen.

I'm not sure how to explain his coat, I don't see it when you look up coat types. It was that short, kind of pokey hair, but looks smooth, and was light brown.

I don't know, that's all I've got. He was literally the dog of my dreams. I'm so disappointed. I've been looking for a dog for a while now and thought he was perfect."	dogs
765	[Help] Trouble narrowing down from these 5 breeds- Can you tell me about them?	"Im a bit frustrated with some of the conflicting breed info out there. However, after doing a bunch of research &amp; taking into consideration the responses from the breed questionnaire I filled out a couple months ago, I’ve narrowed down Dog#2’s breed. The only problem is that these 5 breeds are all totally different types of dogs, literally from totaaaallly different groups of dogs. Before looking at the breeds themselves below is my “must have” traits list, and it appears that these 5 dogs all more or less hit all of these. 

- no larger than 60 lbs
- low-moderate shedding 
- low prey drive 
- good to be off leash
- happy with max daily 3-5K walk (weekends are 10-15k hikes and 1-2x weekly daycare) 
- friendly &amp; relatively quiet 
- confident but calm disposition or able to be taught to relax fairly easily 

Narrowed down dog breeds: 
1. Bearded Collie
2. Canaan Dog (pretty sure our mutt is a good chunk Canaan!) 
3. English Springer Spaniel (I think this one would be too high energy for us)
4. Tibetan Terrier
5. Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier

So is the tea candle/soapy water thing bullshit, or are the fleas probably not in the house and the dog just keeps getting reinfested out on walks?

This all came together with the fact that I need ways to pay for college, making me passively consider selling pet portraits. However, I have nowhere near the amount of experience needed to start doing that. This is where I ask you, r/dogs, for help!

I need to practice painting dogs, and I also need paintings to be able to showcase my abilities. 

I’m sure some of you would love having your dog painted. All you have to do is post a picture of your dog on this thread. If I choose to paint it, I’ll send you a picture of the painting. You can make a print of it, use it as a phone background, it’s yours :)

If you want the physical painting, you can give me a donation for however much you would like for it. However, I will have to set a minimum donation to cover art supplies, probably 5%-10% of my ideal purchase price.

All I ask in return is that I can post a picture of the painting and your dog on social media or a personal website (yet to be created) as an example of what I can do. They will not be sold.

I already asked the mods for permission and they warned me I might need to set a limit, so here goes: I can do 8-12 acrylic paintings. Since I want everyone to get something, I’ll do a continuous contour ink drawing for everyone! (I set a 2 minute timer and don’t take my pen off the paper.) Some ink drawings may be turned into mixed media (water color + ink) paintings.

The Fluffy painting gives a general idea of what you’ll be getting for acrylics, but I do have to warn that it was on larger canvas than I have for these, but I also expect to improve with each painting.

For acrylics, I have sizes 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 9 x 12, and 11 x 14. Max 3 each.

Comment with

* a picture of your dog
* a couple sentences about them
* your preferred background color
* any size or style preferences 
   * I can do realistic or colorful paintings, a looser style, etc

Expect the acrylic paintings over a few weeks and the drawings over a few ~~hours~~. (Edit: Days. So many drawings...)

Edit 1: I can do continuous contours in two minutes, but... I can't bring myself to send poor sketches to other people. They'll be more detailed but take longer, and I can't guarantee the same quality in each sketch.

Edit 2: Made an art Instagram, I'll be posting sketches there [@FluffyFineArt](https://www.instagram.com/fluffyfineart/)

777	[Discussion] Dog Park Etiquette	"I've been going to the same dog park for over 14 years with my pets and it's always been a great experience. The only issues I've witnessed are the occasional scuffle between two or three dogs. Last night however, shortly after I entered the dog park I heard a woman screaming and saw people running towards her. A large mixed breed had locked it's jaws around her little Shiba Inu's back leg and would not let go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what the best way is to get a dog to release it's lock jaw, but eventually people pried the dogs jaws open. There was a lot of blood and the owner was understandably pretty traumatized. I think the dog who was bit will be ok, and really, it was best case scenario for a dog bite - lots of people around and only the back leg. Thank goodness it wasn't the neck. Anyways, we all helped her take photos, find an emergency vet, and get the information of the woman who's dog bit the Shiba Inu.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out that the woman had only rescued the dog who attacked the Shiba 2 DAYS AGO. God damn face palm. Please do not take your recently rescued dogs (who's history you do NOT know) to the dog park. You are liable for whatever your dog does at the dog park and I'm sure that woman will be footing a very expensive emergency vet bill. And rightfully so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Socialize your dogs before taking them to the dog park please. Take them to an obedience class. Introduce them to other dogs slowly. Please have some common sense. Because one person had little common sense, there's now a dog who probably has a broken leg and a woman who is most likely never going to take her dogs back to the dog park again. "	dogs
778	[help] when my dog coughs, my other dogs get scared	"I have 13 year old Shih Tzu and for the past 2 days or so, he’s been making a coughing/hacking sound. What I want to know is why do my other dogs get so scared when it happens? 

This has never happened before. In the past, when he coughs or something they don’t really react to it at all, but now they all run away and hide &amp; start shaking. My other dogs are also Shih Tzus (8 years old &amp; two 5 year olds). They’re a big Shih Tzu Family! (Dad, Mom, Son &amp; Daughter) 

If anyone knows why this happens or why they’re so scared, plz let me know!! Thanks!"	dogs
779	[Discussion] Dog more aggressive after move?	"My dog used to be the sweetest dog who wouldn't hurt a fly (seriously, he just sniffed bugs everytime I wanted him to kill them). But we recently moved around a month ago and things have changed.

He's bitten my boyfriend and his brother numerous times. They like to ""play rough"" with him, and he will growl during this but be gentle while playing. However, sometimes they think he's playing rough and he'll just snap.

Usually, we can trace his aggression to him just not wanting to be moved, or being jealous of my boyfriend. But he has also lunged at people several times. Besides that, the move hasn't seemed to be too difficult for him and he doesn't seem stressed. 

My suspicion is that he might be overstimulated from being near people all the time, and that he has some possession aggression. But I also know a move could be stressful for a pup, so I just wanted to know if there was anything we should try?"	dogs

3. I’m scared I can’t get to gym/see friends/play video games etc because I’ll have a dog 
4. I love dogs and treat them better than I do most humans and since moving out I’ve missed having one and feel like I’m missing something

782	[Help] 7 mo.-old puppy sneezing and has diarrhea	"Hello,

My 7 month-old mutt has started sneezing a lot.  Sometimes there’s clear discharge, but usually no discharge.  I looked in her snout and can’t see any foreign bodies, and she doesn’t paw at her nose at all.  But she does snort and sneeze fairly frequently, and when in her bed she licks her bed a lot.

About the same time I noticed this (a few days ago, after I picked her up from doggy day care) I noticed her stool is not solid.  She has to go fairly frequently, but that could just be because she’s a puppy.  It had been solid for the first couple of weeks after I got her so this has me worried.  She’s a pretty lazy dog when we’re not playing, but I feel this might be lethargy. 

I feed her Blue Buffalo puppy food in the morning and evening.  She gets treats (milk-bone or freeze-dried chicken) when we are working on commands and when she goes to the bathroom outside.  I have been consistent with this menu since I got her in mid-August.

She’s been to the vet once and got a clean bill of health, but I’ve scheduled a vet visit out of caution, but if this sounds like something that will pass, I’d just as soon wait it out with her.

So my question then is: does she have a cold?  Or some other bug that she maybe picked up from another dog at daycare?  Any help would be appreciated."	dogs
783	[Discussion] the right time to spay and neuter?	"So I'm not trying to make this a side choosing thing. I'm only trying to do some information hunting and want to make sure I'm not going down any false paths. Everyone I'm sure has done their own homework and formulated their own best recommendation, and I'm interested to hear all camps.

The discussion in our house about neutering Indy is pretty ongoing, and the examples set in the city we live in are entirely different that the precedent set by dog owners in our home country. Where we live now, we were recommended not to neuter him until well after a year, if at all. Intact dogs are extremely common for a myriad of reasons - the communication culture here is different, for one. People always ask the gender and castration situation of my dog before allowing theirs to play. Also because it's such a dense and dangerous city, dogs are trained to the point of never leaving their owners side for anything so they won't stray into traffic, or they never end up off leash at all if they can't be trained to that level, so the risk of these dogs bolting for a potential mate seems extremely low.

That being said, we come from a country where an intact dog is rare to see. I was raised with the mantra to spay and neuter always, and usually anywhere between 8 weeks to ten months, with the benefits cited regularly and the culture being that keeping an animal intact is irresponsible dog ownership. I actually had to fight that initial impulsive judgment when I first moved here, every time I saw an adult dog that wasn't neutered. I feel now that my bias was based off a lack of information about the dogs I saw. I never knew their history or level of training and admittedly, I was running off the public opinions of my home country. 

I've hunted for myriads of articles saying yea or nay to early neutering and have comes across SO MANY CONFLICTING STUDIES with sooooo many varying opinions on when to spay or neuter if at all. I try to look at who funds these studies, primarily, but I'm becoming overwhelmed!

Any stories to share, tips to give or discussion would be supremely helpful. You all love your dogs and I don't doubt you've thought hard about the options for your babies. Indy, for all his quirks, is a piece of my heart and I want to make the most informed decision I can on this. He's nine months old now and we can't decide what to do or when to do it.

Thanks in advance!"	dogs
784	[Discussion] Can we all agree that even though you love dogs, it doesn't mean you're set to be a dog owner?	"I posted earlier this month about my SIL who's dog bolted when the front door was opened, and unfortunately he got run over because he likes chasing cars. Well... she was taking care of her brother's small maltese dog and he fell out of her SUV on the freeway.

&amp;#x200B;

WTF, right? Two dogs, one unfortunately passed and the other is in critical condition. I straight out told her that she does not know how to care for pets, specifically dogs. I told her to not get another dog until she's well read in caring for one. I'm so frustrated and mad. The dog is currently in the SD Humane Society as they're conducting an investigation. These poor dogs, it's not their fault at all. Just because you love dogs and think they're cute doesn't mean you're cut out to be a dog parent. They're a huge responsibility.  Gah, just needed to get this off my chest. But it's true isn't it? With holiday season coming up, all these people are going to think its cute to gift puppies, kittens, small animals, and in a month or two they'll notice that they're not cut out for this and return them or throw them to the streets. The lucky ones will end up in a shelter. It's just idk, I'm just overwhelmed :/

tl;dr: SIL hurt second dog in a month and I'm furious with her stupidity.

785	[Fluff] My Dog Didn't Leave the Yard!	"So Stanley had run from my brother and I before when he's been off leash. I have never trusted him to be off leash in the backyard since it is only fenced in on three sides. 

But Last night, he slipped his leash while going to the backyard and ran around the yard. When he was done, he went and sat in the spot he usually sits in for me to switch the leashes. He then followed me back to the front door (since we have a wasps nest in our backdoor). Yeah, he got treats."	dogs
786	My dog has started peeing in the house. [Help]	"Hi there.


My dog’s information before we begin:


Age - 6


Country - UK


Breed - Greyhound 


Sex - Male


He is Castrated


Dogs weight - unsure


Food? How much? How many times a dog? And what food - In the morning he has gravy bones and bone marrow biscuits. He eats dinner at around 6:30pm which is a mix of dry biscuits soaked in warm water, and wet meat product. (I can get the brands if needed). He has a Pedigree Dentastix once a day as well as a couple various other small treats.


He is not suffering from any ailment /that we know of/.


What is happening:
We rescued our dog about 2 and 1/2 years ago. He’s always had problems messing in the house, the rescue said he was house trained before he came to us but we think this was a lie, he did not know how to ask for the toilet, and we practically had to train him from scratch to go outside. We know he lived in kennels for most of his life before he came to us, with 6 months in a foster home.

Since he has settled with us the fouling in the house has gotten much better and is now very infrequent, and we can see what triggers him - when he is left alone in the house we will come back to a poop, so it is probably separation anxiety which is understandable.

What we don’t understand however is a new problem with peeing. Three times in the last month he will pee on the floor in front of us or when we are in the room with him, for no obvious reason. It is not a little spray, he will release a full bladder of pee. Today was the last straw where he peed on his own bed - which makes me worried there’s a problem with him as this seems unusual? We let him out often during the day to relieve himself and walk him in the evening where he will poop and pee also. Does anyone have any ideas why he is just letting go in front of us like this all of a sudden? Does he need vet attention?


(One thing I should maybe mention is that we have a family of foxes that often defecate in our garden. Not sure if this would affect his pee habits?)

787	Brothers golden and my golden keep fighting, any tips to stop them? [discussion]	So they are both 7 months old and 2 weeks apart. My brothers dog is older. They have known each other for about 6 months now but only see each other maybe once a month. This week we had to watch my brothers dog cause he went on vacation. The first day they got into a fight but it was real quick and both stopped as soon as me and my brother stepped in. But every morning my dog who sleeps upstairs would come down and my brothers dog would be very aggressive and try and attack him but I would prevent it and put them both outside and they would play and run like they are bffs. Last night they got into a huge fight out of nowhere and I couldn’t stop them. They just kept going at it no matter what I did. Even my mom was trying to help and I ended up pulling my brothers do by the tail because he kept trying to go after my dog. Finally got them separated and realized my brothers dog was bleeding by his mouth. Looked like my dog really got him good in the fight, but not bad enough that required any trip to the vet. My brother plans on getting his dog fixed as he’s insanely hyper and barely ever stops running or playing. Hopefully that helps because he starts all the fights. My dog is calm and likes to sleep all day lol. I honestly didn’t think they would fight this week cause they have been together for a whole week and finally got to know each other. I’m worried that they might fight again today but I won’t be home so hopefully my mom just keeps them separate or can control that wild beast my brother has. 	dogs

790	[Help] Puppy is very underweight, breeder might have gotten rid of him early	"I took my male German Shepherd tot he vet, and he weighed about 10lbs at 8 weeks. Half or two thirds of what he should be at this age. He looks chubby, in any case not malnourished.

Either my puppy is going to be very small or the breeder got rid of the puppy earlier than he should have. Puppy  also seems younger than 8 weeks, ""chubby and not very coordinated"" rather than ""miniature German Shepherd"".

Either way, it is what it is. 

I don't mind a slightly smaller German Shepherd. I am not planning to sell him to the Chinese restaurant down the street, I just need him big enough to deter the occasional crackhead and anything extra just makes him more likely to have hip trouble. 

What concerns me most is how the vaccination schedule is impacted. How can I figure out the real age so that I vaccinate him at the correct age?

791	[Discussion] Heavy. When did you know it was time to let them go?	"I guess this could also go with the help and the rant tag. I dunno... This is gonna be a novel of a post, though, and mostly I guess I just need to rant and get some advice...

I am in the middle of a heavy dilemma.  I have a 14 year old Shih Tzu. Had her since I was 15... She is deaf, 75% blind, and struggles with doggie dementia. 

She used to be a this tough, brave little brat, who gave no shits about life, wasnt scared of the devil himself, and loved to run and play. I *adore* her. I've had her since she was just a wee puppy rescue and she's been through everything with me. I am her doggie equivalent of a soul mate. 

However, these last two years have been nothing but a struggle with her.

She developed dementia after having an eye-skin graft and losing most of her sight. It's a long traumatic story, but basically a groomer clipped her eye and she needed surgery from it. We tried to save the eyeball and her sight, but she still lost her sight. 

She's been in diapers for the last two years because of the dementia (all her potty training went out the fucking window). Which is flat hellish in itself. 

On top, she's always had separation anxiety, but it's gotten 1000x worse in the last several months. Like, going from usual casual barking to full on ""you're killing me"" screeches--from just being anywhere alone... I can't take her to work (she wont settle down), but I also can't leave her at home. My mom takes care of her while I'm at work, but my girl can be a handful and is frustrating for her.

The biggest thing is that at night, sometimes it's like I'm the boogy man when it's time to go to bed. She runs and trembles and acts like she doesn't know me. She acts like I'm going to beat her when I am just trying to catch her to put her on the bed to sleep with me. She's always slept in the bed with me. When I don't corner her, and just leave her be in her scared state, she paces. All. Night. Long. Those nights, I get zero sleep.

Other nights and days, she is herself--loving, cuddly,  pressing her little forehead against my hand for scratchies, wanting to be under my feet/covers. Sometime she even plays for a hot second and actually wags her tail!! I love and live for those moments again, but sometimes they seem so far and few between.

I am heart broken. She doesn't enjoy car rides any more (cries almost the whole time), and sleeps like 23hrs a day. Some days she is so aloof and just stares at the walls or ceiling and doesn't care to interact and if you try to engage her, she just groans and walks away/lays down.

She is so stiff in the mornings and her hips give out if she stands up for too long. She can't jump (old play injury from another dog) and managing stairs is next to impossible. We had to build her a ramp to go pee outside.

Now, all this physical stiffness stuff I expected. Normal old dog woes from a wonderful life, right? But the psychological is tripping me up.

The vet can't seem to find anything physically wrong and gave me hella expensive meds for her--but they aren't working.

I know it's time. Her quality of life has been and is diminishing fast. I dont want to do it out of anger or sleep deprivation. I want to be okay about it. But every time I get the courage up to call to have the vet come to my house, my old woman begs for cuddles with those blind eyes and tongue hanging out, and gives those kisses that are so few these days... and my heart just sobs.

This is so hard and I loathe that I have to play god. How does anyone manage it? "	dogs
792	[Help] I May have to take ownership of a ten year old lab in a day or two, and could use advice.	"It happened very sudden. However, upon coming home from work today, it was shared to me by my partner that a friend's girlfriend's 10 year old lab will most likely have to go to a shelter, if they can not find anyone to take him in. Without really considering the full weight of my words, I quickly volunteered to take in the good old boy if it comes down to him having to go to a shelter. 

I suppose it may have to come down to a shelter, for he has to be gone by this weekend. So now I am committed to taking in this senior, it most likely seems, and soon. He is coming over tomorrow to mingle with my current dog to see how well they interact. As far as I know, I am the only person who has offered.

I could really use advice on how I should go about this, because it seems like it could be a bit of a headache. The Labrador is a well trained, lovable dude who is good with infants and kids. Him being given up has nothing to do with him, personally (dogally??). My current guy is a year and a half year old German/Australian shepherd mix, who is very playful, with an abundance of energy. He's pretty good with other dogs, but I don't think he has had much interactions with senior dogs. He is, though, a very devoted dog to me and my girlfriend. I am worried my current dog, being  energetic and still young, may be too intense for a senior. But, I can't let a dog who has been so loved by his owner for a decade be abandoned to a shelter. If you guys have any advice to share on how I can make this work, if at all, it would mean a lot! 

Thank you all!

I own a 2 bedroom and 2 story house with a decent sized backyard. I also have an abundance of trails and old jeep roads in the woods where I go on frequent walks with my current dog.

795	[Help] About to become dog-parents due to dog-parent loss	"My sister has terminal cancer and has asked us (me, husband and kids) to take her beautiful husky-mix, Mira, when she passes. Mira turned 3 last May. She’s a sweet dog and great with my kids (and they love her). We’ve watched Mira many times due to my sister’s illness, and she’s always excited when she first gets here, then becomes despondent because she misses her mom/home.

We all think we’re doing the right thing for Mira by allowing her to get comfortable here little by little, but once despondency sets in, she never seems to snap out of it until she sees my sister. I’m a little worried about her when she comes here for good. Does anyone have any experience with dog-parent loss and what we can expect?

A little background, my husband and I both grew up with dogs, but we haven’t had one together (we hadn’t  felt like it was ever really the right time for us due to kids, finances, etc.). We did have a roommate for 2.5 yrs who had dogs, and we dog-sat regularly while our roommate traveled for work. We also dog-sat long-term for a military friend who is back home and happy with his pup.

Based on our past experiences we feel that we’re ready for Mira because we and love her and feel prepared to take on a sweet, well-taken care of pup.

796	[Help] GSD pacing behavior	Looking for advice on how to deal my dogs behavior. I have an almost 2 year old GSD. She is spayed and we've had her since she was 9 weeks old. We have had some issues with separation anxiety in the past. She was stressed and destructive every time we left the house. We dealt with this by increasing exercise time, long lasting chew toys like bully sticks and frozen kongs, and a thunder shirt. We luckily got through it and she's an angel when we leave now. However, she has developed a new behavior of sniffing the ground and pacing. I'm unsure what starts this behavior. She does it if we are up and moving around like when cleaning the house or if we are sitting down and move too quickly. It is worse if their are guests at our house, even if she knows them very well. We thought with a consistent routine and increasing exercise this would subside but it has not. I'm wondering if this is almost like an anxiety related compulsion? Would anxiety medication be appropriate?  Any suggestions would be appreciated! 	dogs

Pictures show missing gum and exposed jawbone.

Is this going to heal on its own? I have no idea. It looks just terrible. He is 2.5 years old, weighs 96 pounds. He was hurting for a while, I was spoon feeding him. He has his appetite back and can chew, he is eating/drinking/peeing/pooping and seems upbeat but you can tell he is hurting some.

When indoors he keeps his mouth closed and completely covers the wound with lip, and there is a lot of clear running drool. Outside he pants because of the heat and you can see it.

I can't afford major surgery for this guy. Does something that looks like this ever get better on its own?

He is also missing a big chunk of tongue, the rest of it is working ok but still sore.

I am really fond of this dog but I'm not going to be able to spend thousands of dollars on him, and I don't want him to go downhill ... it would be swell if he could get through this. Anyone have an opinion?"	dogs

799	[Help] My food obsessed dog is getting worse	"I have two adopted dogs, 4-5 years of age, both mixes. I noticed over the last few weeks that my one, Vita, has been getting aggressive at feeding time and seems to be always seeking out food.

He is far from the dominant of my two, but at meal time, he tries to bully the other, Luna, away from her food. If I step away, he'll steal her food and try to eat both bowls. I used to feed them right next to each other and I've had to start feeding them across the room and supervise them until she's done. Tonight, he actually growled and did something (my error, but I walked around the corner for literally a split second) and actually drew a little blood.

When he's not being fed, I'll watch him walk around looking for food. He'll walk around the kitchen (but won't go in because he's not allowed) and will sniff around the countertops/bar looking for something. 

He'll eat cat food if it's left out or if he even hears the cats knock it down (no more cats, but that was a recent move).

He will do literally anything for food. It's great for training and I can get his attention off anything with food but otherwise it's not so great. He will steal food the second he knows you're not paying attention. He's smart, so he watches and waits and then moves in. By looking at him, you wouldn't even think he's paying attention to you, but he is.

Every once in a while, he'll steal food right out of your hand, even when it's on the way to your mouth. This one is rare and pretty confusing because he doesn't actually even ""beg"" per se, but it happens occasionally.

I've had dogs all my life, and I know they like food, but this is something else and it's only getting worse. I don't give them scraps often and if I do, it's never from the food I'm actively eating. Most of the time it goes in their bowls anyway. They don't get to eat the scraps off the ground. I don't know what's going on here, I'm pretty lost."	dogs
800	[Vent] My parters mum is giving her dog to the person who stole it.	"My boyfriends mother is wanting to give her dog to the person who stole him, since she doesn’t want him anymore because she “can’t handle” having two dogs. 

Back story: They had a flat mate (whom is also a family member of theirs) who stole their dog when she got kicked out of the house for stealing their valuables. It took us 2-3 months to get him back, since she lied to us and the police about not having him. But then was dumb enough to want to have a doggy play date once my partners mum got a new puppy. And then we took him back and told her to piss off and buy her own dog. 

I’m so pissed at this situation. She doesn’t want the dog because to her he’s too much of a “sook” and a “pussy” just cause he likes to follow you around and to watch what your doing and likes to be near you and get cuddles. Then she also makes excuses saying he’s going to be aggressive when he’s older just because she thought he was a “pitbull” since he looked like one cause of his “red nose” which he isn’t and is mixed with two different mastiff breeds (also I should note that he never showed any signs of aggression) she then starts calling him a “sook” and stuff.
Yet her other dog that she adores so much shows aggression and bites us hard when playing with him and also when he’s eating a bone he growls and snaps when the other dog gets near him, yet the other one that she wants to give away doesn’t do any of that. But she won’t listen to my boyfriend or I cause apparently we don’t know anything about how these dogs act. But we’re the ones who have the dogs near us all the time.

And what’s more frustrating is that she wants to give the dog away to the person who stole him, since they’re on good terms now?? And it’s like wtf. She’s just showing that person that it’s OK to steal someone’s dog and that’s it doesn’t even matter. Also the person doesn’t even know how to look after a dog and can’t even afford to keep one nor able to afford to look after herself. 
And my boyfriends mum won’t think to keep even keep the dog for another month so he can go to a good home where he will be properly looked after, since my friend can’t take him until the end of November. But i can’t even talk to her about it since me trying to talk sense into her will just be complaining, since it’s not my dog and I don’t look after him, so I have no say.

801	[Discussion] Laundry/shedding tips?	"I’m looking for ways to deal with dog fur in the laundry that don’t involve using massive amounts of lint rollers. I brush her, and give her biweekly baths, but, of course, she still sheds. I have hardwood floors, so my apartment looks furry if I don’t vacuum for more than a day. She is a single coated mutt, for reference.

Do dryer balls do anything? I mean the kind with little protrusions on them, not the plain round ones. I sort of feel like there’s something that can be done in the dryer so the fur gets trapped in the lint trap. I’ve started wearing slippers at home so my socks don’t pick up as much fur. Still wondering if there’s anything better than vacuuming for the furniture or her bed, too.

Any other thoughts?"	dogs

805	[help] need something to put over a slatted porch so my dogs don’t give my neighbor a golden shower	"I’m moving into a new apartment with my dogs, second floor. Our current apartment is in a high rise but had a concrete balcony. We currently employ a sod box but occasionally one of the dogs would miss or decide arbitrarily that day they would relieve themselves on the concrete instead. 

The new apartment has a wood slatted balcony, and I’d like to figure out some sort of fail safe to cover the balcony with so it doesn’t rain down on my neighbor if an accident happens. This would also be great for spilled drinks, watering plants, etc. 

I was thinking some kind of tongue and groove removable tile? That I could hopefully wipe down and mop? Would it just go through the cracks in that? 

Another question, there are plenty of threads on this topic but they’re all pretty old. 
Has anybody figured out a way to keep the smell down on a sod box? Or figured out a new way to do a porch potty? Before it was on the back balcony so a little smell now and then didn’t matter, now it’s going to be right outside our front door and all our guests are going to have to walk past it. 

Before everybody jumps on me, they get walked two to three times a day between me and my partners work schedules, they get brought out to relieve themselves, this isn’t the primary bathroom option. "	dogs
806	[Help] How to get my dog to eat a bland diet	Went to the emergency vet tonight because after leaving daycare my sweet girl was eating a ton of grass, and had loose stools with some bright red blood. Vet thinks it's just regular GI distress and will be running a panel on the stool sample to be sure, but wasn't concerned about a blockage or something more serious. But they sent us home with wet food for a bland diet which she has never had before. She is a sort of picky eater in general and takes her awhile to decide new foods or treats are worth eating. She hasn't eaten all day and has had diarrhea and is now sitting in front of the cabinet where her normal food is kept and crying, so I am 90% sure she is hungry she just doesn't want something unfamiliar. We also had to put it in a different food dish. It is one she has used before for treats and food but her regular meal dish is a puzzle feeder that doesn't lend its self to wet food. Any suggestions on how to get her to try the new food? I sprinkled a tiny bit of her regular kibble over the top hoping that would make it familiar enough to at least try it but no such luck.	dogs

811	[discussion] phenobarb.. epilepsy.. pharmacist switching drugs.. ugh	"hey guys. my 2 yr old 120lb cane corso mix was put on phenobarbital for his grand mal seizures a little over a month ago. today, he had ab 5 seizures back to back for the first time since starting the meds. literally all within 2 min of each other. thankfully my roommate was home and able to rush him to the vet for me. 

anyways.. my vet wasn’t there so i spoke to another over the phone who basically told me to put my dog down and i later was told by my roommate that the vet was suggesting this idea to her as well. what the fuck? i’ve seen at least 3 vets for their opinions on my dog and never have i been told he should be put down. that’s not even the point of this post that was just a little rant for your entertainment.

when it came time i had a really difficult time getting my pharmacist to fill his new script.. it took over a week.. ridiculous. when i got the new pills i noticed something was different but i couldn’t quite put my tongue on it bc i had nothing to compare to as i had already run out of his og script. i had my vet FT me to show me the phenobarb they were giving my dog there AND ITS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from what my fucking pharmacist gave me. so first thing i did was hit the inter webs, obviously. APPARENTLY phenobarbital is one of the four of allllll the anti seizure medications that SPECIFICALLY says it could cause breakthrough seizures if the brand you’re using were swapped out for some other generic brand. AND ITS TOTALLY LEGAL FOR YOUR PHARMACIST TO MAKE THIS CHANGE WITHOUT EVEN MENTIONING IT. this honestly isn’t even a discussion i just needed to rant and allow feedback to make sure i’m not crazy for being upset that this is a thing. i don’t really know what to do from here bc it’s $30 to fill it at a pharmacy and $110 to fill it at my vet.. gr8. i hope this is the cause for the most recent seizures and i hope there’s an easy solution bc i don’t know what to do if he keeps having them bc dropping 2k last month and $350 today is really putting a damper on my savings. anybody else have epilepsy experiences to share? this is my first dog w epilepsy so i’m still new to it. pretty frustrating that every vet says “basically the definition of epilepsy is we have no fuckin idea what’s wrong so here’s a drug to sedate your dog to stop the seizures” ((((: "	dogs
812	[DISCUSSION] We are sending our newly adopted puppy back to the rescue and I feel like a horrible person	"My partner and I had the wonderful experience of finding what we thought was the sweetest little dog at a shelter an hour or so away. We were excited, as the shelter swore up and down that he was good with cats, which was a huge deal for us as we have a very docile cat who never cries or anything. We adopted him last week, and he's just so sweet. 

But he has repeatedly tried to kill our cat. We've tried a few things over the week, and tried to introduce them slowly, but he lunges at the cat and goes immediately for the throat. Twice we've had to physically pry him off because he grips and tries to shake the cat violently. Our poor little kitty is stressed, and is scared to leave our bedroom because of the dog. Behavioral therapies would cost upwards of 800 dollars, which  my partner and I don't have the means to do right now. 

I just feel like a piece of shit person, to be honest. I feel like I've failed in trying to give this little life a home. I just hope that he finds a good home, and I've just been sobbing nonstop because we have to give him up."	dogs
813	[Help]My Great Pyrenees lunged and snarled/snapped at my father-in-law	"  

My husband and I adopted a 3 year old Great Pyrenees (Odin) about 3 months ago. Ever since we brought him home, he has been nothing but a good boy. He is very calm, only barks when other animals come around, and loves to be pet. We take him on 30 minutes walks twice a day and he is let out to run around in our large front yard multiple time a day. He’s such a love bug and a goof! We have been socializing him on walks as much as we can and try to have people come over as much as possible so we can show him that company are good people. My father-in-law comes over once a week to help my husband with house repairs, yard work, or anything to do with home improvements. When my FIL comes over, he spends some time petting Odin and giving him some love. Odin loves it! Unfortunately, this morning, my FIL was giving Odin some pets (he was sitting in a chair and petting Odin’s head, neck, and chest) and Odin lunged and snarled at my FIL while I was sitting not 5 feet from them! I immediately shouted “no” and got Odin on the ground. I then took him into our bedroom and shut the door while I told my husband what happened. My FIL wasn’t hurt, but understandably startled. Odin has NEVER shown any signs of aggression towards anyone before, especially my FIL who is here all the time. What would be the reason that Odin would act this way? Should I take him to the vet to get checked? He shows no signs of injury or illness, but I can’t find a reason for him to be aggressive."	dogs
814	[Vent] solicitors telling me to control my dog.	"So I like having the blinds open while it’s still light out and I was off today so I had them open as usual and the dog and cat like to look outside so it’s for them as well. Because the blinds were open and I was in the living room I saw two ladies walking up my drive way with stuff in their hands.... basically, soliciting. It appeared it had to do with church/religion because of their attire. 

My not quite 2 year old Australian Shepherd is on the larger side for his height/length. If someone is in our front yard hat he doesn’t know he goes crazy barking at them at the window. I figured I might as well sneak out the front door to basically tell them I’m not interested in whatever they’re selling/offering/preaching (and point out the fact that it says no soliciting right by my front door on the mail box). Well Loki (my dog) moves super fast and is working his way through the door as I’m opening up so I’m trying to pull him back into the house so I can shimmy out. Unfortunately he doesn’t listen to me very well, he listens to my husband a lot better and to get him to listen I need to make my voice kind of deep. 

These two lady’s literally yell at him “DON’T LET HIM OUT!!!”, and I’m holding my dog back and trying to get him in the house and then they yell “JUST SHUT THE DOOR!!” I am holding him my arms at this point and said “I’m literally trying....” then they yelled “We’ll just come back another time” not quite as loud as they did the other things. I slammed the door behind me as I got the dog inside. 

Now I know damn well I’m the irresponsible one for having a dog that is trying to get out so bad, his barking is intimidating and I know that, but really he just wants to greet whoever is here which means he wants to jump on them and get petted which I know is not good either. I’m honestly not trying to condone my dogs bad behavior or my bad dog parenting but how the fuck are these bitches going to come up to my house and start telling me what to do with my own dog on my own damn property that literally says no soliciting. Ugh! The people then decided to sit with their car partially on my front yard while they knocked on near by houses and the other car of their associates or whatever came by for about 5 min. Of course my dog is still barking in the window and usually I would stop him but I really didn’t want them coming back so I just let it happen. 

I don’t even know the purpose of my post I guess I just wanted to get it out. 

On a side note, “Beware of dog” signs, does anyone have them? I’m going to get one to put on our fence that can seem from one side of the house.

819	[Help] Adult dog peeing/pooping in the house even after going out	"My wife and I have a 5 year old pug that I got three years ago from a couple that was moving out of the country. His previous owners lived in an apartment and trained him using pee pads instead of walking him outside. I've struggled to get him consistently house trained ever since owning him. When I walk him, he'll almost always pee but sometimes won't poop. Often, not long after going out, I'll find poop/pee somewhere in the house as soon as he moves out of sight. My wife calls him the ""poop ninja"" because it seems like all it takes is for him to move out of your sight for a second and there it is. He likes to go on things that may be left in the floor, like a shirt that falls out of the hamper or our bath mat, when we forget to keep the bathroom door closed. I assume this is because of his previous training to use pads. We put him in his crate while we're not home and when we're eating or otherwise unable to watch him. Even when I'm hanging out with him while I'm on my computer or playing games, I have to be constantly vigilant for when he gets up to leave the room. All it takes is for me to get absorbed in what I'm doing and not be paying attention to him for a minute and he's left the room and messed in the house. Sometimes I'll be playing a game online and he'll leave the room to get water and I'll be calling him back because I'm playing live and can't go watch him and I feel terrible calling him back when he's just going to the kitchen to get a drink of water, but the alternative is to just constantly keep him in his crate. He knows he's not supposed to go in the house and whenever I point to it and ask ""what is this?"" he looks guilty and goes and lays in his bed, but I feel like he has plenty of opportunity to go outside because my wife and I walk him 4-5 times a day on a schedule. I've researched and haven't quite found a resource that addresses our somewhat uncommon issue and I don't know what else to do at this point, I would appreciate any advice you can give. "	dogs

* I've got no preference; I love want a lovable buddy!

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-ish. As long as they're around 60-70 LBS, it would work for the apartment 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding minimum, but just a preference. I'd prefer them not to be vocal, as being in an apartment, I don't want to be 'that guy'. And slobber doesn't bother me

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'd be nice, growing up we'd take our dogs out weekly to the desert and let them run around with us. But it's definitely not a deal breaker

Outside of that, I normally don't go out, and if I do, it's only for a couple hours at a time. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

821	[Discussion] Socialize your puppies	"My #1 advice to new dog owners: please socialize your puppy. I can't stress how important this is. Take your pup to puppy socials, on short walks, dog park, to brunch, to dinner, to other people's houses, etc. My puppy got parvo when he was 8 weeks and our vet didn't let us take him outside or even in the backyard until he was 18 weeks and when we finally did he was so nervous and aggressive.

He lunged and barked at everything, people, other dogs, runners, mailmen, literally everything. At one point we were scared to take him out the house because it was so embarrassing and such a hassle but he's been so much better now and only barks when people try to pet him on the face head on. 

If you have a puppy or just got one, please just socialize him/her because it'll really work out in the long run. A socialized dog will be the happiest and non stressed dog. Most ""aggressive"" dogs are just unsocialized and afraid. "	dogs
822	[Vent] So fucking sick of judgemental dog owners	"We have a leash reactive puppy that’s currently healing from her spay surgery and is in the throes of adolescence. She gets extremely excited when she sees other dogs on walks and we’ve been leash training for months (even did reactive dog classes). There have been a lot of days lately that have been extremely frustrating and, to be honest, there are some days I don’t even like our dog. 

When our puppy reacts on leash it looks really scary sometimes and people have asked if she’s aggressive many times. However, I find it worse when it’s other dog owners that look at us with so much disdain in their eyes. We never let our dog do leash greetings and always keep our distance from any other dogs. We even walk at odd hours or really late. There are times where we’ve literally run away from another dog to avoid a reaction. 

There’s one particular Samoyed owner that glares at us and rolls his eyes at us when we run into him during walks. Every time we’ve seen this dog, we’ve bene unable to get our dog under her threshold (too close and have nowhere to run, lunging so much we can’t drag her away). It doesn’t help when the other owner is taking his sweet ass time walking by. I’m just done with this guy. I’ve told my husband that the next time he looks at us like that I’m gonna fucking scream. He acts like he’s the best fucking dog owner out there even when his own dog is whining and lunging at ours too.

EDIT: Thanks for the extra judgement guys. I guess I’m coming of overly sensitive, but having a reactive dog does that sometimes. Not everyones dog is a perfect “good boye”. "	dogs

824	[Help] Repeated diarrhea - what to do before we can see the vet?	"Hi All - so first off, I know the only correct answer here is “go to the vet,” we are doing that early next week. I’m looking for any possible causes and what we can be doing in the mean time. 

Last weekend we came home to nasty liquid diarrhea all over our bedroom after leaving our dog (3 year old Aussie mix) for a couple hours. We didn’t feed him dinner that night, and slowly introduced kibble back in the next morning. He acted totally normal throughout and started having normal poops. Cool, we thought it was just a random bug and he was fine now. Well, I came home today to the same situation. He’s acting totally normal, besides having liquid bowel movements. At this point I know it probably warrants a trip to the vet, and we will make an appointment as soon as we can early next week. 

Any ideas on what would be causing this? We did recently move into a new house, but that was several weeks ago, so it seems weird that any nervous reaction to that would be delayed this much. The first time the diarrhea thing happened last weekend, it was pretty quick after we got a new bag of dog food. We got the same brand we always get (merrick grain free), but got a different flavor, which is what we normally do. Could it just be a bad bag of dog food? We are almost always watching him when he is out in the yard - he tries to eat the grass sometimes, but we stop him fairly quickly and I haven’t put any chemical or fertilizers on the grass. I’m just at a loss for what it could be. 

I just think it’s odd that he had diarrhea, went back to normal for several days, and now the diarrhea happens again. Any tips on how to help him out this weekend before we see the vet would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you!!"	dogs
825	[Help] Does this breeder seem reputable?	"https://www.cloud9doodles.com/

I've recently been in contact with this breeder about possibly adopting a Sheepadoodle from their most recent litter. I know that there are some people that have problems with cross-breeds and 'designer dogs' and I am somewhat conscious of those concerns. Aside from that concern, are there any other red flags that I am missing from their website?

Also, when I asked about being able to visit the dogs and see them in person before deciding on a puppy, they said that they do not let people visit before the puppy's second round of shots, because of an outbreak of parvovirus that happened in our province? Is this itself a red flag? I did google around to see if there was reports on this outbreak, and there were several articles from around a year ago, and other more recent articles about outbreaks in neighboring provinces."	dogs
826	[Breeds] Seeking recommendations for a service dog	"**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I currently have a corgi and was raised with German shepherds

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would rather go with a breeder so I know the dog's entire background

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Large and stable-minded. I need a dog that will make me feel safe as I have PTSD and agoraphobia, and struggle to leave the house on my own. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Golden retrievers seem like a safe bet, but I'm admittedly more drawn to German shepherds because I feel safer with a protective breed. However, I've heard German shepherds are not the best bet for someone with anxiety as they can become hypervigilant and will make the person even more anxious. I would like the dog to be somewhat physically intimidating so I feel the dog is a deterrent to a potential threat, which is the only reason I'm hesitant with a golden.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Psychiatric service dog for PTSD, which is pretty complicated, so it needs to be a more intelligent breed.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I work from home, so I have many hours to devote to training and caring for my dog.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I'm a jogger, so moderate activity. I do not go to dog parks but am unwilling to have a dog-aggressive dog at the same time; I can't deal with any type of reactivity.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

827	[Help] My dog has bad posture	I have a six month old dog, and when he is just chillin on the couch he usually [sits like this.](http://imgur.com/a/TOZZdTu) It looks like something that would be bad for his spine and hips, but I was wondering if maybe it's normal for a dog? If not how do I teach him to stop sitting like that?	dogs
828	[Breeds] What dog Is right for me? Rescue? Breeder?	"**Introduction (Please note that I will not be getting a dog too soon. I have been doing my research and just want to learn more of what might be the ideal dog for me and do more study before anything happens. I really want to make a lasting relationship with my dog.)**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes on my own but I grew up with two different dogs

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I am open but have some questions/concerns. With a rescue, I do not have any idea of it's background and if it could have potential health issues later in life. I think I would be devastated if my dog didn't live atleast 9-10 years since I see owning a dog as a member of the family and bond extremely close with them. The pro of having a rescue is there is most likely a chance that the dog I would rescue is partially crate/house trained which makes some of the puppy stages of acclimating easier while working full time.

1. Describe your ideal dog.

A large-ish dog that I can play and do activities with. One that is friendly with other people and dogs. I would like to not have to be too on guard looking for the signals if he or she could turn aggressive because a child wants to pet my dog or if I take him or her to a dog park to play with others. I know a lot of this can be helped with training. I want an affectionate dog. It has always been a dream to have a loyal intelligent dog that can run off leash with me, go hiking, or play fetch without worrying if a squirrel or something else catches his or her attention and won't respond to my commands to come back or ignore the said stimuli. I would prefer a lower shedding breed if possible but would be open to working around a higher shedding dog if other traits are there. That is one particular trait that has me against Golden Retrievers.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Mixed, Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Weimaraners, Vizsla. I would like a dog that enjoys outdoor activities, but also one that is affectionate and can be relatively calm when at home. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Loose leash walking, running without a leash, sit, stay, to come when called, fetch, not jump on people that are strangers and aren't ready for it, and not bark whenever someone rings the door bell. 

**Care Commitments**

6.	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 30 minute walk in the morning, little play during lunch, and run with me after work for 1 to 1-1/2 hours plus additional house play before bed. 

7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Minimum 1-1/2 to 2 hours of walking/jogging. I do a bit of trail running and would like a trail running buddy. That could be around 5-7 miles 3 times a week if the dog is up for it. If not I don't mind running less if I can run with my dog. Yes I don't mind using a dog park for him or her to socialize with other dogs.

8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? Sure. I don't mind doing brushing once or twice a week if it helps keep tumble fur from accumulating too quickly.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	What size dog are you looking for? Large-ish. 40-80lbs

10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

Shedding? Medium. A friend had a chow mix and I could fill half of a milk crate with fur and I felt like I wasn't done brushing him still.

Barking? Low. 

Slobber? lowish

11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? High

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? Snuggles. 

13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? Eager to please (but low separation anxiety if possible. I have experienced that and I felt terrible for the ol' girl)

14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? I don't mind the dog wanting to come to the door to see who it is and waggle it's tail, but I don't want barking or to scare visitors.

15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? No, I would try my best to socialize the dog with other dogs while young if possible. 

16.	Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? I don't know if I have the time ability to care for a dog that has had terrible trauma growing up and needs continuous attention or is too timid and could have some reactivity. 

**Lifestyle**

17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone? When the time comes for me to get a dog, I would hopefully be able to come home for lunch and let him or her out to play. So perhaps \~5 hours longest. Possibly if I couldn't get home from work maybe 8 hours? I assume I would request a dog walker then. 

18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? I'm living alone. But if someone were to come into the picture they would have to love my dog and I would not rely on them to take care of the dog but perhaps take it for a walk in the evening if she gets home before me.

19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? No

21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? I plan to rent in the future. 

22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? Just outside of Philly. No I am not aware I will do some research though.

23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? Average summer is 80-90F. Winter is 30-40

**Additional Information and Questions**

24.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

This will be my first time selecting and fully caring for a dog completely on my own. Although I grew up with dogs with my parents and brother, I do not feel they took care and responsibility for the dogs as I would have. And having too many cooks in the kitchen did not allow the level of training that I would have. Also the breeds were smaller dogs that I would not have chosen (Miniature Pinscher and Papillon)

25.	Feel free to ask any questions below.

\-I don't mind rescuing a dog but how can I know if it has any health issues or could likely develop health issues? The idea of a responsible breeder having genetic testing to know if a dog is likely to have issues such as a lab/golden having hip dysplasia, knee issues, eye issues, is a real plus to me. 

\- There seems to be a very vocal group of people who say to not get mixed breeds from breeders due to less caring breeders. Is there at all breeders that are very caring of what they do and try to produce healthy mixed pups? The only actual breeder mixes I would maybe consider are Golden Retriever/Lab, Lab/Poodle, Golden/Poodle. 

\-How do I discern a good breeder from a bad breeder? What questions should I ask? Is it uncommon to ask if they have had and can provide proof of genetic testing of the parent dogs?

831	[Breeds] Help my wife and I pick the right breed!	"
Hi guys. My wife and I are in our mid 30's and looking at moving to Cincinnati, Ohio for a job. Shortly after we settle down, we want to add a dog to our family, as we've been wanting a dog for a very long time.

1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I've raised 2 mini long-haired daschunds and my wife has raised a Thai Bangkaew. However, both of those were more family/parents' responsibilities. Recently, we've helped raise a labradoodle puppy to 8 months of age. While this is my mother's dog, we've been extremely involved in all training and exercise needs, as my mom had to get some unexpected surgery almost immediately after buying the dog. My mom has since recovered from her surgery and is now taking part in the dog as well.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

We prefer to go through a reputable breeder primarily because we want to raise it from puppyhood to be friendly with our cat, and second, we'd like some level of personality predictability based on the breed and meeting the dog's parents. We're both volunteers at the local animal shelter, so we feel we still do our part to give back, even if we don't adopt.

3) Describe your ideal dog.

High trainability, decent ""off switch"" given appropriate exercise, a running buddy, and an effective guard dog for my wife. The guard dog part has only recently become an issue as I've just gotten a job offer that's going to require me to travel quite often. Normally my wife and I jog together, but now she wants a dog that she can jog with when I'm gone that will at the very least scare off people with bad motives.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Prior to wanting a guard dog specifically, we were mostly interested in Australian shepherds, rough collies, and border collies. That said, we've never pulled the trigger because of exercise concerns. We're a really active couple, but we've just heard so many extreme stories about how much exercise Aussies and border collies need. As for why we like these, we both seem very attractive to the herding dog looks, size, and trainability. We've also looked at duck tollers for similar reasons.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Jogging, frisbee catching or fetching, obedience, and fun tricks.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

An hour or two

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Split between us, at least an hour regularly with some much longer days when we're both off. Types of exercise include walking, jogging, and fetch/frisbee. As for dog parks, I haven't accepted the job offer yet, but it does appear that there are several nearby dog parks.

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

My wife loves brushing my mother's labradoodle. We'd likely pay a professional for hair trimming and ear cleaning.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large


10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

We don't care much about shedding. We already can't wear dark colors because of our cat. A certain level of barking is both expected and good. We want the dog to alert us if someone is on our property. However, my mom's labradoodle is a huge demand barker, and we have no idea how to handle it. We certainly don't enjoy it. Slobbering is a big no for my wife.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

We do hike, so this would be a really nice perk. Not a priority though.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

All the snuggles all the time

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Bark to alert us but hopefully be trainable to stop barking once told. Standoff-ish with strangers is probably preferable for playing the role of a guard dog, as long as they're friendly once they read our body language.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression towards our cat.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

At least one of will be home 3 days per week. I'm expecting both of to be gone 8-9 hours per day during work days. We're planning to use doggy daycares and dog walkers to help with this.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

It's just my me and my wife. We're not planning to have any kids.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

We have a cat. We want one more cat in future and possibly another dog, though we're in no rush for this.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Rent. Unknown breed restrictions since I haven't accepted the job yet and we haven't moved.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

If I accept, Cincinnati, Ohio. I have not yet researched any breed laws.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

It's apparently pretty swingy in Cincinnati. Hot summers, cold winters.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

We're really not a fan of wire-haired or curly-haired breeds. We love my mom's labradoodle, but she looks more like a giant teddy bear than a dog.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

So I guess really what we want to know is, based on our answers, is an Aussie or collie a good fit? Is the level of exercise we've described enough for them, and even if it is, do they make okay guard dogs? If not, what other breeds do you recommend? Thanks!

832	[Help] What flea and tick prevention do you use and why?	I have been using K9 Advantix for my shihtzus (approx. 12 lbs each) because I was told it kills AND prevents flea and ticks, but the last time I used it it caused one of my dogs distress. She was super itchy and would whine and growl, jump up and bite her skin, etc. She would do this all night and nothing would give her relief. It has been about a month since I used it on her and she's still itchy, despite multiple baths with aloe and oatmeal medicated shampoo. Her itching not as bad but definitely noticeable. I'm about to get them both groomed and I would like to start them on new flea and tick prevention but I have no idea what to use. My mom told me flea collars used to make her dog sick but I'm afraid topicals are too much for my dog's sensitive skin. Any advice, suggestions, etc. would be most helpful! Thank you fellow dog lovers. &lt;3	dogs
833	[HELP] The dog I adopted might belong to someone else	"Hi everyone, I'm really at a loss for what to do about this.  About a month ago, my husband and I adopted a sweet, adorable adult dog from an animal shelter that my friend works at.  She had been found wandering the streets and though she had some injuries to her feet, her general health/ appearance/ demeanor all suggested that she had been owned by someone rather than living as a stray.  I felt a little bad thinking about whoever had previously owned her and if they missed her/ wanted her back, but I just figured that's how it is sometimes.  When we adopted her, the shelter had already had her for about 3 weeks and no one had come forward to claim her.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, for some reason, I decided to google search ""lost dog \[name of town where she was found\].""  I guess I thought I might find some new information about her.  What I did find was several facebook posts to lost pet communities from back in July with a picture that looks just like her, and from the next town over from where she was found.  I honestly felt my heart skip a beat.  I am 99% sure that this is the dog I adopted, and someone is out there looking for her (or at least they were a month and a half ago).  

&amp;#x200B;

Do I owe it to this person to contact them/ give back the dog?  Legally, the dog is mine.  And not to judge who is a good/ bad owner, but the dog was not wearing a collar, not spayed, not microchipped.  The dog was found one town over from where she was lost, a few days after being lost, and yet this owner for some reason did not reclaim the dog.  Also, I fucking love this dog.  I know I haven't had her for that long, but I would be devastated to have to give her up.  We live in another state from where we adopted her from, so there's no way that the previous owner would ever find her if I don't reach out to them.  From a purely ethical standpoint, I should probably give the dog back (or at least give the owner the option of getting the dog back).  But for my own peace of mind, should I just forget I ever saw this?"	dogs
834	[HELP][pug pekinese mix] took my 15 year old pup to the vet, fluid on his lungs	I was away on vacation, come back to find my dog with another bad skin infection.

Then he said he found fluid in his lungs, which is $300 to drain....we have all the meds and things for his skin infection, and got him his arthritis medication. My question is about the fluid in his lungs. If we have that drained, will it just come right back again?

837	[Help] Regarding meal time with my 2 pups	"Hello y'all, I'm just having a little difficulty getting and understanding why my puppies don't eat when I put down there food. I have two pups, one is a 2 year old and the other is a 1 year. I recently went on vacation and left them with dog sitters, the sitter let me know my 2 year old got into the habit of eating dry food along with his wet food. So I picked them up around 3 days ago and restocked on their foods and treats. Well I've given them food every morning (around 7:30/8 am) and when I get home for lunch they still haven't touched the food. I proceed to throw out the morning food because it's dry and looks old and give them their lunch, but my 1 year old is the only one that eats it. My 2 year old will go up to it, smell it, then walk away. I don't understand why they aren't eating in the morning and why my 2 year old won't eat his food. When I'm eating my food he's always looking up at me so I know for a fact he *is* hungry but I take him to his plate where *his* food is at and he doesn't eat it, like I said he just walks away and I don't feed him my food so I'm kinda worried he's starving. Anybody got any advice or tips on this? And also, regarding the morning food, do I just skip that, since they haven't ate in the morning, and just give them lunch?  

Thank you in advance, and I apologize for the way this was written lol.

838	[help]* 9.5 pupper presents with bumps	"Hello everyone, 
My childhood doggo recently came to live with me after graduation from college. He’s been on a strict diet, he’s had bad hips and my parents chronically over fed him. He’s lost 13 pounds so far (100-&gt; 87) which, considering he’s a medium English lab with arthritis, he’s much happier.  I’ve noticed a lump on the side of his trunk has gotten bigger. Now, he’s had little bumps that are loose under the skin, you can move them around and whatnot without hurting him. Other vets, namely the one that’s seen him since he was a pup say they’re just fatty benign lipomas. 

Yesterday I took woofus to the vet for a checkup because the lump on his side has gotten bigger. Vet took a needle aspiration of that lump on his side. Vet said the sample she took was inconclusive and she’s recommending a removal so she can take a biopsy to determine what it is. She also put him on antibiotics. She said it could be 3 things 1) a type of cancer 2) and infection or 3) a hematoma. 

The estimated cost of the procedure is $600-1200. Riley is a happy, energetic, curious, mentally sharp boi for his age. Do I want to open the can of worms and do the surgery? What if it’s cancer and I have to put him down? I don’t think I could deal knowing I was the one to initiate this whole thing. But on the other hand I don’t want to not take action and have a cancer spread ensuring my pups doom. Any advice, two cents would help. Thanks! "	dogs

Here is the post, in case anyone wants to read through it. Hopefully the link works since I’m on mobile:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/9cgse3/help_about_to_adopt_a_dog_and_i_see_some_warning/?st=JLSA6WHJ&amp;sh=89d749e6

Basically she showed some aggression twice towards 2 other dogs standing nearby while I was giving her treats during a training session.  The next day, she was perfectly fine, and then met my roommate, her boyfriend, and her dog, and was growling and barking at them with hackles raised. I decided to pass on her. 

My mom is her foster and she said that since then she has been absolutely perfect. Startlingly well-behaved for a puppy, no aggression whatsoever towards the other dogs since that day. 

I met up with my mom today for lunch at a park and she bought the puppy along with her for some socialization. She was an absolute angel the whole time. Her behavior is exactly what I want to see in a dog. Calm, no fear, friendly towards strangers. 

She was so good, in fact, that I’m wondering if her behavior last weekend was a fluke. Maybe she was stressed by the fact that she had only been at my parents’ house for a few days and maybe she felt overwhelmed by the amount of new people she met in the span of 2 days. She certainly did not mind the multiple people in the park today that stopped to say hi to her. 

since that day she’s been spayed, maybe that makes a difference?

I’m not saying I’m second guessing my decision to pass on her (okay, maybe a tad little bit...), but I’m more looking for possible suggestions as to why a dog could flip flop like this. Does just one instance, or one day, of a dog acting off or aggressive mean that it is part of a dog’s personality? The general consensus on my previous post was that she seemed like she would grow to be very dangerous and that day I agreed, but seeing her today and hearing about how good she’s been, I just can’t see it. 

FWIW, 4 of her other siblings have been adopted and 1 is still in a foster home (another rescue took the other 6 and I haven’t heard anything about them). No one has noted any signs of aggression in any of them. But, maybe it’s one of those things that doesn’t happen till it happens. 

I’m just curious as to what people think. Thanks :)

848	[Help] Dog Neutered, ideas for care please.	" 

I found Murphy about 2 months ago. Hes some sort of mix between Irish Wolf Hound and a Terrier. He is roughly 10 months old judging by him having adult teeth and we got him neutered yesterday.

He wore the collar because he simply wouldn't stop trying to lick his stitches. Problem with that is that he barely moves with it on and when he does he just slams into everything and whines, almost continually.

So what I did was put a waterproof band aid on his suture and took the collar off. He attempted to lick it for about 2 minutes then stopped on his own, the bandaid held well and since its waterproof I know its dry and clean. My question is, is this ok? He fell asleep in about 5 minutes and is much more relaxed now. The vet said they prefer not to use bandaids and use the collar but I can't imagine him wearing this for 3-5 days. Bandaids however are cheap and I can replace them a few times a day and use the collar at times to give the wound some air time.

Thoughts?

Thank you"	dogs
849	[Fluff] It's amazing how our dogs become like us. I really love my derpy, doofus dog.	"My now ex boyfriend and I (we are still friends) adopted a rescue german shepherd/australian cattle mix named Jaye at 4 months and she's been a blessing ever since. We used to work on a farm, so she would attempt to round up the chickens and other farm animals. she was terrified for a few weeks, but she made friends with a lamb, two calves and some goats as well as the farm owner's dogs and they all became great friends. she's a quick learner, extremely well behaved, incredibly smart, great off the leash (never runs off) and 10/10 cuddle buddy.

fast forward to now. she's a year and a half and still as derpy as ever. It blows my mind that she has character traits like my ex boyfriend and i. For one, she's really clumsy like me and a huge dingus like my ex. Always doing weird things at weird times, but it was always cute.
I just went to visit her and whenever i sat on the floor she'll sit right in my lap, look around me to make sure i'm safe, and roll on her back while in my lap for belly rubs.

I just really really really reaally love my dog. Blessings to all of us, and god all dogs deserve unconditional and endless love. "	dogs

851	[Help] Male neutered dog behavioural change	"Our dog Dodger is a terrier cross (border/Jack Russell/pug/chihuahua). 16 months old. From, and living in, England. We feed him Burns dry dog food ( feeding times at 6.00 and 18.00). He's a sprightly little fella, and highly intelligent. 

We had him neutered at 10 months. In the past month he has been displaying extra territorial traits, heightened anxiety, and stubbornness. And recently, despite never previously displaying this behaviour, tried to mount a bitch in heat.
He is still eating normally (twice a day, morning and evening).
We think perhaps he still has dormant testosterone in him, but are unsure. Could this be because of bitches seasons? 

Has anybody else noticed similar behaviour in their dogs?
Any help would be appreciated.

Many thanks."	dogs
852	[Help] Dog is on anti-anxiety medication. The process of giving him the pills makes him super anxious, to the point where he starts shaking.	"We've got a two year old saluki cross.  He was on clomicalm for a few months, and we were able to get him to eat the pills by sandwiching them between a couple of liver treats.  Unfortunately the medication didn't help much, so the vet switched him to fluoxetine (prozac.)

He's been on fluoxetine for about two months, and we are starting to see some improvement.  The fluoxetine pills are capsules, and significantly bigger than the clomicalm, so the liver treat trick doesn't work. 

We were sticking them in a small piece of pepperette, and giving him a few regular pieces and then the one with the pill.  This generally worked well, but every once in a while he'd find the pill and spit it out, and we'd have to force it down his throat.

The last couple of days, he's started shaking as soon as he sees the pepperettes.  If we leave them lying around he'll eventually get curious and try to eat them, but the most recent one he ate, found the pill, and then ran into the other room and hid, shaking.

We are going to work with him so he's no longer terrified of the pepperettes, but in the meantime we need a new method for dosing him.  He doesn't like peanut butter. He's kind of indifferent about cheese. Could we break open the capsules and mix it in with some yogurt or cottage cheese?  Any other ideas?"	dogs
853	[Help] Neighbors dog tearing up fence.	"Over the past week or so, my neighbors dog (German Shepard) has been tearing down parts of the fence and coming into my back yard.

This first started occurring about a week ago. Initially, I escorted the dog (Friendly dog) back into my neighbors yard through the entry way it had created through the fence and I nailed a new plank to repair the section the dog had damaged. 

Two days later, my neighbors dog managed to break through another old part of the fence and came into my back yard yet again. I have repeated the repair process now three times. The dog however has figured out that it can simply tear down another older piece of fence to come into my back yard.

At this rate, every plank the dog has managed to tear through will have been replaced by me. Lumber is cheap, and so far I've only spent about $20 on repairing the sections damaged by the dog. However, if the existing fence is left un tampered with (ie not torn down by the dog), it should last for several more years.

Yesterday I spoke to my neighbor about the issue, and I requested she look into ways to keep their dog from coming through on their side. I even suggested they line their side of the fence with chicken wire to prevent the dog from biting/clawing at the fence. My neighbor advised she would let her husband know about the problem when he returned from work. The conversation was amicable and we exchanged numbers so that we had an open line of communication about the issue.

This morning, the dog has yet again tore down another section of the fence. On one hand, I'd like to give my neighbors the benefit of doubt; maybe they had not got a chance to address the issue since I only spoke to them about it yesterday. 

My patience is running a bit short at this point. 

Is there anything else I can do on my end? 

How much time should I give my neighbors to react before I raise the issue again?"	dogs

858	[Help] Puppy food amounts?	"I was just wondering if someone could give me some clarity on how much I should be feeding my 10 week old Corgi puppy. 

Thus far, we've been adhering to the instructions on the bag of the food that we have. For his breed size and current weight it suggests 1 and 1/4 cup of food per day, which we spread out over 3 feedings while he's young. But the little guy is always hungry! He knows when its within an hour of one of his feedings and he will follow us around when we're near his bowl or food storage area, and he will sometimes whine. 

Is it bad to feed him a bit more than the suggested amount? He does get 3 walks per day plus other playtime, so he gets plenty of exercise. We just don't want to be under-nourishing him. Thoughts?"	dogs

860	[HELP] Suddenly started barking three weeks in (rescue pup)	"Hiya! Our girl is a 5-month (ish - vet's best guess) Bodeguero crossed with who-knows-what.

She's  got the usual puppy behaviours - slightly more challenging because  she'd never been in a house before we got her three weeks ago, let alone  had any training - but generally is an utter delight. She spends three days a week at the farm where my husband works and is learning to be a  good doggy very quickly, although obviously she still has her moments :)

However, the last few days she's been worrying me a bit by becoming *extremely*  vocal - barking whenever she hears someone talking near the house (we live in a terraced townhouse so that's... a lot), when a dog barks anywhere in hearing range, and often when she sees, hears or smells something I've not even registered.

Have  you guys got any tips to encourage her to stop? I'm a bit concerned about the neighbours if this becomes a permanent habit. They're very  understanding at the moment because they know she's a baby and still settling in, but I don't want to take the piss.

Notes:

* Until this week she barely barked at home at all - only when very overtired or when she spotted cats in the garden
* The neighbours tell me that when she's left alone she'll bark/cry for maybe  five minutes and then be good as gold until we're home - but she's almost always asleep when she's on her own so I guess she's not being  triggered by anything
* She barks a little bit when she's left downstairs at bedtime but she quietens down very quickly
* She doesn't have an *awful* past, as far as I know - she was in a Spanish pound for a few weeks as a baby (which wouldn't have been very nice at all) and then the rescue got her in nice private kennels until she could come to the UK. So...  turbulent puppyhood but not abusive, basically.
* She's not being crate trained because she really, really doesn't like  confined spaces. I have a feeling this is because of the above. It's not  really as universal in the UK as it is in the US anyway.
* When  we're out and about, she barks at much bigger (only giant breed, really) dogs and (even more worryingly) horses - the stable girls say  she doesn't seem scared, and they've raised dogs there for years"	dogs
861	[help] my dog is getting a bald spot on his leg	"I have a 3 yr old West Highland White Terrier. I’ve noticed recently he was licking his outer hind thigh a lot. I looked at it and it was what I would describe as a balding spot, and his skin felt rough to the touch. On the inside of his other thigh (pelvic area) I noticed he had what looks like a scab. I tried researching and the symptoms pointed to round worm or hot spots. 
I’ve been told in the past by the place I’ve taken him for grooming that he has dry skin.

He's aggressive to anyone who isn't me or my mom. Another major problem is that he will bark and bark and bark every night for hours and he's starting to affect my dad because he can't sleep which affects him at his job.

My parents have currently three dogs at their house (family house + garden).

**#1 – West Highland White Terrier**

* actually it's mine (I'm the second owner, dog was transferred to me when he was an adult already)
* had to leave him at parents house due to my move &amp; rapid limitation of my time &amp; he prefers the company of other dogs around
* pees in the house if there are any other dogs (not in my parents' house only, he does it in all houses where another dog is), pees on anything (including but not limited to the bed covers, water bottles, etc.)

**#2 – Black Labrador with a little genetic mix-up (he is all labrador-y except he did not grow, so it's more like a large dachshund)** 

* poops in the house, never pees

**#3 – No race dog, born stray and to homeless mother, pretty big and high**

* the oldest member of the household
* used to pee &amp; poop in the house, now it's rarer, he just pees in places where the #1 dog peed

Parents have never had neither time nor patience for training dogs not to pee in the house, hence the craziness. It just hurts to come home and see everytime seas of pee and poops. I wonder if there's a way to try to undo this madness, provided that I can come home only on weekends and my parents are working full-time jobs early to late, so they come back tired and they don't really have patience for teaching them.

869	[Help] 1 Year old dog getting aggressive	"Sorry about the wall of text and random runoffs of probably useless info.

About a year ago I was looking for a dog for my fiancee either a German Shepherd or husky found some one advertising husky pups went and looked at them the guy who was selling them had a hard time speaking English the puppy looked great and saw a few other of the pups who already had deposits on them.

I asked to see the parents and he showed me the female definitely a pure bred Siberian really good looking dog.
The guy then started heading back towards the house and in another fenced off area I saw another dog and stopped and he mentioned that was the father I realised it was not a husky wasn't sure what it was but he said malamute I know malamutes are larger and longer haired and have a huskyish look but don't really know much about them. Anyways I was still happy with the pup and decided to buy it. Fast forward a couple of months and both me and the fiancee noticed he was starting to look different from even a husky malamute mix but didn't think much of it. 

We live on a lot of land far away from neighbors and unfenced he was allowed outside without being leashed did great he knew not to go to far and never had a problem with him leaving as he got older he started to get more stubborn listening to commands whether sitting come here etc especially if he was focused on something else. We had farm animals to early on as a pup we made sure to train him not to go after them or play rough with them and he did just fine he loved watching them he got to the point where he would not move from watching our farm animals or birds etc if we needed to put him up to run an errand Everytime we would pick him up and start walking away from what he was focused on he would start getting aggressive and got me a couple of times and my fiancee he was probably 5/6 months at this age. We ended up getting one of those vibrating collars to break his focus worked amazing if he wouldn't listen vibrate him once and repeat the command and he would do it flawlessly. Now the collar doesn't work for him half the time so we stopped using it and he's getting out of control not listening unless we use treats wont go into his cage or anything now if we tell him to do something and he doesn't want to he will start growling at us and if we wanted to pick him up or kind of scoot him towards the direction we want him to go he gets aggressive

He's the strangest acting dog I've ever owned or known not super social prefers
 to be by himself he does get excited to see me or my fiancee or my brother but other than that his demeanor doesn't seem like most dogs.

Now throughout these last couple of months I have realised the father is a spitting image of a wolf/timberwolf? 

I don't really have a way to surely know but I ran into a person who bred timberwolfs and had two females with him he saw my dog and came up to me and said he was a very good looking timberwolf hybrid I told hin I wasn't sure if he was actually a hybrid. Now I take him to the dog park occasionally he keeps to himself doesn't like other dogs trying to chase him or mess with him and this guy with amazing gsd ex service dog that you could of swore understood every bit of English the human was speaking to him haha he was there training a new service dog and walked up to me asking I could bring my dog up to his pup to try to get his pup to break concentration. After a minute or two he asked if he could give my dog a treat and started talking to my dog and said your a good wolfdog!

It's starting to make me think my dog actually is a ""wolfdog"" and might be the cause of his behavior changing. He has also recently started trying to get my fiancees rabbits through the cage and he has never ever tried to nip one if they were roaming around the yard with him out. And even more recent the last two weeks he has been starting to pee randomly indoors and has even peed on the rabbit cage.

I hate being kind of jipped on buying this dog if he turned out to be a wolf dog we wanted more of a family dog we could take to the park or hangout with us etc. I don't feel like we could even re-home him as he doesn't do super well with people who don't know how to interact with inside a home environment and who wants a dog that starting to get aggressive? I don't know what to do. My mother and father actually got a wolfdog before I was born and my mother even pointed it out a couple months after having my dog that my dog looked just like theirs sadly before I was born they had to try to re-home their wolfdog because of his personality and afraid of him getting me as a newborn and we're unable to find him a home and had to take him to a shelter and they were unable to take him due to being a wolfdog and they could only put him down.

So many people are surprised when they hear that grapes and Xylitol are just as deadly, if not more. It's fine, not everyone keeps these things in mind. But that's why when I first meet someone I let them know. There's more, like onions and garlic, but those fall into the category of just _""please don't give him any human food""_ that's just good advice for both behavior and health.

Mom comes over for a visit, she's had the ""no gum, grapes, or chocolate anywhere he can reach it"" talk months back, but was chewing some gum. Whatever, she's an adult right? I can't police my own mother about gum that's already in her mouth.

Well next thing I know I hear _""He got the gum!""_ just outta nowhere. I don't know how he got it, she doesn't know how he got it, but he's a clever boy.

Thank god we've been working on our _""drop it""_ and impulse control, plus the gum was what she had already been chewing for a while so it's likely most of the Xylitol was already leeched out of it. So he spat it out immediately, tolerated a mouth check for stray particles, and retreated to the couch. It was a close call, I feel, that was completely unnecessary.

877	[Help] I can't stop my dog from pissing and shitting in the house	"My 3 year old kuvasz, Philadelphia, has sporadically had problems pissing or shitting in the house, starting as a 9 mo puppy coming home. It's always when I'm not around, and it's in either the great room or the closet.

Once a week, he would go in the great room carpet. I cleaned it up, got a shag rug to cover it. I couldn't clean that rug adequately, so I tossed it. He continued to go once a week. I got a new rug. Soiled that one, still once a week. I removed it, he found a new place on the carpet again and it got worse and I recognized it was always in the same spot and that if I was cleaning it, it must have sunk where I couldn't clean. I spent $400 that I didn't have and worked really, really hard to rip up the carpet, clean the stain on the concrete floor (it was that bad! no wonder), and paint and treat the concrete. 

Now that it was a concrete floor, he only went once a month or so, when it was a bowel emergency. 

Three weeks ago, he went in the closet during the night - on my work clothes. I was livid. Some redditors said that I have to re-kennel train him, so I kept him in his kennel or on a leash within eyesight for two weeks. No problems, so I let him off again and barracaded the great room with boxes. 

A week after being free (today), I find that he's urinated in that room twice in one day and was about to commit a third time, all in different spots. Let's face it, he's a 120 lb dog, he goes where he wants. The path to that room is super wide and it is meant to be open, so installing double doors isn't an option and would hurt the house. I've tried baby gates, it's super expensive because the path is very wide, and it doesn't work, he's 120 lbs, he pushes them over with ease even as a puppy, he does what he wants. 

I love him like a son but I just don't want to live like this. I don't know what to do and I am considering getting rid of him. It's too cruel to let him be an outside dog only, and I don't want a dog that has to live on a leash or in a kennel. 

Please help. I don't know what to do

There is nothing wrong with him health wise. He does not have seperation anxiety. He was neutered at 6 mo or so. His diet hasn't changed, nothing really has changed.

878	[Help] Found dog outside, won't stop barking!	"I'm at the end of my rope here. I found a dog outside a few hours ago while walking my dog. He had a leash and harness on so I assumed he had an owner and walked around my apartment complex but didn't see any site of another person. I took him back to my apartment figuring I could take him to the shelter and make flyers around the area saying where I had taken him (I live in a small, strict apartment who would absolutely freak if they knew I had another dog now.)

Thing is, he won't shut up and my roommates are not having it. They have work early in the morning and this dog is full on barking. I currently have him fenced off in the kitchen and would bring him in my room but the rooms are carpeted and he had already shown he is not potty trained. The longer it goes the more they can't take it and want to put him back outside. I don't want to just leave him out, is there anything I could do? The animal shelters in my area are closed and the closest one is an half hour away and it's already late.

879	[Discussion] How Did You Decide Your Dog’s Name?	"I was at my parent’s house with my precious little noodle when she was just 10 weeks old after my dad surprised me with her (rescued). She was just curled up on my lap sleeping, and my dad, stepmom, grandparents and I were springing names off each other. Before I got her I had tossed around “Calliope” - I like names that end with the “ee” sounds - but it just didn’t feel right for her. My dad was adamant about Muffy, short for snuggle muffin, which also didn’t suit her. After suggesting names for an hour, we got to Disney movies and my dad said “well too bad she isn’t a boy, you loved Winnie the Pooh as a kid.” And after looking down at her, Winnie just seemed to fit her best. 

Dad still calls her Winnie Snugglemuffin though. 🤔

How did you pick your fur baby’s name?

880	[Discussion] Defending against dog attacks?	"Yesterday our 17 lb Chihuahua mix mutt was attacked by a pitbull. My SO was walking her through our neighborhood when the pitbull ran through an unlocked gate and immediately grabbed our dog in its mouth, lifted her bodily from the ground, and started shaking her back and forth.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily the pitbull's owner came running out and started yelling at the dog to stop, and only got it to drop our dog by repeatedly striking the pitbull in the head.

&amp;#x200B;

Our dog is recovering and is extremely lucky to be alive. What's bothering my SO and myself is the fact that our dog would likely be dead if the owner hadn't been there. We haven't worried about dog attacks before, but with how fast an entirely unprompted attack happened we are looking for ways to defend ourselves in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any experience with dog attack deterrents such as horns or sprays? I'm even considering getting a heavy walking cane to bring on walks going forward, because I'm under no illusions about how myself or my dog would fare against a pitbull in another attack.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I understand that prevention and reporting the offending dog as dangerous are the main steps I can take to prevent another attack, however, I would like to have some form of dog deterrent should an attack happen again. It's not something I want to have to plan for, but this experience has taught me that I want to have some sort of defense on hand, just in case."	dogs

883	Doggy Questions [Discussion]	" 

Hi dog people,

I have three quick questions about doggy behaviour I'm hoping for help with! Po is a 1-year-old lab mix.

One, Po likes to watch out the windows or sit on the balcony and watch the world go by. 99.9% of the time she just calmly sits and gazes around (we're on the 7th floor, so not a ton of nearby excitement), and if she does whine or bark, we call her inside and close the door, so that barking on the balcony is penalised with no access to balcony. So she sometimes carries a squeaky toy out there to watch traffic with, but mostly just sits and watches, and I'm wondering is that safe/ok as long as it's not winding her up?

Two, when leash walking, Po is pretty good about not yanking forward (except when she needs to poop, God help us when she needs to poop). However, she likes to pull sideways, like if I'm on the right of the sidewalk, she likes to be on the left, would probably walk onto the road if I gave her more slack. And it's not to sniff, she just drifts further and further away. It doesn't bother me a ton because she's not pulling hard so much as drifting, but we do live in an almost downtown area, and it gets annoying with people passing us on the sidewalk. Does anyone have any tips for this?

Three, when Po has to poop she gets super hyper about everything. Especially dogs we walk by. Normally she's excited to see other dogs but I can distract her and focus her on me until we're by them, but when she's in the poop zone, she goes batty, jumping 3 feet in the air, jumping on me, on the other dog walker, biting her leash, etcetera. On her afternoon walks I try to avoid other dogs until she's done her business, but with it being a dog-friendly neighbourhood with high traffic roads, I can't always just cross the road before she reaches threshold. Any tips for dealing with the hyper poop-monster when we have to pass other dogs in close quarters? We have a halti for her that we use occasionally for known tough spots on our walks (like the 100m up to the dog park), should I maybe use her halti til she's pooped?

Anyways, any help appreciated!"	dogs
884	[Help] How do I teach my dog to signal to me when she needs to go out?	"So my shepherd pup is almost a year old and still not housebroken, which as you can imagine is a serious cause of stress in the household. The thing is, she knows exactly where to go the bathroom when I let her out. She runs immediately to the grass, and even has designated areas of the yard for pee or poop. The problem is that she gives absolutely 0 indication of when she has to go, so if no one is around to let her out on their own, she'll just go in the house. This forces me to let her out every couple hours or so, but even then she may not need to go when I let her out and then proceed to go in the house right afterwards. I've tried to create a consistent schedule for her, but sometimes I'll walk into a surprise accident in the house every now and then.

Is there someway for me to teach her to bark when she needs to go out or spin around in a circle or something? I'm at a complete loss and feel like such a failure for having a dog for a year that isn't housebroken."	dogs
885	[Help] Training tips and resources for dog with territorial dog	"Hi there,

I'm in the process of trying to adopt a dog and I'm told he comes with a couple issues.

About the dog: he's 7-8 months old, looks to be a Flat Coated Retriever, but I'm assuming not a purebred.  He was rescued from the South where he was kept outside on a chain.  The rescue got him at the beginning of the summer when he was about 6 months old.  

So off the bat they know he's not good with young children.  The rescue director said that he did jump over a gate and lunge at her 4 yr old with no warning growl.  Is this a serious red flag?  I don't have kids now, but will in a few years.  And I don't have kids visiting me.  So there's no immediate risk bringing him into the house, but I'd like to work on this so there's no surprises or issues in a few years when I do have kids.  If there's still time to train this out of him, I'm happy to do it.  

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd issue is that he gets territorial of his owner (or foster parents in these situations) when other dogs in the house get toys or attention from his person.  They didn't see him exhibit any dog aggression when out on walks and being near other dogs outside the house.  This seems like an easier thing to work with once he feels secure and safe (or I could be totally wrong?).  He'll be our first dog and while I want more dogs one day, there's no rush at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

So all that said, any tips, and advice,  or book/website/youtube resources for these specific issues would be much appreciated."	dogs
886	[Discussion] does anyone have any grooming tips for a GSD mix with seemingly no undercoat, but sheds like CRAZY!!!	"Hi everyone,

I’m having a hard time trying to figure out what type of fur my GSD mix has. He seems to have a very light layer of undercoat fur, but the majority of the fur he sheds tends to be long almost coarse-like fur that’s also soft to touch - if that makes any sense AT ALL. All of the fur that ends up on my floor and clothes are straight single hairs with auburn coloured tips. 

He’s been shedding an incredible amount for the last month or so, and I have a funny feeling he may be blowing his coat right now. 

My question is.... what kind of brush should I be using for this seemingly mixed type of fur??? I want to buy the Furminator but is it actually worth it and does it do what it says it does? Which one would be the best to even get considering my dog’s bizarre fur type??

Any advice would be appreciated greatly. His shedding is driving me crazy!!!! I need some relief.  

Also: I took him to the groomer and they used Furminator deshedding shampoo and conditioner... and it literally seemed to do absolutely nothing!! "	dogs

888	[help] Not sure if dog has fleas or if I'm paranoid	"Dumb question...but I have to ask for my sanity's sake.

I don't think my dog itches more than any other dog, but she does scratch often enough where I'm sort of wondering if she might have fleas? She scratches her side and sometimes her ear/head every couple of hours, and sometimes will bite at her legs/paws, but it never goes for very long and she hasn't scratched herself raw. Her fur is black so it's hard for me to see if there is anything on her skin and I haven't felt any bumps or seen anything off in her ears. 

But with all the scratching plus 2 bug bites that randomly appeared overnight on my leg, I'm wondering if she is at the beginning stages of having fleas? Am I being paranoid? How often is too much for a dog to be scratching herself??"	dogs

890	[Help]Found a stray dog and have a hard decision to make about his health	"My wife follows a local group on Facebook that posts lost dogs or strays seen in the area. I'm assuming this is common (I don't use any social media other than reddit). 

Anyway, several people posted seeing a Great Dane wandering down the highway. These posts popped up over several days. We currently have a Dane so they have special place in our hearts. She decided to go to his last seen location and look for him. Well, she found him almost immediately in a ditch unable to stand on his own. A couple of guys stopped and helped her get him in the car then she went straight to the vet. 

Our vet was able to tell he was about 6-7 years old, had heart worms, and probably had a broken leg/shoulder. The vet took a couple x-rays and found a dislocated elbow. He tried to put it back in place but was unable to. He is getting in touch with a specialist who can do surgery to fix the dislocated elbow and get us an estimate. We are expecting the surgery to be several thousand dollars at least. 

If you've read this much, you probably already see the problem. My wife bonds quickly with animals and feels the need to care for all of them. I love her for this. So, after sitting in the ditch with him until someone came then sitting with him at the vet for a while she already wants to adopt him. While we could probably afford the surgery, it would make things extremely tight for us. Also, we aren't sure if he would make it through heart worm treatment. I am looking at the practical side of things, and I want to do what is right. But, I've never been in this position with a stray. 

Can anyone offer their opinion? Or if they have been in this situation some advice? Sorry for the wall of text. "	dogs

I had another idea of confining her to one room instead of the tiny kennel, which will be my room. this is where the dog sleeps during the day, and never has accidents in that room. so to me, it's like a bigger crate.

\------------------------------------------------------

 This is going to be a wall of texts. If you care about your money and time, keep reading. Otherwise, go waste your $$$.  


This  is my story. I did get my dog's DNA tested by Embark and Wisdom Panel  before. I know you guys think I'm crazy to spend that much money on  those, but it's my choice.  


So I tried Identibreed after Embark  and WP. I bought the test sample a few months ago. However, it arrived  damaged. The package was beat up badly. I decided to email  Identibreed  to see what they could do about it. They agreed to send me a replacement  for FREE! That was awesome. But when I was about to return the damaged  one, I couldn't beat my curiosity, so I went online registering info to  see what's there. As other people said, they required a picture of my  dog. That was shady because they might use it to identify my dog's  breeds instead of doing the actual test. So I just picked a picture of a  cartoon bulldog (looks like from Tom &amp; Jerry). But I didn't expect  them to do anything with this because I didn't send the test sample to  them.  


A few days later, the replacement came in my mail box as  promised. I couldn't be happier and grateful because I got it for free.  Just like before, I went online to register my dog's info. This time I  picked a picture of a cow (actually a funny meme from Skyrim). After  taking my dog's saliva and fur, I sent the whole package to Identibreed.  


Two  weeks later, Identibreed came back to me with TWO RESULTS!!! Guess  what??? It's the cartoon bulldog one that I tried registering without  sending any sample!!! The other was the free one. Now look at the two  photos I attached below. See how hilarious and funny this company is?  They judge my dog's breeds by the pictures!! And they do it without you  sending them the test sample!!! Yes they do, there's nothing to make  excuse about it, especially the bulldog pic!!! I laughed so hard that  everyone in my house thought I was having mental issues. And to clarify,  my dog is a one year old Chihuahua mix that weighs only 15lbs. I  attached the test results from Embark and WP too. You can see how close  they were. They are legit, but not Identibreed.  


I don't know why  so Many people fell for the trap. You guys should have used your brain  to figure out that you should not use your dog's photo. Asking for a  picture is just ridiculous. Also, why do the cotton swabs come without  any cover to prevent contamination?  This is a basic rule that everyone  should know.  


So there you go. Another day on Amazon, another scam. "	dogs

She’s his master and he’ll go for walks with her no trouble.

Before if you told him the word walk he would get so excited, now it barely phases him unless it’s my mom saying it. Lately more then ever he has been terrible to take for a walk. He walks a couple yards and sniffs around. But once he does his poop he’s just not interested in moving forward. He just sits their and won’t move a foot forward. I’ll tug on him but he wants none of it. No matter how long I stand their and tell him to come on or how many times I tug on his leash he won’t walk.

898	[Discussion] dog parks	"I know a lot don't bother going to dog parks and I'm beginning to understand why. 

Since I've gotten Alfie, we've gone every day, multiple times (lol big talk for day 4 right?)... but we've usually gone when it's empty or one other dog is there. Ndb, they run around and within 30 minutes, he's heeling by me, ready to go.. or if it's us, we work on off leash training. 

Today though, we went and 2 dogs joined in. They sniffed and played for a bit. Then back to sniffing. One of the dogs kept sniffing Alfie and tried to mount him. Alfie jumped away and did a small growl. They played again until it happened again, but this time, Alfie barked. A definite ""you need to back off"" bark. By then, the other dogs owner told the dog to stop. The dog kept trying though and Alfie would do these grumpy old man mumbles and move away. By the third actual ""warning"" (second bark) from Alfie, that's when I decided we should go... I could tell the dog kept trying to mount Alfie and it didn't seem like the other owner could, or would do anything about it... also not even sure what the owners could've done other than remove their dog? 

Did I handle this wrong though? Would they have worked it out or am I right in assuming it could have led to a fight? Was Alfie's behavior wrong in warning that other dog not to mount him? He didn't nip, bite or anything, just grumbles, growls and barks. 

I really do like the fact that he can play with other dogs, run around, get some hard physical work in there (I cannot run as fast as him lol)... plus we get to work on our training (things he knows but it's nice to work on it with major distractions). "	dogs
899	[help] something wrong with dog’s toe	"Hey! First off, I want to say that I’m going to take him to the vet, I just want to know if I need to do so tonight or if I can wait till Monday or Tuesday. I appreciate any insight you can give! 

So I have a 2 ish year old, 75 lb, blue heeler mix, Max, and he’s pretty active. We run 3-5 times a week on concrete. He’s my first dog and my baby, so I may be worrying needlessly.  

This morning when he went outside he was fine and everything was normal. However, this afternoon when I let him outside, he immediately laid down and started licking his paw super intensely. I looked at it and it has some weird white skin attached to the nail bed and the sides of his toe are raw and red looking. He’s favoring that paw a little, but there’s no significant change in his energy.  He spends all day in his kennel, so he didn’t get into anything weird today. 

I’ve cleaned it, put Neosporin on it, and have covered it in a sock in an attempt to keep it clean.  

Like I said, I’m going to take him to the vet, but in my inexperience, I’m not sure whether it warrants an emergency vet visit or if it can wait.

900	[Help] Please help me help my dog!!	"My family and I have had our dog Luna for a little over a year now and she is the best part of my life. She’s fairly small (a little under thirty pounds) and she loves to cuddle. She’s around seven or eight years old but we don’t really know since we rescued her. We think she had a pretty rough go of things while she was on the street (she had just given birth to a litter of puppies when we got her and the vets said it was likely not her first time, she’s only scared of big dogs if they’re male, and she was really scared of humans when we first got her) and it seems to still be affecting her. I should also probably say now that I am fairly clueless when it comes to dogs but I am trying to be better for her. For as long as we’ve had her she has liked to constantly scratch and nibble on herself. It’s basically a hobby for her. I asked the vet about it just to make sure that it was ok and the vet assured me that it wasn’t harmful. Recently however she has been chewing on her stomach and she has a big, red, bloody splotch. She’s also started to chew on her feet to the point that they always look pink and tender. There haven’t been any changes in our family or in the way that we treat her so I’m not sure what the cause of it is. 

Long story short, what do I do? Have any of you ever seen this behavior in your dogs? What is the cause of this sudden change? Any and all help is greatly appreciated!!! I just want her to be happy and healthy.

I’m more worried about all of his bites. His tummy gets bitten a lot and I see them biting him but I don’t know what to do. 

Is there a pet friendly solution to this? Obviously I can’t start spraying my dog with a big old can of OFF.

Or is three months not enough time to get used to it? If you've used a gentle leader, how long did it take your pup to get used to it?"	dogs
904	[Discussion] Should I even keep my dog?	"**TL;DR: I live in an apartment and my dog refuses the activities I'm able to provide and instead tears up my living space and chases my cat. I don't want this dog to be bored and cooped up forever and I don't want my cat to suffer. Also I'm worried about her destroying the apartment. Is this a hopeless situation?**


I've always heard the advice that you need to accept the dog you have and not try to make it something it isn't. I'm just worried that the dog I have will be unhappy in the lifestyle I'm able to provide.


I recently adopted a two year old shepherd mix from the humane society. When I picked her up, she was shy and quiet. The people at the humane society assured me she was housebroken and crate trained. I asked them if they thought she would be suited for an apartment with cats, provided I gave her several walks a day. They said absolutely.


Come to find a month later, none of this is true. She is NOT housebroken and despite going out 8-12 times a day, continues to have accidents inside. We tried crating her and she will throw herself against the crate. Even our slow training has not shown any results whatsoever. Sitting next to her feeding her through the bars, even if she's just in there for five minutes, doesn't calm her at all.


She is way too fixated on the cat. In a shepherd I'm especially worried about this, as she will follow too closely and quickly, and not take her eyes off the cat as soon as it enters a room. I cannot leave the two alone together for any amount of time. I'm following every guide to redirecting her attention with treats and praise, but she inevitably goes back to hounding the cat.


I think the worst thing right now is she HATES walks. She is a two year old with boundless energy and I cannot get her to walk. She fights me every step of the way, trying to turn back to the apartment. A half mile walk turns into an hour long ordeal of trying to out-stubborn her. I've tried treats and stopping every five feet to praise her and keep her going, I think she just hates the leash. And yes, we've tried more than one kind. On a selfish note, I always loved walking and was really looking forward to having a dog again to get out an explore. But this dog is 100% homebody, but with energy levels through the roof.


Of course, she's burned no energy during that time so when we get back she proceeds to tear up my couch cushions and chase the cat. 


She is dog aggressive and won't listen to recall, so I can't take her to a dog park or any park. The only real exercise she likes is if I take her to my parents' and use their fenced yard to play fetch. But she also hates car rides and will cry the whole way there, so I feel bad forcing her to go even three times a week. 


My husband and I have opposite work schedules, so the longest she is alone is 4 hours. I feel that with most people working 8 hour days, that's pretty good. But it doesn't matter how long we're home or away if we can't give her a daily energy outlet. We've tried playing fetch with her in the apartment, but I'm worried with her running that she'll wreck the carpet and bug our downstairs neighbors.


I've raised and trained dogs my whole life, and my husband has exclusively raised shepherds. After a month, I've always seen some sort of improvement, but since she won't get out and exercise her behavior just seems to be getting worse and worse. 


Yesterday I tried to walk her for an hour, then gave up and went to my parents and played fetch for two and a half hours until she wouldn't even chase the ball anymore. We still got home and she wouldn't leave the cat alone.


Schedule: 7am bathroom and food, 10am bathroom and walk attempt, 11:30 bathroom, 4 hours home alone with a Kong stuffed with food, 5pm food, bathroom and walk attempt, then I'm home for the night and will watch for any cues that she needs to go to the bathroom. I still take her out every two hours to try and avoid accidents. 10pm bathroom and walk attempt, 2am bathroom.


She's a sweetheart when she's not destroying things, so I hate to think of rehoming her but I just can't even tell if this situation is any good for her in the long run. If she is a dog who just hates walks and can't be with smaller animals, an apartment is no good for her. If I had a house with a yard it might be a different story, but that won't be for a couple years. I don't know how long to keep trying, or if I'm just torturing this energetic dog and my cat."	dogs
905	[Help] neglected husky puppy	"Before I start this, I would like to say that I do not talk to the owners. I am not friends or even acquaintances with the owners. I would not feel comfortable going up to them for a confrontation. 


So. A house around my neighborhood recently got a husky puppy. She has to be maybe a few months old. We live in Ohio. Recently it’s been in the 90s. 93, 94 around there. She is left outside for hours on end. As early as 7 am, and as late as 10 pm. (Not to mention those are just the times I have driven by after work and what not.) while she does have bowls outside, it is too far up to see if there is anything even in them. They don’t have a fence. So she’s on a lead that sometimes will get tangled. 

The direct neighbors across the street have confronted them about her getting tangled, as they were worried she would accidentally strangle herself. 

Is there any action that I could take, or get someone involved? It breaks my heart every time I pass and see her lonely. "	dogs
906	[Help] Dogs keep charging up to my dog whilst she's on the lead and she's started becoming very reactive. What do I do about this?	"I've had a couple of incidents whilst walking my dog recently and confronting one of the owners has got me even more concerned. I normally walk my dog on the lead as we're still working on the ""Don't go running up to every single person/ dog you see"" thing but she's normally super friendly. Up until the last couple of days she's never attacked another dog or shown any sign of aggression outside of playing rough.

First incident was with a dog called Harley. We've met Harley a few times and they're pretty neutral towards each other. He's always been with a woman on a lead and we've even walked together. Get to the field a couple of nights ago and I see this dog running over full speed growling at Winnie and a man in the background calling it back. Dog slams into her snapping and I pull her back and hold on to her as she is now going absolutely ape shit. Harley was still growling at her for about ten seconds or so whilst the guy slowly walks over to us and puts him back on the lead. Note, my dog is still going mental. Guy stands there saying how good Harley is on the lead etc. etc. whilst I'm trying to drag my mutt away. As soon as there was some distance between them she calmed down and was her normally tail waggy self. Not even five minutes later another dog comes charging over, Buster, but the owner called him back before he got to her. Last time Buster came over, the woman told me to hold my dog and not to touch him as he's not good with people and can get aggressive with other dogs. Fantastic, eh?

Anyway, tonight. Walking across a football field and there are two dogs on the opposite side off the lead. French bulldog starts running over but owner calls it back and it stays next to her but keeps looking over at Winnie. Black Cockapoo (I think) is also checking my dog out and after half a minute comes running over. The owner's back is turned, isn't calling the dog back, and is at least 30m away. Had Winnie on a very short lead and actually pinned the dog down before I realised what she was doing. Got her off and behaving and the dog runs away whining. Owner still doesn't even look back. I shout over that she just pinned his down down, didn't bite and he just waved his hand at me.

Keep going with my walk and as I'm coming back I see them again about 30m walking toward the path I'm on. The see me and keep walking over. Winnie keeps stopping to look, nothing more, but they keep walking over with dogs still off the lead. Winnie didn't pull at the lead or act aggressive, just kept stopping to look at them, but I was still a bit worried about round two kicking off.

Took my mutt back home and went to the park to speak to the guy with the black dog. Pointed out my dog was on a lead, he followed me even after there had been an incident, and asked him to be more respectful about the fact I have a rescued ex street dog who I tried to keep at a distance from his dogs. Quick note, I'm about 5'5"" and a UK size 8 so I'm not the biggest girl out there, and I barely made this guy's shoulders. He leaned over to me and said that his dog would be staying off the lead. Finished it with me raising my hands, saying ""Fine."" and walking away.

Pretty shaken when I got back and now worried about taking my dog out, or when my mum who is scared of dogs she doesn't know walks her. Any help in how to deal with this or if anything did happen, who is technically responsible?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: This is a general purpose area and often has lots of kids and football practise going on, so I don't see letting my dog off the lead as an option. One, because she'll run up to kids and I don't want them to be scared. Two, she'll probably bankrupt me destroying footballs.

It's also good to note that I live in a city and this is the only place around here I can walk her that isn't a side walk, and won't need me to spend money for petrol/ parking/ public transport twice a day for her walks.

907	[discussion] feeling guilty about my old training methods.	hey guys, i got a puppy about a month and a half ago, she was 8 weeks, and when i got her, she was a naughty girl. always peeing/pooping/biting everything as to be expected from a puppy. i used to yell at her and sometimes she would cower and i think one time when she was still 8 weeks i scared her because she was chewing something that she could choke on and i tried to get it out of her mouth but i ended up gagging her and she ran away from me, and i chased her and shouted at her and i remember her cowering. i dont know why all of a sudden i feel guilty about this but i was wondering if you guys think she remembers this stuff today, that was like 6 weeks ago or so. i try to control my temper now as much as i can and i think our relationship's pretty good but do you guys think that it'd be better if i didnt do these things in the past? its really tearing me apart	dogs
908	[Discussion] CBD Oil To Treat Epilepsy	"Hello Reddit, my Jasper is 5.5 years old and has been suffering from seizures of the grand mal kind since he was 18 months. These grand mals are also cluster seizures as well. He is a Black Lab/Rough Collie mix.
Jasper had been prescribed to phenobarbitol during his time with epilepsy but was never cured of the seizures. The seizures seemed to derive from being startled (other dogs, loud noises etc)
Now it seems his seizures have evolved into more often, but not clustered. And derives from anything. Even when hes been sleeping.
I have heard and read articles about cbd oil and how its grest for epilepsy in dogs and I am curious about this form of medicating him. First, I went to my vet and asked what he thought and he was very open to it but couldnt prescribe it. But noted that he had heard great things and that I could try because it wouldnt hurt to at least try...
My question is: Does anyone have a link or product of a cbd oil that treats epilepsy in dogs? I have done alot of research but always get pointed in the direction of a hemp oil for joint pain, anxiety etc.

913	[Help] is crate sharing a thing?	"Our girls have two separate crates that they stay in when we go to work (mostly work from home, occasionally have to be on site for 5 hours a day, 2 days a week, so they’re not crated very often). 

Our 3 year old often hangs out in her crate when  we’re home. The 5 month old has taken to going in there with her. At first, we tried to stop it. But older dog seems totally fine with this... they mostly just sleep or lay together in there and play with puzzle toys. The 3 year old’s crate is also oversized—I overestimated her growth when I first adopted her and had no idea what I was doing in terms of proper crate sizes, but she has always seemed to like the extra space. The 5 month old’s crate is a more appropriate size for her. They fit in the 3 year old’s crate together comfortably. 

Lately, when we go to leave for work and call them to their crates, the 5 month old tries to run in the older dogs crate. When we put her in her’s, she starts crying. She’s never cried like this before.

My partner thinks it would be fine to let them share the older dog’s crate when we’re gone. I think maybe we just need to move the little one’s crate to another room in the house (the crates now are in the same room, but in diagonal corners). What’s the right move? Wouldn’t it be a bad idea to have them share one?"	dogs
914	[Help] Dog constantly pulls his paw away from me while I'm trying to trim his nails	"As the title states, I'm having some issues trimming my dog's nails. He constantly pulls his paw away from me when I'm trying to trim his nails. I'm using a Dremel, a proper woodworking one, turned down to the lowest setting. I don't know what model it is or how many RPMs the lowest setting is. He doesn't seem bothered by the noise itself as his demeanor doesn't seem to change when I turn it on. If the Dremel is on and I'm holding his paw, he will try to pull his paw away from me for a little while but eventually seems to give up. As soon as the Dremel touches his nail, he pulls his paw away. It also seems like once I get the Dremel onto his nail and started, he seems to relax or allow it to happen for the most part. As soon as I'm done and move to the next nail, the fight starts all over again. I'm generally able to handle his paws without issue outside of attempts to trim his nails. I can hold his paws, massage them, play with his toes, and etc and he generally doesn't mind. Sometimes he'll pull away from me but he is generally okay with me touching them.

I've tried taking him to a groomer but he snarls and growls and even nips at them. The groomer put a muzzle on him but he ended up thrashing about trying to keep her from trimming his nails while also trying to get the muzzle off. It's totally out of character for him and I was incredibly surprised to see him acting like that. He doesn't do that with me and instead just pulls his paw away from me or squirms and tries to re-position himself to where he thinks I can't do his nails. I've used this Dremel on his nails multiple times in the past, and it has been a battle each time, but I'm at the point where I'm losing my patience with him.

I tried to do it today and every time he pulled away from me or squirmed or re-positioned, I got more and more upset with him. I know I shouldn't be and that it doesn't help the situation but it's a constant battle and I'm just so tired of fighting him. I could do his nails in 10-15 minutes and be done with it but instead it's a whole to-do that takes an hour or more. I've tried bribing him with lots of treats, and I mean LOTS of treats, but I'm only one person. I don't have enough arms and hands to feed him treats, pet him, hold his paw, and operate the Dremel all at the same time.

**TL;DR: I'm looking for advice for trimming my dog's nails. He pulls his paw away as soon as the Dremel touches it but he does fine if I'm able to get the grinding started. The behavior begins all over again on the next nail. This turns what should be a 10-15 minute affair into an hour long battle. He's okay with the Dremel noise or at least seems to be. Vet or groomer are out of the question as he snarls, growls, and nips at them.**"	dogs

He is a 5 year old cockapoo that is supposedly house trained. His owner said he sometimes gets nervous and gave me medication to give if he becomes very anxious. I was told to only give the medication if he starts frantically pacing and while has hasn't been frantically pacing, he is moderately pacing every once in a while. I got the ok from the owner to give him the medication 2 hours ago. It has had no effect. 

I have had the dog for less than 12 hours and he has peed and pooped 6 times in my house. I understand he is nervous because he is in a new environment. I have dog sat plenty of dogs and work in a vets office, so I understand he is nervous, but this is getting out of hand. I have met this dog in the past and he is very very sweet, so I want to help him. 

I have tried tethering the dog to me and numerous walks, but nothing helps. He doesn't give any indication that he is going to go. He just squats. My house is very open, so the only place I can gate him off is in a 12x6 area and I feel bad leaving him there for awhile, but I have him until Sunday night and can't risk him destroying the carpeting in my house. 
I've been told he has never used a wee wee pads, so that's not going to help much. I have explained the situation to his owner and was told he is sorry and that he doesn't act like this at home. I totally understand that, but it is not helping my situation right now.

922	[Fluff] Atlas and I Successfully Moved 400 Miles	"Guys! It's been a few days post-move and I'm now only semi-living out of boxes. I moved home after university as it is located close to my new job and I live in a super expensive area. The thing is, my family has been super apprehensive of Atlas. I understand. They aren't dog people, and only my mother briefly had a dog growing up. I was happy to move in on my own due to these differences, but they were kind and opened up their home/my previous home back to me and Atlas both. It's been super important that he and I make a good impression as there's a lot riding on this. Because of this, both he and I have been super stressed. This is on top of the fact that a move is inherently stressful for a dog, and my dumb fuck butt decided to move on Labor Day. 

Moving with a nearly 80 pound puppy-energy GSD is not great, so I had prepared vet-prescribed Xanax for him, a mega-chew for the road, and plenty of home smelling things. I stopped every hour and a half to do walks and exercise. I also split the drive up in to two 200 mile stretches to make it a bit easier on him. The middle point actually had a dog park in the town and I was able to do some frisbee time, which was really awesome for him. 

My anxiety was through the roof, and I could tell that he felt it too. Before we left, he had realized that all of the furniture was gone in our apartment and my mood was weird. (I was saying goodbye to my very close friend that was helping me move and I was very sad.) It didn't bode well for the drive. Expectedly, he didn't take well to being confined for that long. 

During the halfway point, he was freaking out. We were at a Best Western and he was hearing all of the outside noises. Again, labor day weekend. He barked at everything and I was really worried for what it meant for the remainder of the move. However, he did me so fucking proud when we stopped at an outdoor outlet mall to get some of his energy out. I was already fucking exhausted from driving for 5 hours only to go 150 miles after morning moving nonsense, and I expected him to be a tuggy pully nightmare due to being cooped up. I was wrong. He walked in an incredible loose leash. We weaved through the lamp-posts and he stuck right next to me. He gave me no trouble. 

The next day, we did frisbee time before we left and he was incredible for the entire ride there. I tired him out with a friend's dog before I went to my place and he socialized incredibly well. He adapted to his temporary crate quickly. He came when called despite having the chaos around him and wanting to sniff everything. God, I was so fucking proud. 

The day after, my furniture came in. The moment my bed landed on the ground, it was like he instantly understood it. ""This is home now"". He jumped right up there and dozed right off. I'm getting him used to having different people in and out of ""his place"" and ""his room"", and getting him to tolerate my family members and teaching them how to interact with one another. I've found a way to calm him when he is over-excited and barks/jumps at people he's trying to meet, and he is getting to know everybody. I've been able to increase the time he's alone and he isn't associating it with abandonment in a new place. 

Overall, he's just surprised me so much. My partner told me that he'd be perfectly fine and I had trained him for everything and prepared him as best as anyone could. I knew that, but having the daunting task before me was still so scary. He has shown me above and beyond what I could have dreamed of. God I am so proud of his little bugger that's snoozing on my lap. "	dogs

925	[Discussion] I had an unusual encounter with a dog I’d never met today.	"We decided to go to the Royal Show in our capital city today. By show, I mean an event that features livestock judging, expos and ferris wheels etc.

We decided to go and watch some dog events and judging. The area where the dogs were kept  whilst not involved in events was reasonably crowded. As my family walked past the American Staffordshire breed section, one particular dog stared at me. He paid no attention whatsoever to anyone else. He watched me intently as I walked away. When I got to the end of the aisle, I turned to see he had actually angled himself to get a better view of me. Once I got out of his line of sight, he began howling and seemed quite agitated. I walked back and he continued to watch me intently, but stopped howling. My partner and children were standing in front of him the whole time, yet he paid no attention whatsoever to them, nor anyone else.

At no time did he seem aggressive or in “guard mode”, it more seemed like he recognised me, even though I’ve never seen him before in my life. The owner even made a comment along the lines of “he seems to know you”, and was almost a bit unsettled (and very surprised), by the way he totally focussed on me and no one else (probably about 15-20 other people there).

I’ve had dogs as a part of my family all of my life and have never seen this before. Has anyone else encountered this? I can’t stop thinking about it, and feel as though I actually miss him now that I’m home!"	dogs

929	[Help] Downgrading Park Play with Smaller Dogs	So my dog is just over a year and growing up I always took him to my apartment's dog park where there is a mix of dogs of all sizes and he has always played with them appropriately, in fact he seems concerningly aloof when dog aggress on him.  He handles injured dogs gingerly and I have always been very pleased.  However, about 2 weeks ago I found a larger nearby park that splits dogs into large and small.  So he has been playing with dogs roughly his size (50-125lbs.) exclusively who wonderfully wear him out.  Yesterday I went back to our normal park and it was like all his earlier size appropriate play competency has been wiped away, he was rough with the smaller dogs suddenly knocking them down and just wanting to play wrestle with any dog there.  I was mortified as I had to hold him back and leave as he couldn't seem to play as he used to.  I'm at a loss now what to do as I don't want him to become a local pariah.	dogs
930	[help] My dog has dandruff due to allergies and we've tried everything.	"About a year ago my dog started itching a lot, even chewing off some of his fur on his sides/pelvic region and had dandruff. We've gotten everything taken care of as far as discomfort for him, no more itchy red skin, all his fur has grown back, he's generally a healthy dog, he just still has bad dandruff between his shoulders and tail.

I've tried multiple dandruff shampoos and natural remedies and nothing has seemed to work.
We've tried the following shampoos;

https://www.amazon.com/Synergy-Antiseborrheic-Antidandruff-Medicated-Shampoo/dp/B00NIVW420

and gets allergy medicine daily, as instructed by our vet

What's worked best (but not fixed) is;
Bathing 2-3 times a week with the Synergy Labs Anti dandruff shampoo (not the anti seborrheic), being fed the Nature's Recipe Healthy Skin Venison Meal and a once a week coconut oil rubdown.

I know what you're thinking ""why didn't you keep doing that?"" It stopped working.

Most recently he's been getting a bath 2-3 times a week (as per the label) with the synergy labs anti seborrheic shampoo, and being fed Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diets Dry Dog Food - Sweet Potato &amp; Bison Formula and a serving of salmon oil with every meal. I heard great things about the anti seborrheic shampoo so we decided to give it a shot and his dandruff started appearing again not even 24hrs later. We usually got at least 2 days of reprieve with every other shampoo. So i'm thinking about switching to [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0180A1CWG/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_3?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2TQUWZ1HGVSWY) shampoo, following it with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078LOU78/ref=crt_ewc_title_dp_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) leave-in conditioner, and coconut oil once a week and maybe switching dog foods again. The reason for the choice of shampoo above is because I have bad dandruff myself and [Nizoral](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=nizoral+shampoo&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Anizoral+shampoo&amp;ajr=2) cleared it up better than anything I had tried, from vinegar, lemon juice, salt scrubs, tea tree oil, etc. and the Pet Md shampoo above has the same active ingredient, Ketoconazole, that is in my shampoo, as well as sharing same ingredients to the above liked antiseptic spray, that worked wonders on his raw stomach. 

Sorry about the wall of text, but if anyone has any insight on this, i'd really appreciate it! We've been to the vet once a month for the past year and while i'm happy he's not uncomfortable anymore, i'd like to make my life easier by solving this dandruff problem. He's my best bud and I hate kicking him off the bed or couch cause of flakes. "	dogs
931	[Discussion] [Vent] Dog training and science denial (UK)	"We have a minor issue with one of the dogs. He can be a bit barky and gets over-excited about squirrels. Nothing major, but we felt it would be best to get someone to help so that we didn't accidentally reinforce the barking/excitement and turn it into actual aggression.

Looked around and picked what appeared to be a good training school. No immediate red-flags about ""Pack theory"" or ""Tellington Touch"" etc.

Trainer turns up, sees dogs' behaviour (door manners, play etc), discusses ""passive dominance"", the fact the barky one might be a bit nervous and it absolutely should be his job to ""get the door"" (it's our job) and starts to come up with a training plan involving focus training etc. We walk through some of the exercises and, barring some two-and-four legged confusions, we seem to start to get it. There was mention of ""pack leader"" and ""walking through the door first""\* to a degree, but it all seemed secondary to how (calmly) get the dog to pay attention to us rather than treat. All-in-all; so far, so good.

They then move on to discussing food where there was a bit of a push for BARF/fresh and derision of the major manufacturers like ""Mars"". This annoyed me a bit, but they weren't too pushy about it and seemed to accept that for reasons of storage (small flat) ""raw"" in any shape or form was a no-go. They did suggest a higher protein feed and the appropriate protein/crab ratios (including types) is something I'll be looking into.

The warning signs were there from they way they discussed food (extolling ""natural"" etc) but this took a turn for the worse when it came to vaccines as they came perilously close to directly advising against getting the dogs vaccinated. They claimed that their dogs hadn't been vaccinated other than as puppies they had passed various titre tests, were therefore immune and didn't need vaccines; I should speak to my vet about why our dogs needed vaccines at all (with conspiratorial eyebrow wiggling for effect).

We are not total morons, we do not over vaccinate our dogs. The dogs are not getting rabies this year because they are not going into a rabies area (we're in the UK, it's OK). For the exact same reason I no longer get various jags for hepatitis etc - I am no longer getting exposed. Although the vaccine risk is *incredibly* small, it is there; so why bung something in you don't need?

In fact, why do we bung anything into ourselves or our dogs? Because the huge body of empirical evidence we have suggests that it is best. Doctors are not stabbing me with needles because they are psychopaths and vets are not handing out vaccines like they're candy because they have secret shares in ""Big Vax"". Titres are certainly a tool to be used, but they are not the be-all-and-end-all. Evidence is what we should follow and this is the reason why the likes of the BVA have advised that some vaccinations getmoved from annually to every three or four years. Following the latest, evidence-based advice means we are (to the very best of our knowledge) maximising protection whilst minimising risk.

It just rankled that after trying to filter out the ""nutter"" trainers we got one who, whilst very good at getting the dog to do what they wanted and show us how, still went beyond their area of expertise into offering animal medical advice.

Summary: I'll take my training advice from a trainer/behaviourist, maybe even dietary advice but I'll take animal medical advice from a fully qualified vet.

932	[Discussion] Can we please go by reputable kennel club standards when recommending for or against breeds?	"I've seen it on opposite extremes with my breed (Pembroke Welsh Corgi). People either talking them up to be couch potatoes or saying they need hours of *running* per day, based on limited personal experience with either overweight neglected house dogs or excited sporting dogs at events. I've even seen people here say they're ""untrainable"" or ""very hard to train"" and when pressed will admit that's based on knowing one that was never trained; the breed standard clearly states that they are very responsive to training. Also states that they need plenty of mental stimulation and long walks/slow jogs, not forced running for long periods of time and this would actually be detrimental to their health.

I see this with pits too. Based on personal experience limited to having a one-year-old pit, sure, they're ""great with other dogs."" I've also seen people say that Great Pyrenees are ""probably easy to keep in an apartment because they're calm"" based on knowing they tend to lie around outside, and not realizing an apartment might be stressful for some livestock guardians that may feel on edge because of all the noise and activity. I could go on forever though. Most of the time, when I see a [breeds] thread, I see anecdotes outweighing breed standards. 

I would really like to see this subreddit implement some kind of rule about breed recommendations and ask that people comply with breed standards when recommending for or against a specific breed. I don't think personal experience limited to one dog or brief encounters should override breed standards. It would probably be impossible to enforce that rule, but I think it would be a good guideline for people to keep in mind."	dogs

934	[Help] Feeling guilt leaving dog at hospital after surgery for a week	"My dog tore his cruciate ligament Monday after an innocent and mundane round of fetch at the park. I took him into urgent care a few hours later and that was the diagnosis. They sent me home with pain meds and an anti-inflammatory. I had a follow up surgical consult and they verified that it was torn and he needs surgery (TPLO to be exact.)

As with most things in life, the timing couldn't be worse. We had a vacation that we're supposed to leave for Saturday that we had planned over 6 months ago. We had decided the best thing for him would be for him to stay a week at the hospital where he is getting the surgery done until we return. We don't have anyone else that can care for him, let alone take care of an animal that just got out of major surgery. I keep telling myself that this is the best thing to do, but the guilt is eating me up. I know he'll be in the best place and getting all his pain managed properly, but I still can't help worrying that he will think we had abandoned him. He gets severe anxiety anytime we are even near the vet.

Would love the input of others who have been in a similar situation or their dog has had a TPLO done. "	dogs

It ran out pretty fast so I bought a bag of Fromm Heartland Gold and after one day of eating it Cookie is having diarrhea and I'm pretty scared now. I realize it's probably because I switched his food so abruptly, but now I cant even get his old food because it's literally sold out everywhere near me.

938	[Discussion] What's the best length leash for loose-leash walking?	"So my dog is still not perfect at loose leash walking, though he's much much improved since I picked him up at year ago. I've been trying to balance still giving him plenty of freedom to sniff and explore, but also not pulling ahead and asking to go see things by sitting instead of pulling.

Anyway, today I realized that what I thought was a 6ft leash is actually a 4ft leash. I did kinda think it was short, but it never occurred to me to measure until now. Does anyone have opinions about length of leash/loose leash walking? I'm wondering if a longer lead would make it easier for him to have some freedom without running against the end of it so quickly. I'm about 5ft tall and my dog is about 1ft off the ground, if that matters.

939	[Help] Issues keeping food down	"So I have an almost 6 y/o female South African mastiff or Boerboel. She's a big girl but not overweight and deals with the usual hip issue that as most big dogs do. 

She lived in house with me till her owner left the family, he died recently and I have taken it upon myself to care for her. I've had her for about 5 months now and she had adjusted nicely. However, she seems to have an issue where she has trouble keeping her food down. She will randomly throw up. I've tried slowing her down whilst she's eating/drinking but that doesn't help. I always look out to see if she eats any weird stuff when outside but she doesn't seem to do that either other than the occasional bit of grass. 

There's no real pattern to it either. It will happen a couple times in one week but then she'll be fine for a whole month. I haven't changed anything about her diet since I got her, but it seems to be something she developed when I got her cause I don't recall her doing this when she was a puppy. She eats regular dry dog food optimised to help maintain her weight. 

I've made an appointment with my vet, just wanted to post this before I head up there to see if anyone has any tips.

941	[Help] My Collie x German Shepard suffers with separation anxiety. Will popping home on my lunches make her worse by getting her excited?	"**This isn't about separation anxiety tips. I've already looked at many suggestions so I will be trying them all over time.**

Back story (a little confusing): Millie is 4 and I got her from a lady, let's call her ""G"", who used to own her mother (the Collie) but she had to put it to sleep in May, she was old. G's friend had Millie from a puppy but G got her back thinking Millie would fill the void of her dog as Millie was its puppy. I think Millie was kept in a cage a lot (which I don't want to do at all) and G had Millie for about a month but she was too much to handle as G has 3 young kids. So long story short, my partner and I now have Millie as of yesterday and our first dog as a couple. I've had family dogs all my life but this is my first very own dog.

We both work 9-5 Mon-Fri but I only live 3 minutes from my office so I can pop home for an hour each day at lunch, either 12-1 or 1-2 to see Millie if need be.

Millie suffers with quite bad separation anxiety as I have a webcam I have been checking in on her. She will whine and howl for hours with the odd rest in between but doesn't seem to be eating yet. I know it's all very new to her so the stress won't help and I expect her to eat better as time goes on.

Now back to my main reason for posting. Millie will sometimes rest by the door when she's not crying or howling and I feel like the more she relaxes the better. Will going home on my lunch to spend an hour with her or walk her only make her worse as she will get all excited again that I'm back or will it help over time, even if she does initially start crying again?

I know every dog is different so not expecting a black and white, yes or no answer."	dogs
942	[Discussion] Apartment dogs vs house dogs	"Stop telling people in apartments that they can't get a big/high energy dog. In my experience I've noticed apartment dogs with no backyard space get way more exercise than dogs who have a backyard. I've found that backyard dogs are just let out there and get a few 15 minute walks a day while apartment dogs are taken out for runs and get to go to the dog park since the owners don't think their home is big enough for them. 

Dogs mostly just sleep at home or chew on their toys anyways if they get enough exercise and stimulation. If you want to get a dog who needs a lot of exercise but you live in an apartment, don't let this discourage you. If you're actively working your dog and giving him/her the proper time and attention they need then you'll be fine. "	dogs
943	[Help] My puppy has giardia. How do I prevent my other dog from getting it?	"Mona (3 months) hasn't showed any symptoms, so this is a big surprise. At our last puppy check up, the vet told us to bring in a stool sample when we could. Yesterday happened to be that day. Today the vet called and said her stool tested positive for giardia so my fiance is at the vet picking up her medication and bringing in my other dog, Theo's, stool to be tested.

We live in an apartment building so we don't have a yard. There is a small dog park in our complex where we take both dogs to go potty and we walk them around the complex. Mona tries to eat every thing in sight, so i think it is how she could've picked up the disease. She'll bite the grass/dirt and I will instantly take it out of her mouth. Theo doesn't eat anything off the ground.

Anyway, is there a way for us to prevent it spreading besides picking up her poop which we already do? Should I wash all surfaces of the apartment? She will nap in bed with us on our comforter and sheets, pillowcases, so I already plan on washing those. But should I mop the floor with diluted bleach? She hasn't pooped in the house (and when she does it's on the wee wee pad thankfully).

I'd appreciate all input, comments, etc. I'm just a ball of stress right now. Plus, I'm a big hypochondriac so I'm worried that we humans could get it from her too."	dogs
944	[RIP] Fluffy, Poodle Mutt, 13	"I finally got around to painting him. I couldn’t finish, because I just started crying.

He passed away months ago. I was away in college, across the country, and my family didn’t tell me until I came back home. I got the news in an In-N-Out drive through, where I got out of the car and started sobbing as I tried to get as far away as possible.

The car followed me for a mile. I was scream-crying the whole time... not my proudest moment.

He was such a good boy. I honestly have never met another dog like him. He was so intelligent. He was funny. He was my best friend.

When he couldn’t walk up the stairs anymore, I carried him up to my bed, every day. That stopped when I left for college. Apparently he’d wait outside empty bathrooms when I was gone, hoping I’d come out... I just wish I could have spent his last year with him. I really do. He loved my family, so much, but he was always “my dog.” I don’t mean that in a selfish way, and I know my family loved him just as much, but I understood him, and he understood me.

I’ve just been staring at this half-finished painting for the last hour. If he was here, he’d lick the tears off my face. He liked the salt. But he never left me while I was crying. My family’s current dogs are less intuitive about that. I don’t blame them for it, and I still love them. But Fluffy was so special. He was my world.

I wish I had one last day to say goodbye.

945	[Vent] Neighbors' lack of training their huge dogs jeopardizes my every effort to make my timid rescue less scared of big dogs.	"I was hoping I'll never have to vent in here, but here it comes.

I've had my rescue for roughly 6 weeks. She came in terrified, not trusting anyone, but she's making incredible progress and I'm insanely proud of her. One of the remaining issue is that she's sometimes very afraid of bigger dogs, which is not surprising at all, since she's the size of a dachshound.

We have a lot of medium and large dogs in the neighborhood, so we're making a conscious effort to get her used to them. It's not that difficult - we make brief greetings at first, we pet the other dog to show our girl that it's all fine, we give her treats after the encounters. It's working and so far she's actually befriended a good amount of medium and large dogs in the neighborhood, including a huuuuge Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, so it's not like I'm biased and she's just unreasonably afraid of all large dogs and it cannot be helped. She's really a trooper and it really doesn't take much to change her attitude.

The particular problematic group is a family of three sled dogs that hang out **unleashed** in the only larger green spot in the area (**not** a dog park, a public space) for at least an hour during the afternoon, so it's actually impossible to avoid them. I actually like **them** (the dogs) and they're pretty friendly, but their owners make me want to scream. The dogs are completely unruly, and they don't listen to their owners at all, nor are the owners making any effort to teach them anything. I also highly suspect that they don't have enough space and excercise. I mean, the target demographic for the neighborhood are students and young couples with 1-2 kids. Doesn't sound like there are a lot of flats available that are enough for two adults and three giant sled dogs, especially if you walk them once a day (and if the idea of a walk is standing in the middle of a park waiting for them to run off their energy on their own).

When they run to greet us it's like a cavalcade or the stampede scene from the Lion King. My dog (leashed, as she's a fresh rescue and we were recommended to keep her leashed) understandably starts to run away, often even whimpering. The owners then try to call them back (but never approach, they're always standing in the same spot, chatting and waiting for the dogs to get tired so they can go home), but the dogs just won't listen and they corner my dog to sniff her and force her to play with them. I'm seeing them almost every day and I've never seen them actually get succesfully called back. Hell, they actually listen to me more than to them, as sometimes I can make them ""go away"" with a firm command.

And I can't even try to avoid them by passing them by from a distance, because when they see other dogs they run off 150+ yards from their owners (and the whole park is not much bigger than that). What kind of owner has their dog run off so far and does not bat an eye, hardly attempting to call them back and not approaching if calling failed? What if it wasn't my skittish mutt, but some large, reactive, agressive dog?

I managed to do the ""calm greeting routine"" with them only once, when one of them was sick so they'd walk them separately. When each is alone, they don't frolic just as much.

The result so far is that my dog is a) afraid of all dogs that look similar to them and b) doesn't want to go to the park (again, it's **not** a **dog** park, it's a regular green public square) if she sees them from a distance and I honestly just want to go there and give those people a piece of mind. I tried to intervene a couple of times by simply asking them to call off their unleashed, unruly dogs from my leashed and terrified one, but they make a few attempts to call them off and then just give up and go back to chatting and smoking. I'm seriously debating just yelling at the dogs to stay back every time and not letting them come near.

I also know for a fact that my girl is not the only dog to be so terrified of them. I've seen plenty of dogs that are way bigger than mine who run away from them. And the street is not **that** far away. One of these days some properly scared dog will get ran over trying to escape from them.

Just don't be that owner, guys. If you have large dogs, teach them to behave. Do not let them terrorize the whole neighborhood with their frolicking and for everyone's sake, do not let them run around everywhere unattended."	dogs

What's more important is how your treat, raise, train your dog."	dogs
947	[Help] Amimal Clinic killed my dog	"So to start off, my pit is my entire world, I’m sure many of you can relate. I went to get her spayed. She was dropped off at 10AM, and they told me they would call me around noon to give me an update. They called at 12:30 saying the procedure went well and that I can pick her up later that day. I was about to pick her up after work and I received a call at 4:30 saying there were some complications and that I should leave her there over night and check in the next morning. I asked if they have someone there to watch over night and they said no, they were about to close shop for the day.

I rush to the Animal Hospital and when I get there, she can barely raise her head off the table. I take her to an emergency clinic and they immediately order her 3 pints of blood saying she’s bleeding out and needs a transfusion. They tried everything they could but she passed.

Looking over the paperwork from the first clinic they made notes at 1pm saying she needed a transfusion but didn’t do anything about it. They waited hours to call me and inform me but by that time it was too late. 

I have paperwork from the first clinic saying they knew at 1pm but did not inform me. I have a statement from the 2nd clinic saying if they knew hours earlier, she could have saved her. She also said she would appear in court for me if needed.

My friend posted my story on Facebook and it started to getting shared. The clinic responded to my friends to not leave them negative reviews. Looking at their reviews and I can find at least 4 similar stories.

Can anyone help me with advice? What are my options? Thank you!"	dogs
948	[Discussion] Dog doesn’t get up in morning or go out for 12+ hours. Okay?	"My 12 yo mixed breed (maybe a Carolina Dog) - doesn’t get up and come downstairs in the morning anymore. Has been going on for several months. She is happy and healthy - lots of energy when she is up and greets the kids when they come from school at 3pm. But from 9pm (after her last outing) until then, she doesn’t get off the bed or come downstairs. She might take a drink of water but that’s it. She just sleeps and snuggles from evening until afternoon. 

When i let her out she doesn’t rush to pee or poop - just sniffs around and finally does her business. 

She seems to have some weakness in her back legs - but runs and plays normally when she is up. 

Question is: should i force her to get up n the morning and go out? Is there any danger in not watering her for 12+ hours ? 

Thanks!! "	dogs
949	[Help] Newly Adopted 3 year old doesn't fully release bladder	"We adopted a 3 year old pit bull mix just over a week ago. We take her out on average 3 times per day, and she'll pee a little bit and move on.

950	[help][UPDATE] am I over or underreacting to my dogs needs?	"About 3 weeks ago I made this post

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/97ws6n/help_am_i_over_or_underreacting_to_my_dogs_needs/

Just wanted to update everyone, as I really appreciated all the advice. Over the last 19 days, I’ve missed 3 days of getting her out and about. One of the days, she honestly just slept on the couch all day because we had done a ton of stuff the day before. The other two days, well I’m not perfect. 

We have been walking a lot more. The walks are about half an hour typically, but a couple times a week they are more like an hour and a half if it’s nice out and I’m feeling up to it. I just let her go wherever she wants, and sniff around. Some days instead of a walk I bring her to the park on a 30ft leash that I purchased, where we play frisbee with one of those Kong flyers. Man, they really go far. 

If it’s too hot, which it has been a few of the days, I take her swimming or we simply go to the pet store. Usually there are other customers there with their dogs so she gets to say hi to them too. The employees give her some treats and love on her and I buy her some kind of chew for when we get home. She also walks around the store sniffing everything and exploring. She gets so excited in the car when she realizes that’s where we’re going now.  

I got her a licky mat off amazon which she likes, and we still play with a balloon for 20 min or so every night, which is her favorite thing ever and gets her panting good. I also still do nose work in the house with her, and actually I’ve rearranged some furniture which made the game fresh again as there are new hiding spots. 

I am glad I am doing more with her and I know she enjoys it, and I have no plans to stop, but I don’t notice much difference in her. She still wants to nap in the bedroom instead of be out in the living room with me if I’m working, she still doesn’t want to play in the backyard (although after coaxing her back there with lots of cheese, she will at least potty back there again), and she still stares at me as if I’m supposed to be entertaining her 24/7. Lol. So I don’t know. I probably am still not meeting all of her exercise needs, but I gotta start somewhere and this has definitely been a big improvement. I am trying to just keep this routine up for a bit and then I am going to start adding in a 2nd daily walk before dinner. 

Anyway, thanks again for all of the advice. If you can think of any more things I could do to entertain/exercise my dog, please let me know.

952	[RIP] Toby, Chocolate Lab, 13.5	"I just found out from my parent's that my first dog, Toby, has passed away today. We aren't exactly sure what happened, but over the last few months his health was starting to decline. He got a clean bill of health from the vet in July, but today he fell and couldn't get up. Had a high fever. Something else was going on and the vet didn't think he would make it through the night, so they made the decision. 

[Here is one of my favourite recent pictures](https://imgur.com/a/vPlPO4K) I know it's horrible quality, but I love this picture because even though he's about 12.5 in this picture, his face looks just like it did when he was a puppy.

I have severe anxiety, and have literally my entire life. I have ALWAYS loved dogs, and begged my parents for a dog every chance I got. Finally, in 2005 when I was 13, my parents got me Toby. He came from a great breeder who I still keep in touch with today. 

So many people warned my parents not to get a dog, because I would 'grow out of it' or 'get bored of him when he's not a puppy' - but that never happened. I loved that dog, I did everything with that dog, and he literally saved me when my anxiety was at its absolute worst. 

When I got married and moved out, we knew it wouldn't make sense for me to take him with me due to my living situation (at the time I was renting a small basement apartment) and the fact that he was starting to have health problems. 

Still, even though I have 'my own' dog now - Toby was still my boy. My first dog. It feels very weird that he's gone. He was a psycho right until the end - he caught and swallowed live birds WHOLE, stole socks at every moment he could get, never settled outside of his crate until he was like, 8 years old, chewed through ""indestructible"" toys within minutes and yet was somehow the most gentle, sensitive dog ever. 

I will miss him.

I'm bringing home a German Shorthaired Pointer puppy in less than two weeks. I'm excited to work with another high energy breed, and her middle name will definitely be Toby.  "	dogs

I am in search of my dog, Maggie who spooked and got away from me Sunday night while backpacking at Mohawk lake in the High Uintas.

&amp;#x200B;

Maggie, a 60 lb black and white lab mix, went missing during our backpacking trip to Mohawk lake in the high Uintas Sunday night around 8:30 pm. We were hiking back to our camp which was about .5 of a mile above Mohawk lake. The group stopped for a short second to decide which direction to go and within that short second, Maggie was gone. We think she smelt or saw something and got spooked. We searched all night around the lake and our camp. We also searched above the lake Monday. Yesterday, we did a 16 mile day hike which included the hike to where the camp site was, around the entire perimeter of Mohawk lake, and further into the woods. I’ve left my clothes and some of her toys around the area in hopes that she would be able to smell those scents. At this point, I would be so appreciative if people could share this post in hopes that a camper or hiker would keep an eye out for her. We began at Grandview trail to Grandaddy lake then continued on past Betsy lake and then stopped at Mohawk lake. Maggie has her tag and collar on where my phone number and address can be found. Maggie is so sweet and not aggressive but may be a little apprehensive when first approached.Crouching down to her level is the best way to get her to come to you. She loves people but she especially loves other dogs."	dogs

Background: 
- Got her at 11 wks, weighed 6-7 lbs. 
- Took her to the vet at 13 wks and she was 7.4 lbs and vet was not worried about her size as she looked healthy. We also have vet records at 7 weeks from her vaccinations, so we know she's about the right age.
- She's now about 15 weeks and weighs about 8 lbs (no scale, just a guess), she's an inch taller.
She eats just over a cup of kibble a day. She is super active when she's playing and a little bullet! 

The person we got her from guessed she'll be about 45 lbs (which is really small for both those breeds) . We did not see the parents, however looking at photos of Boxadors as puppies, she looks exactly like the photos. "	dogs
958	My doggy is sick, vet says he has a herniated disc [HELP]	My dog has had a history of pain in his hind limbs. At first I thought he hurt himself since he is very playful, likes to run and jump and so I took him to the vet and the vet gave him a shot for the pain. But then I noticed he would have the same pain a couple times throughout the year and this vet just kept giving him shots for the pain. I can tell when my doggy is sick because he isn’t as playful, he just lays in bed and doesn’t even like to be petted (and he’s usually very demanding about being petted). When he is in pain he gets tachycardic, breathing heavy and if I try to carry him he yelps in pain. I left him this morning just fine and when I came back he was basically dragging his hind limbs. I took him to the ER and the vet says he has a herniated disc, needs surgery and doesn’t know if my doggy will be able to walk again after surgery. I know my dog would not be happy if he couldn’t walk again and I am just in a tough place right now. The surgery is very expensive and I took my dog my home against medical advice. Tomorrow morning I will be taking him to see another vet to get a second opinion and see if a more conservative approach is possible and if surgery is absolutely necessary what are the chances of my sweet boy walking again. 	dogs

961	[help] Adopting a dog, does the dog miss its previous owner forever?	"Hi guys, Im adopting a dog from a private adoption (owner cant care for him and needs to rehome him).  He is a chihuahua terrier mix abt 10 years old.  I met up with the dog and the dog was friendly with me but clearly loves the current owner alot.  I would like to add that the dog has separation anxiety, apparently he whines and barks when the owner steps out.  He was also adopted by the current owner from the pound. So if you include me, this would be the dogs 3rd or 4th rehoming in his life- and i suspect this is the cause of the anxiety in the dog.
My question is will the dog have an extremely hard time adjusting to his new home with me? I imagine it must be quite traumatizing for the dog to go home with us and never see the owner again (especially since he already has seperation anxiety and has gone through this multiple times in his life).  Is there anything I can do to relieve this? and will the dog end up looking for his old owner forever? I never want to rehome him again but I love him so much and it'll break my heart to see the dog suffer emotionally.

I am worried he will not love me as much as well, because Im just a stranger ""ripping"" him away from the person he loves.

966	[HELP][Discussion] Snake/wildlife avoidance training - trying to keep precious idiot puppy from killing himself (pics)	"**TLDR:** **Does anyone have any experience with snake/wildlife avoidance classes?** All the ones in our entire state (Texas) use the negative e-collar method - see a snake, get zapped a couple times, done. We've never used negative training but can't find another way of doing it anywhere near us. Given the prevalence of nasty snakes here, it could be life or death for our 22 pound dog.

Story:

We have an 8 month old, 22 pound Cavalier in north Texas (Dallas). As it cools under 100 degrees, it's become outdoor season again for us.

Last night, doggo is happily trotting on his leash like a good boy and then BAM! He whips around and tries jumping onto a *giant tarantula*. GIANT. See pic - 4+ inches across. Even if it didn't kill him, it would have resulted in a bad day and a $$$ vet bill.

I realized later that had that been a snake - we have rattlers, copperheads, cottonmouths, etc - we would have been in *real* trouble. Doggo has a good ""leave it"" command for normal things we see in the city, but he pounced before I even saw it or could have said the words. We're working on his ""leave it"" and mild prey drive, but there's no way I can promise myself I'll see the next spider or snake before he does. We will spend the next several months practicing attention and leave its, but I'm worried our next encounter will be before we can solidify that training - last month we saw a green snake and scorpion in our dog park in the city.

So if traditional leave it/attention training is slow and imperfect, and snakes are a real threat here, I'm left with one option: snake avoidance classes. All the classes in our state use negative shock collar methods to teach dogs ""snakes hurt"". I understand they only zap the dog a couple times and the dog then leaves snakes alone. I'd like to enroll him in one of these classes, but I'm less than confident in straying from the positive-only training that's worked so well before. I'm hoping, too, that having a ""negative"" experience with a snake will help him be less eager to mess with Mr. Tarantula next time. **Thoughts? Anyone successfully trained their dog to not antagonize venomous wildlife? Anyone taken one of these snake avoidance classes?**

967	Please [HELP] dog having incontinence issues. Don’t know what to do?	"Hey guys I have a Male 3 year old German Shepherd. He weighs around 90lbs and was diagnosed with MRSP skin infection a few months ago. His dermatologist recommended topical treatment (maleseb shampoo, followed by a bleach solution that we sponge on. 2oz of bleach in a gallon of water). We’ve followed this protocol and the infection has cleared up, however about 3-4 weeks into treatment Thor developed incontinence. 

He would never squat in the house, or purposely urinate, but while laying down some would dribble out, or even just while he was walking. We stopped the bathing for about 2 weeks and the urinary problems stopped. Then when we started the baths again, the urinary problems came back. We stopped the baths one more time for about 3 weeks and the urinary issues stopped again. Now that we’ve started the baths again, the urinary issues came back. 

I took him to my primary vet, they did a urinary culture, and urinalysis. Both came back perfect. So she believes it’s the baths possible causing prepuce irritation (balantitis) which can cause urinary incontinence, but Thor’s dermatologists doesn’t think it’s the baths. 

Thor has always had an issue sticking his penis out, and has even been to the ER before because it was stuck out for about an hour. He gets more than normal amount of discharge, the color is yellowish, slightly green? And his penis swells sometimes and other times seems normal. The urinary incontinence comes and goes. He can go 2 weeks without any issues, and then suddenly leak twice in a day. Then be fine again for a few days, then maybe leak for two days. 

My question is, does this seem like prepuce irritation (balantitis) or does this sound like something else? Thanks guys, I appreciate any help.

TLDR: Dog has been having occasion incontinence issues, yellowish/slightly green discharge, and penis is out all the time. Urinary culture and urinalysis came back normal. Dog has no issue holding his bladder all night, or during the day while I’m at work. "	dogs

971	[Help] Getting a puppy and potentially entering the Conformation world. Should I do this?	"I need help deciding if this is an opportunity I should pursue or if I'm being ridiculous. Thanks for any advice you can provide!

My husband and I were on the waitlist for a litter of golden retrievers and we found out this weekend that we would not be getting a puppy. I have been emailing and calling other breeders like crazy this week trying to find another litter, and I happened to stumble on an opportunity that seems almost too good to be true. I need help deciding if this is a good idea or if I am not thinking clearly due to my grief.

A reputable breeder has a litter of puppies that is 4 weeks old with one female that is not spoken for. She was planning to keep this female for her breeding program, but she is no longer able to do so. She is looking for a home that will be willing to return the dog to her for breeding at 2.5 years of age. I would be able to keep a puppy from the litter, or I would be reimbursed the cost of a puppy. After that, the owner can choose to spay the dog or continue breeding her (she’s selling her on full registration). She would also prefer to place the dog in a home that would show her in Conformation, because she feels that this dog will be special.

I am a complete novice to dog breeding and Conformation shows but I am genuinely intrigued. I’ve always been tepidly interested in the competitive dog world but it seemed very weird and intimidating. Maybe this is my chance to give it a shot.

All of the breeding and birthing would be handled by the breeder, I would just have to be willing to part with my dog for 7 weeks. After that, I am fairly certain I would have her spayed, because I am not interested in breeding dogs myself.

In terms of Conformation, the breeder would show the dog for me (grooming, handling, transportation) and I would have the option of participating if I wanted to. I would still be expected to do basic conformation training on my own time. I live in an area with lots of regional shows, so I would be able to attend most events and see my dog compete. Unlike the breeding agreement, I would be under no contractual obligation to continue showing my dog.

I called and spoke with another dog owner who has a similar arrangement with this breeder. She had wonderful things to say about the whole experience. According to her, the toughest part is having to be away from your dog for 7 weeks after the birth. She said that the costs are reasonable, that the shows are fun, and that it’s a nice community.

Below, I’ve written out the pros and cons of this whole arrangement.

Reasons this would be great idea:

1. My puppy and I would have a goal and purpose in our training.
2. My dog would get to go on fun and stimulating adventures outside of my house.
3. As a first time puppy owner, I would have an experienced mentor.
4. I would have a new community of people with a common interest.
5. It would be really cool to see my dog go through a pregnancy and be a mommy.
6. All of the other litters I have found with unreserved spots won’t be born until later this fall or winter, and I have a genuine fear that the same thing will happen and I will be without a dog for another 6 months.
7. This is a show quality dog, so it should be really beautiful and have a good temperament.

Reasons why I should not do this:

1. I would have to be separated from my dog for 7 weeks when she gives birth and for 2-5 days at a time when she is competing. That may be super depressing, or it may be a nice chance to go on vacation and know that my dog is still in good hands.
2. What if I decide I hate dog shows? Would I feel super guilty if I just didn’t want to show my dog anymore?
3. The breeder is located about 2 hours away from me, so there will be a lot of driving involved in this arrangement.
4. What if there are unexpected costs and this becomes a very expensive new hobby?

I apologize for how long this post is. I tried to make it shorter, but there is a lot of information involved. Any thoughts or insights would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Offered a show quality golden puppy if I am willing to return dog to breeder at 2.5 years to breed. Breeder also wants to show the dog in Conformation for me. I’m a total novice, is this a good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: minor typos

EDIT 2: removed extra whitespace

EDIT 3: Answering Questions and providing Update

**Q: Are there other contingencies to this breeding?** 

A: The breeder said she would only breed her if she passes all health screenings and clearances. If she doesn't turn out to be a good breeding candidate then the whole breeding arrangement is a moot point. 

**Q: Who would be responsible for the breeding costs?**

A: The breeder would cover all breeding related costs. In exchange for letting her breed my dog, I would be reimbursed with a puppy or the cost of a puppy. 

UPDATE:

Thank you to everyone who has chimed in here! You have given me lots to think about. It seems like this sort of arrangement is not unusual or unethical. I think the breeder genuinely wants to give this puppy to a good home without forfeiting the ability to breed and show her if she turns out to be special. I'm just not sure I want to commit to the whole process and sacrifice autonomy over the care of the dog.

I am still talking to other breeders and I have found a male puppy that is available to go home next month. If I can get that puppy, then I will take it. This dog is from a line of field trial dogs, so I may try to get involved with that type of competition. The original breeder - whose litter didn't work out - competes in field trials, so I may see if she would be interested in mentoring me."	dogs
972	[Help] Quality of life for a deaf/blind dog?	"Sorry for the incoming wall of text. Relative for me, anyway, this is a rather long post. TL;DR: I'm wondering if we need to consider putting our dog down after he recently went blind.

Our Loki, a miniature dachshund, is 13 years old and has had a rough last couple years. It started with a small bump on his neck that continued to grow until it was a bit bigger than a golf ball. We had it looked at by a vet who said it didn't appear to be cancer but was instead just a fatty cyst. It was unpleasant to look at but didn't seem to be causing him any pain, so we just left it. Then his left eye started getting cloudy suddenly, which eventually led to us having to remove his left eye. He got through that surgery like a champ, so when his cyst started coming loose and flopping about while he was running, the vet advised that we remove it just to preclude the possibility of it getting caught or torn on anything. All was good for a few months after that, but it soon became apparent that Loki could barely hear anymore. We'd have to shout to get his attention, and he stopped alerting us to people at the door. Now, just within the last couple days, he seems to have gone completely blind. He's still a very happy dog, by every indication that I know of, but I'm worried about his quality of life. With hearing and sight gone, will he be able to find his food and water OK? He still knows to do his business if we carry him outside and place him in the grass, so that's not a huge issue right now, but I'm just wondering if we need to start preparing to put him down.

Thank you for any help you can y'all can offer."	dogs

974	[Help] [Discussion] When is a dog ‘yours’? Can you help me decide what’s best for a dog I wish I could adopt but probably can’t? I’m very torn :( Long post, tried to explain as best I could.	"Hi, asking for help here bc I can’t think of a more suitable sub but pls direct me to better one if need be :) 

So my first question is in the title and I guess it’s a slightly philosophical one. But in all practicality, what are the dead giveaways that a dog is bonded or has an affinity to one human in particular?

The reason I ask is that I’ve been walking a dog at my local shelter as a volunteer for about 3 weeks and have fallen in love with her. She was troubled, had to work really hard to earn her trust. But every day I kept encouraging her a bit more and she had gotten to the stage of seeing me and doing butt wiggles/tail wagging and pawing at the kennel door, tippy taps. And even though she was very shy and a bit ‘walled in’, she would give me hearty face and nose licks and listen to all my commands finally. 

I was seriously thinking of adopting her. The only thing stopping me is my house and yard not being absolutely perfect for her, given that she is an anxious Staffy/pit who likes to dig under fences. I would have her in a heartbeat if my property was 100% secure. 

So I had resigned myself to at least being able to hang out with her on walks at the shelter, and giving her the best company and love possible while in that environment waiting for a new home (best case scenario, can’t think of the worst it’s too sad). 

I went in there to see her three days ago and she wasn’t there. I feared she had been euthanised and wanted to cry. I didn’t ask the shelter staff where she had gone, because I didn’t want to hear bad news. I just hoped like hell that she had been taken home by some good people who would love her and spoil her silly. Tried to think positive but had said goodbye to her in my head. I missed her so so so much it’s crazy.

So when I finally got the courage to ask about her today when I was there to walk other pups, I was amazed to hear that she was still there! Just moved to a different section of the complex where volunteers don’t see! Such a happy relief to know she was still around. 

Now my second question is: after not having seen her for a few days, having let go of the idea of ever seeing her again, and finding out I could see her tomorrow if I wanted....should I? 

Will it be upsetting and stressful for her to see me visiting and not taking her home if we have bonded enough for wiggly butt and face licks? Would it be easier to let her be, and not see her again?

Sorry this is long, hope it makes sense. Thank you for reading if you did :) 

TL;DR - Bonded with shelter dog I can’t practically adopt but want to visit her and make her days in shelter happy, unsure if this is the right thing to do in case it makes her more anxious?

975	[Discussion] UV light showing so many urine spots! Questions...	"Hi all, I'm working on potty training my 12 week old labradoodle. Recently, I bought a UV light cause I was sure I was missing some of the spots she stealthily peed in. And things are going much better with strict tethering.

However, I want my carpet clean and to avoid my puppy peeing in the same spots again.

Do I need to treat the spots until they don't show up on UV light or just until they don't smell or are visible in daylight? 

On spots I didn't notice til they were dry, do you recommend enzyme cleaner, regular cleaner, vinegar, or something else? So far I've been using the Biokleen Bac-Out enzyme cleaner, but again, am worried cause there are still black light spots after using sometimes.

Thanks!

He is deaf, just underwent surgery for an ACL repair, has had eye surgery, has arthritis and spinal degeneration.  He's actually doing okay and we have his pain under control. For the first time since he was a pup, he ignored my drop it command this weekend.  He picked up a bone he wasn't supposed to have, saw me make the drop it sign, ignored it and clenched it tight in his jaw when I attempted to take it out of his mouth. After all he's been through, I think he's entitled to be a little ornery but he is also barking for attention which he never did.  On one hand, I don't want him to develop bad habits but on the other, when I am in my 70s, I hope no one is sweating the small stuff.  Thoughts?	dogs

When we got home he immediately laid down and didn't even get up to drink water; he drinks from his bowl while still laying down. He also wouldn't eat his dinner.

On the car ride back he wouldn't look at me (I feel like he felt betrayed by me), but today it's the same. On his morning walk he was lagging far behind and would sometimes stop in the middle of walking to lie down. He didn't greet me when I came home from work and his breathing was heavy, sulking almost. Is he still mad at me, or is this something else I should be worried about?

984	[Help] My guy has inexplicably stopped finishing his food.	"He's a 3-4 year old Chow, weighs about 44 pounds. He's a rescue that we've had about four months now. 

A couple days ago he stopped finishing his food. He always eats some but then leaves about 1/2 - 1/3rd. I haven't noticed any other behavior change and his stool seems normal. There haven't been any big changes in his home life in the last couple days either- no change in food, schedule, or environment. It seems completely random.

He will eat if we hand feed him (something we obviously unwilling to do all the time). The first time we put a little peanut butter with what remained and he gobbled it up (I've since read we should not be doing that as it may encourage him to hold out for it on purpose so we won't be doing that again either).

His last Vet appointment was maybe a month ago and all was normal. He's up to date on his shots. He is taking some medication with his food for heartworms but he's been on it for almost three weeks and it's never been a problem so I don't think that's it (honestly he never even seems to notice it).

Obviously if this continues we will take him back to the vet but I wanted to see if anyone else had some insight first.

USA, Texas. He eats Kirklands brand Salmon/Sweet Potato (has been eating this for months never been a problem).

Any ideas?"	dogs
985	[Fluff] A story from when I was a volunteer at the SPCA	"Back in high school I was a volunteer at my local SPCA, which meant I spent a few hours every weekend walking and playing with the dogs at the shelter. When I started there was one dog in particular that had already been there for about six months, she was a bigger dog and didn’t get along well with other dogs or most people. I tried to spend time with her every weekend, and became pretty attached to this dog. One weekend I came in and she was gone, someone had decided to adopt her and all the staff was ecstatic about it.

She was back in before the end of the month, the owner said they just couldn’t handle her attitude. It’s not unheard of, but it was really sad to see her come back in. Her attitude problems started to get worse after coming back in, and several more months passed. Then one day we had a man come in to look at adopting, and this dog goes NUTS. Turns out this guy had been deployed a year prior, and had to hand her over to the SPCA because he didn’t have anyone who could watch her for a year. There were a lot of tears, he left with her very shortly after and we never saw her again"	dogs

But when I was playing with him not so long ago, he had what looked like a seizure but my parents still did not want to take him to the vet. Apparently this disease is supposed to go away in a couple of days, and none of these symptoms have been repeating except that his breathing has gotten really fast and loud. He also responds to things slower now and I am really worried because he has never been like this before. I don't know if it is because he has aged or because there's something else going on.

990	[Help] Dog I'm looking after growls at me while coming closer and wagging her tail?	"Hey! I'm currently dogsitting four dogs for a friend, and I've run into some confusing behaviour. One of them, a border collie, will come up to me while I'm just sitting down, and she'll wag her tail, but if I pet her after a while she'll start growling. Usually if a dog growled at me I wouldn't approach them, so it's super confusing to me that she actively comes closer. It's not even in an especially aggressive way, she'll literally climb into my lap and push closer to me while growling. She doesn't look at me though, and if I tell her off or try to push her away she growls louder and braces herself, which makes me kind of nervous.
She still wags her tail through all this, but it's like swishing, not full on excited wagging. She's quite a big dog, certainly too big for a lap dog, so having a big growling thing on your knee isn't the best for confidence. I thought at first it was because of the other dogs coming over so she got jealous, but she's definitely growling at me as she does it when it's just the two of us.

I don't understand why she's growling, and why she continues to come over to me and cuddle up if she's just gonna growl. She's super sweet and hasn't snapped at me or anything, but I feel like there must be something behind this weird behaviour.
Thanks for any help."	dogs
991	[Help] Compulsive Behavior	"I am writing for a friend. Her family has two French Bulldogs. Both female and about 4 years old. One is completely normal. The other, Charlie, compulsively 'bops' the ground with her front paws while staring down, as if she sees something she is trying to get at or dig up.

This behavior is daily. This behavior is all day. When she's not sleeping, eating, briefly playing or briefly purposely being distracted, she's right back to the behavior. She works herself up panting doing this. I know it's not necessarily harmful but it has to be mentally exhausting and completely abnormal.

My friend said previous vets said it was reminiscent of 'fly snapping syndrome'. They didn't seem to have any suggestions though.

Any advice would be helpful. It's heartbreaking to watch.

992	[Help] My Dog is anxious.	"My husband and I have 3 dogs. One is a 7-year old rescue, Katie. She is our first and oldest dog. We also have another rescue, Ellie, and a German Shepherd, Deacon. Ellie came from some super crappy owners. I found her locally and fell in love with her picture. I offered quite a bit of money for her, and her owners told me she had been vaccinated. This, unfortunately, was a lie. A few weeks after we brought her home, she got hookworms. We took her to the emergency clinic, where she stayed a few nights and ultimately recovered. But because of her illness, we had to quarantine her for several weeks. This was during her socialization period as a puppy. Her only exposure to other dogs was Our other dog, Katie. As a result, she became very attached to Katie and extremely fearful of other dogs. We took her to a behaviorist for private sessions, and she is also now on doggie Prozac. We have worked on introducing her to other dogs and people incredibly slowly. We were told that we may never see huge strides of progress, but my goal was to make her more comfortable, and I believe she is. 

We used to keep our dogs in kennels when we left the house for extended periods. Mostly because Ellie used to have extreme separation anxiety and shred everything in sight. Keeping her in a large
Kennel with Katie seemed to keep her calm. Recently, though, we decided to give them a try out on their own. So we left them out while we went out for a bit. We came back and everything was fine. The issue is that now when we do that, Ellie goes into the bathroom and stays the entire time we are gone. Ive tried giving her a special toy to comfort her while we are away, but the thought of her lying on the bathroom floor out of fear bothers me. Does anyone have suggestions of how to make her more comfortable in our house? I don’t know if shutting the bathroom door is a good option because I don’t want to traumatize her by taking away her safe space. 

Suggestions welcome! "	dogs

That's happened before so I didn't think too much of it. I thought she would just either not eat yesterday or eat unenthusiasticly (what she usually does when her stomach makes noises) and she'd be feeling better the next day. Yesterday she ate her dinner unenthusiasticly (she finished her food but she didn't lick her bowl clean) and nothing looked too unusual until she had loose bloody stool, but that happened after hours so I didn't call the vet. Right before and after the bloody stool she looked pretty uncomfortable, but I'm not sure if she was lethargic or not because she still had enough energy to bark like crazy and chase squirrels despite how bad she looked like she was feeling. Do lethargic dogs bark and chase squirrels? Anyway, she looks like she's feeling better today, she looks happier, so maybe she can wait for a normal vet appointment instead of seeing an emergency vet today? Should I take her to the emergency vet today or can she wait for her normal vet appointment?

She's 11(?) years old and spayed. She's a mutt, possibly a Pomeranian Chihuahua mix. She's a little chubby at 13 lbs. Even though she's 11 and a little chubby she was still really healthy, she hasn't slowed down at all ever since I adopted her when she was 2, but to be fair she's always been a low energy dog, not a hyper bone in her body. But these little dogs live forever."	dogs

997	[Help] My dog bites if I try to take away a tissue from his mouth?	"So I have a cockapoo that is about a year and half old. We noticed about 3 months ago that he started getting very possessive over tissues. This ONLY happens with tissues and no other item. If he manages to grab a tissue out of the garbage, he seems to lock into the tissue as if his life depends on it. If I tell him to drop it he will just sit there with his jaw locked. If I try to get it out of his mouth by even slowly trying to pry it loose, he gives a warning growl and if you continue then he eventually nips.

I want to preface the following by saying it was my fault and I knew he would probably do this: last night he grabbed a tissue out of the garbage and half of it was sticking out of his mouth. I held onto that part and slowly tried wiggling it out of his mouth. He wasn't growling at all so I thought maybe he wouldn't do what he normally does. The second I tried pulling it out by force, he bit my finger and blood started gushing out. When he saw that he immediately dropped the tissue and started trying to act cute and rub his head against me. I said ""bad boy"" several times while tapping his nose and he seemed to understand what he did was wrong.

Are there any ways to stop this aggression before it gets out of hand? Like I said, he ONLY does this with tissues. Anything else he has in his mouth you can take it out and he won't do anything, but he defends his tissues with his life."	dogs

I got them before I found out the dangers of rawhide. I gave one to my dog and he was fine with it but got through it *really* quickly, was very thirsty, then drank a lot of water and puked it (just the water) back (I don't think this was a problem with the rawhide, he's just a dumbass - kept track of him after just to check and he's pooped and peed as per his normal schedule over the next 2 days so I'm sure his stomach is fine). But that prompted me to look them up and I read some horror stories... so I think I'll just stick to his kongs as far as chew toys.

But now I have a bunch of rawhide knots and no clue what to do with them? He does enjoy chewing them, so it's unfortunate that they're dangerous. I feel like it would be a waste to throw them out. Is there any way to make them safer? I realize cutting them into smaller bits is probably counterproductive since it just makes them *easier* to swallow. "	dogs

1000	[Discussion] Data Pertaining to Rescues’ Application Process	"Lately I’ve been interested in reading threads about people’s experiences attempting to adopt from a rescue, regardless of whether or not they were ultimately successful. It’s clear that there’s a vast range of policies and processes, where some rescues have very rigid requirements and others are more flexible.

A) What I’m curious about is whether or not there’s much useful data regarding the practices of independent rescue organizations, and perhaps private shelters as well. For example, do any / many rescues publish their acceptance rate (percentage of applicants who get approved to adopt)? 

I know that can be complicated to calculate, especially if you have multiple people apply for the same dog, who are not interested in any other dog. Also would be somewhat confounded by the potential variance in quality between diff pools of applicants, whether that’s a regional thing or because applicants of a certain quality are more attracted to certain rescues for any number of reasons. 

B) Does anyone know of a directory of rescue organizations that collects / displays relevant bullet points regarding adoption policies (for example, “requires home ownership”)? 

Part of the reason I’m interested is because there’s obviously a reputation that rescues have in general, in that their policies are very strict and there are no exceptions. That reputation actually almost persuaded me to not even bother applying for my rescue dog, because I failed to meet those standards on so many fronts, including some that were specifically spelled out by the rescue in question. Obviously I’m glad I ended up giving it a shot anyway and feel very lucky to have been approved, seemingly against the odds. 

C) Does anyone know of any studies regarding the most effective approaches for placing dogs in forever homes? Obviously some adopters who meet the stereotypical rigid requirements end up returning dogs, and some adopters who don’t look good on paper at all end up being wonderful homes (I count myself as one of those). So is there any data re: what forever homes have in common? Or is the process of placing dogs always going to have a certain failure rate that can’t really be mitigated? 

And other related questions, anecdotes, thoughts, and perspectives. Discuss. 

ETA: am also interested in links to blogs of a/o sites featuring perspectives from people involved in rescues and shelter work."	dogs

He'll let it sit there for _hours_ but will still always be ready for dinner at five, no matter what time he ate breakfast (anytime between seven and four) he'll always remind us at 4:50 that it's almost his dinner time.

We've been to the vet, he's totally healthy, actually about four pounds overweight per the vet. He's a pretty happy dude, everyone is always commenting what happy guy he is. Seems like he just wants attention (which we happily give him). Has anyone else's dog done this?

The boxer would be fine with just a blanket on the floor because I do that when he wants to sleep in the room with us. 

So what do you guys think? Am I a bad pet parent for not keeping a comfy bed indoors?

1004	[Help] My dog's behaviour has been different ever since my Dad has been sick.	"My dog is an American Staffordshire bull terrier, he's a male and has not been neutered. Buster is 8 years old.

 He is extremely intelligent, he has found electrical wires that were burning our wooden porch and wouldn't stop barking until we came out to fix it. He's friendly and protective with his family, especially with me [F17] and Dad, [M56]. He is always so well behaved and he is very obedient. 

My dad has been sick for a few months now with really bad dizzy spells that he believes is vertigo. He has been going to the doctors and this Wednesday coming he is getting an MRI to look for cancer (the doctors are suspicious of his prostate activity). Now, these past few days Dad's dizziness has been really bad and this morning, Buster woke me up by jumping into my bed with his two front paws. He wasn't being sexual, he just wanted me to know he was there? I thought he was cold so I put a jumper on him. But after I came out he then kept jumping up into the couch with his two front paws which is where my Dad was napping. 

I know dog's can detect cancer and I'm wondering if this weird behaviour of his (he knows he isn't allowed on furniture) has anything to do with him saying that something isn't right. 

I'm thinking maybe he is actually smelling the cancerous cells... And that's why he's acting up but I'm not sure. 

Thanks for reading, I hope this post is allowed. Leave some opinions on what this jumping business could possibly mean. "	dogs
1005	[Help] Unique situation: Bringing a 4-month old puppy into a household with a year-old hyperactive Border Collie who never stops playing	"So we recently had the opportunity to rescue a young pup from a bad situation (kill shelter in the south) and took it. Here's the situation:

The new puppy (Juno) is a ~20 lb 4-month old spayed female Golden Retriever/Lab mix. She is super friendly and playful, no behavioral issues besides the normal puppy stuff, eg. house training, chewing, etc.

The 1-year old (Sulla) is a ~60 lb neutered male Border Collie/Lab mix, almost exactly 12 months old so not really a fully mature adult yet. He is a great dog, well-socialized, and has never shown *any* aggression to humans or dogs. He loves the new puppy and has not shown any aggression towards her either. We figured he would get along with a 2nd dog and were excited to get a new companion for him as a play partner to burn some of his energy out playing with. So far there have been no major issues.

The only problem we have experienced is that Sulla (1yr male BC) loves Juno (4mth female Golden) *so* much, and he is so playful and hyperactive, that *he* is actually the one overdoing it rather than the puppy being too hyper for him, which is what I assume is usually the case when introducing a puppy to a household with an adult dog. We are worried he could potentially hurt her or spark up some conflict by not respecting her wishes to settle down for a bit. We have been either separating them both (which usually leads to them pawing at and licking each other through the gate), or crating one (which usually leads to them pawing and licking each other through the gate), or crating both, which usually works fairly well and leads to both taking a breather and a nap. We have also separated them on different floors of the house as well which usually leads to Sulla (who is usually not vocal at all) whining, whether out of anxiety that there's a new dog in the house or because he wants to play I am not sure.

I'm looking for some guidance here on how to handle them. The issue is that the puppy will stop to get some water, or want to rest, and our 1-year old BC will keep playing until she seemingly starts angry growling. Our kennel has also told us they don't put our 1-year BC in the play group because he's too much and doesn't understand when other dogs don't want to play with him. 

We have been letting them play until it seems like the puppy is done, then separating them in two rooms with a gate, or on separate floors of the house. Should we keep them separated most of the time, and only bring them together for 15-30 minute play sessions before separating them again until they mature a bit and get used to each others company? Or will this exacerbate any potential issues?

Basically I'm looking for anyone who has experienced an odd situation like this (I assume most of the time it is the puppy who is hyperactive rather than the adult dog) to give us some advice and pointers. It is not a terrible situation and we are very fortunate to have two friendly dogs who enjoy playing, but I'm looking for some guidance on how best to raise the two and give both of them adequate space so they don't grow aggressive towards each other, and I'd like to keep the BC from getting too hyperactive and potentially hurting the puppy.

Also-- Are there any specific activities during play that we should watch out for and separate them upon seeing? For example, Sulla sometimes puts his mouth (lightly) around Juno's throat and will hold it there for a few seconds, and he occasionally will jump on top of her or hold her down with his paw. Juno is typically submissive and will lie on her back belly-up occasionally, but she is usually up and playing with Sulla tit-for-tat without much issue. Are there any worries in these actions?

Thank you all for reading this -- It got a bit longer than I expected. I appreciate any advice in advance!"	dogs

1010	[Help] My Once Happy Dog is Now Afraid of Going Outside and Acting Like She Has PTSD	"So here is the breakdown and any advice would be awesome: My wife and I just moved from a small apartment to a new home with a nice fenced-in back yard in a new neighborhood. We have been here for a month, and for the first 3 weeks our dog Yuki (Great Pyrenees) loved it. She took to our new home almost immediately and loved playing outside in our back yard, and we would go on walks with her in the mornings and at night. There is construction going on in our neighborhood where new houses are being built, but none of that noise had been bothering her until the situation that happened below. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Last week, we took her on a walk at night and nearing the end of the street - where the houses are partially built next to the woods - something in the dark spooked her (still no idea what it was that did it). She tried to immediately walk back towards our house. We took her back a ways and then tried walking her past that area again. Same thing, eagerly wanted to leave that area and go home. So we did. Back at the house she acted skittish and scared, but eventually calmed down. The next morning we decided not to take her out because she was still acting weird and didn't want to leave our upstairs bedroom. That night we decided to try again. I took her on the same route, but decided to jog through the ""scary"" area  to hopefully distract her. It worked and we made it around the neighborhood just fine (taking a successful doggie dump along the way) and she was acting like herself again in the house, eating and laying around. Success!... or so we thought.

\- The following day I let her outside and I could tell she was becoming agitated from some of the construction noise coming from multiple directions. A neighbor behind our fence was getting a mulch delivery, and the dump truck slammed shut after releasing it's load and clearly scared the dog while she was outside and she ran back indoors. A few hours later, I wanted to take her outside on the leash to see how she would do and if we could desensitize her to the noises by letting her see the sounds and workers that have usually never bothered her before. DANGER LURKED AROUND EVERY CORNER! Yuki kept snapping her head at every little noise as we walked down the street and got very scared when we rounded a corner and she saw an excavator and worker (doing nothing mind you) and she again tried to run home. She escaped from her harness and took off out of the neighborhood, down the busy main road, and out onto the train tracks very close to our house. After chasing her down the tracks, I stopped and walked away from her (Yuki likes to run away if chased or called after, but will come back towards you if you walk away and ignore her) until she circled back to me and I got her harness back on and got us safely back to the house, where she proceeded to pant and act agitated the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since this double-string of bad occasions, she has barely wanted to leave the bedroom, does not want to go outside to use the bathroom (to the point where she peed upstairs to avoid going out one morning) or go for walks, and if we do take her outside, she runs around around like things from the sky are going to attack her and squirms at every noise she hears. She is acting like she has PTSD and is just super paranoid about everything when she's not in the bedroom. She runs away to hide upstairs when we ask if she wants to go outside/go for a walk. She is refusing treats and encouragement to give positive association with going outside. She is barely eating and has to be forced outdoors to use the bathroom (which I don't want to do, but it's better than her pissing the house).

What advice do you have and have you had a similar situation where a once happy dog is now paranoid of the world? The construction is supposed to go on for the next year as our neighborhood is being built, and we don't know what to do. We have considered CBD oil or anxiety medication, but also want to help her naturally through behavioral training and positive encouragement, but it's getting worse and we feel like a quicker solution is needed before she regresses even further. Sorry for the lengthy read, I just felt like a full description of the circumstances would be helpful for any experts out there or people that have had something similar happen. "	dogs

1012	[help] is it possible to teach an old dog new tricks?	"I have a 8 year old American bulldog who loves to bark when he’s stressed. Which is basically anywhere he is out in public. He barks constantly when he’s at the vet. I took him to petco earlier and he got really stressed and started barking in the store. He’s pretty big so I feel like it scares people even though he’s not aggressive. He’ll even start barking in the car sometimes, when this happens I just ignore him and it stops after a while.

Anyway, I want him to be okay while out in public, or at least not making a scene. I was thinking mAybe if I just took him out in public more often he would eventually feel safer about the situation? I also work in a kennel and would love to be able to take him to work with me some days but he also does not do well in kennels. He is technically my boyfriends dog but we’ve been dating for about 2 years now and I feel as if he’s my own but my bf says he’s always been this way and won’t change. I don’t think that’s entirely accurate. 

Is it too late to train him to be okay in these situations? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!"	dogs
1013	[Help] update from Sunday	"Hi everyone,

The other night I posted about dog depression and my pup vomiting.

Well, we took him into the ER as was suggested and got some x-rays. He had nothing there they gave him some anti-nausea meds and sent us off. Nothing got better.

So yesterday we brought him to our regular vet and he did a blood test on him and found that he's borderline at risk for a tickborne disease Ehlrica canis(sp?) (We've been using a seresto collar so we're surprised by that) but more surprising is that his kidneys were working overtime and we came to the realization that he had probably been eating bits of onions that fell to the floor without our realizing it.

He's in the vet's office now getting fluids and hopefully will be better tonight"	dogs
1014	[Help] How can I get my dog to stop being so submissive?	"Last year my family adopted a dog, and pit mix named Sophie.

She was extremely malnourished, weighing about 25lbs. You could see all of her bones, she had kennel cough, worms, and didn’t seem to like men.

She’s now integrated into our family very well, and is submissive to our usually dominant Anatolian shepherd. The problem is, she’s extremely submissive if you do anything. If I call at the cat to stop scratching the carpet, she thinks she’s in trouble and she gets this submissive smile, and crawls over to me and tries to lick my face and snuggle. 

We don’t scold her, and if we do, it’s just pointing and saying “No”. I don’t know if she was abused or something, but it’s like she is so afraid that she’s in trouble. Is there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable, and less like she’s in trouble? It seems like even when I raise my voice she gets submissive, even if I’m not talking to her. But I can’t just never talk loudly, so I don’t know what to do."	dogs

1016	[Discussion] Feeding half raw and half kibble diet?	"I recently introduced my corgi to raw meals via Primal Raw brand patties. I introduced my pup to it slowly the first week via the instructions on the primal bag. 25% of the portion was from the raw Pattie and the other 75% was from kibble for the first 3-4 days. Then the next week I did 50% raw in the morning and 50% kibble at night. I've already seen a great improvement in his coat and energy.

After the week your suppose to transition to a full raw diet but I was thinking of maybe keeping the 50/50 split of half the portion in the morning be raw and the other half be kibble in the evening. I figured feeding him all raw everyday would be costly. And I don't trust myself making the raw diet from scratch because I have to take into account the proper nutrition.

I figured we overdid the treats (yummy, high value as well as his regular kibble) plus it was a tiring day. Today, I skipped treats completely but he's still not eating. He has had some food (a mix of can food and kibble that was in a kong) so I know he ""can"" eat. 

Idk if it's him realizing he's here and not home/ with his momma (like this will be a long term thing) or if he's thinking if he holds out long enough, he'll get the yummy stuff or if something else is going on. 

The kibble I have for him is the exact kind my sister has been giving him. Should I try a different kibble? The local pet store gives it sample packs, we can try that. How long should I wait before I really start freaking out? 

He's still his ""normal"" self- playful at times, listens to commands, walks and jogs with me. His unusual self is he's a bit more clingy than normal. Like right now, he's cuddled up next to me when before (before I took temp custody lol) he'd rather be by himself, not touching a human. I figure that's bc he's missing his momma and still a bit unsure about things. "	dogs
1019	[Help] Advice on getting a dog in a cat household	"I apologise in advance if this is a long post, i'll put a TL:DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----Back story--------

Me and my partner live together in a 3 bedroom house with a small to medium sized garden. We have 2 cats, 1 is a rescue and another kind of just attached himself into our family. We're now a happy 4 some. We have zero desires to have kids (we're a gay couple). We have both grown up with dogs, i have mainly been a dog owner my whole life, i never really liked cats until the 1 cat that just joined into our family randomly completely converted me and now i love all animals.

&amp;#x200B;

**-------Question starts here--------**

So in the next 2 to 3 years, we'll hopefully be moving to a bigger house with a bigger garden, this is when i want to get a dog companion and give him or her the best life they can get. My partner is in agreement that he also wants a dog when we get a bigger place.

Now, since we have 2 cats, we were wondering what would be the best way to get a dog and how to introduce them? We've baby sat my partners parents dogs for a weekend and we had to have them in the kitchen because they get over excited when the cats (inevitably) run away which turns into this whole thing of the cats being nervous constantly and the dog whining to want to go upstairs.

Would it be best to get a puppy from the start so we introduce this small puppy to the cats and since the cats would be bigger, they'd be less scared of it? Ideally, i'd love to get a rescue dog because there are plenty of them that need good homes but i've rarely seen rescue dogs that can go into cat homes. Does anybody have any experience in this field? Has anybody here had cats and had trouble introducing their dog? Does it just take a few weeks for both the dogs and the cats to realise that they're both fine with each other? Any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR.**

We have 2 cats, want a dog. Should we get a puppy so the cats aren't scared? Or has anybody had a good experience introducing a cat friendly rescue dog and it just takes a week or two for them to get on with each other?"	dogs

1021	[Help] Options to stop pregnancy	"Hi folks.

My girl (adopted, not yet spayed sadly) was in heat at the beginning of August. We didn't really realize (she kept herself clean and tidy and didn't really show much behavioral change)  until we found her mating with the neighbor's dog on Aug.10th. We went to the vet and he said that for her sake it's better to act against a pregnancy only after about 3 weeks, when the ultrasound shows if she's actually preggo or not.

He also mentioned there's multiple non-invasive techniques.
We went to the ultrasound at the due date but now he says that he can ONLY use invasive techniques on her? We'd prefer to use something noninvasive, let her get better a bit then spay her in a month or two after she's recovered for sure.

Some advice please? What time is it best to terminate a pregnancy (I read online it's 2nd trimester?) and what noninvasive techniques could be used?

1022	Feeding my dog just before I leave him alone for a bit, will it help with his attachment? [help]	"I want him to stop associating me leaving/getting ready to leave with bad things (he's a bit attached, it's nothing too severe yet but I don't want it to become a problem). 

Previously I would hand feed him and we worked on tricks with all of his meals and he has the basics down pretty well. So I'm wondering if changing things up would be helpful for him. For instance, keeping his favorite chew toys away and only giving them back to him right as I leave in the morning, putting out food for him immediately before I leave, etc. So the 'routine' of me leaving is associated with something pleasant and he knows me leaving == him getting fed. The only problem is I'm worried he won't associate them with each other so instead it becomes ""my human is really nice to me and then vanishes, what did I do wrong"" and just intensifies the attachment. Any thoughts? "	dogs

1025	[Help] Is it time for my old dog?	"My Pembroke Welsh Corgi (15/M/28lbs/USA) -- been in great health up until very recently. He has slowed down considerably within the past few months after a bad reaction to a vaccination (went into shock, almost died)... he almost certainly has Cushing's disease (poor coat, extreme thirst) and is now showing some signs of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (confusion and agitation/pacing, especially at night, nighttime urinary and bowel incontinence). 

It's gotten bad the past week -- every single night he'll have multiple accidents and compound them by adding some vomit after he ""cleans up"" his own accidents. We've tried putting him in a pen with some pads, his crate (he's crate trained) with pads/towels, and will now try diapers... he's basically getting bathed daily now at 4am when we are woken up by his accidents/smell.

His vet has him on PPA for the incontinence (not working), and recently began adding testosterone shots (not working yet). We're going to ask if Anipryl (selegiline) might help for the CCD/Cushings, but that could take months to kick in. At this rate, my wife and I are completely worn out and heartbroken for him... he doesn't have months to wait. Yes it sounds bleak, but during the day he's fine. Though he doesn't run around anymore (hasn't for years), his appetite is great, he's happy, and he'll happily trot/jog to get a treat or his food bowl.

Any ideas, or is it time for us to let him go? (feels awful to do so partially because we're inconvenienced, getting up multiple times at night to clean him up/deordorize the house)

Edit: I should note that with his age and recent health, we're reluctant to do anything drastic like surgery/chemo or other treatments for Cushing's. We're focusing on comfort/palliative care, and are willing to spend a good amount to keep him happy/comfortable.

1027	[help]disappointed with my dog	"So I feel bad even posting this but I need help/reassurance. This isn’t “puppy blues” - I’ve had Charlie since June and he’s around 9 months. 

I grew up with labs, and when I adopted him I was told he was a lab/golden mix. I realize adopting is never a sure thing and you don’t know what you’re going to get, but I’ve never been around a dog who won’t stay with their owner.

I had Charlie on a hike the other day and was trying to untangle his leash (a long lead) and in doing so he slipped out of his harness and sprinted off into the woods. 3.5 hours later my parents found him 5 miles away hanging out on someone’s porch.

I was obviously terrified and upset, and I’m so thankful nothing worse happened. However- the thing I most loved doing with previous dogs in my life was hiking and camping with them. The fact that I might have to do this with Charlie on leash his whole life makes it way more difficult/less enjoyable for both of us. He hates being constrained and I hate having to hold onto a leash when I’m scrambling up rock faces. 

This also rules out so many other exercise options- no fetch in fields, no swimming in rivers, etc. I’m basically just left with walks and dog park, since that’s fenced in. (I don’t have a yard) 

Am I just being super selfish? Is there any way to train him when he has a crazy high prey drive? Or do I just have to suck this up and deal with a dog who couldn’t give less of a crap about me as soon as we get outside? 

(Also just as a side note, I would only ever have dogs off leash in allowed areas- I’ve always been careful to follow leash laws) "	dogs

I put them to bed almost 3 hours later and went to check on them and there was a pile of vomit on the floor, but basically just looked like the food. There has since been 4 additional small vomits, each getting smaller and now there is bird seed in it. There are two dogs but I’m pretty  certain just one is vomiting.

1033	[discussion] sibling dog fights	So I have two dogs, a corgi (9 yrs) and basset hound (12 yrs) and they’ve always gotten along and had no problems with each other. Lately however the corgi has been attacking the basset hound and pretty aggressively that it cannot be attributed but to playful fighting. These attacks started back in February and the only difference in the house is that I left for school back in last September. I have always been the closest with her so could it be my absence that’s stresung her out and making her do this?	dogs

1035	[fluff] Brought our rescue doggo to help tend our farmers' market stall and she did AWESOME! So proud.	"Living rurally, we don't see many people or dogs, crowds, or busy places. I really wasn't sure how she'd do, so I expected to tie her to the car. The farmers' market is like the local dog park, where dogs come by on leashes or vendor's wandering dogs come visiting for snacks.

Stella ROCKED IT. We didn't need to be tied up at all. She stuck by my side, laid under the table, took treats nicely, and followed me around to shop. Most surprisingly, if she got up to go visit a dog uninvited, she had perfect recall. She took pets from all the visitors nicely and charmed everyone. THIS great attitude and trustworthiness were what I really wanted in a farm dog, and I definitely don't take all the credit for her abilities.

Just for fun, [here's a pic..](https://imgur.com/a/0jSA4Cv)

Stuffed with treats, panting, and exhausted from stimulus, she had a long nap that afternoon."	dogs
1036	[Help] Anxiety-based aggression in 3 year old male neutered cockapoo	"Hi everyone, I'm a first time poster here and was wondering if I could get some advice on my situation. Sorry it's so long!

I have a 3 year old male cockapoo that I adopted at 7 months old. Until he was a little over 2 years old, it was just he and I living together in my apartment. He has always startled easily/has ""nervous days"" and has some resource guarding behaviors (only with very ""valuable"" items, like found scraps on the street or dirty underwear, etc.), but with some positive reinforcement and teaching him things like ""trade"", we were able to make some progress and things never became very worrisome.

About a month after he turned 2, I adopted a 9 week old puppy. There was a bit of a transition period, but after a month or so they became best friends and have never had any issues with each other. I worked very hard to make sure both got individual time with me, since I worried my cockapoo would be jealous about not being the only dog anymore. A month or so after adopting the second dog, he started getting separation anxiety with me in the form of aggression. When I would leave for work in the morning, he would get very aggressive with me, growling and biting when I would get my bag to leave or when I would close my bedroom door. I used some positive reinforcement methods and he stopped doing this.

3 months later, I moved to a new state to move in with my boyfriend. My dog did great with the move. He loves our new place, loves where we walk, and loves my boyfriend. For the first 4-5 months of living there, he was very well behaved and seemed very happy.

In mid-July (about 5.5 months after moving), he started getting showing more separation anxiety aggression again. He started the aggression (growling and nipping) when I would leave for work again. He also started hiding under the table (his safe spot) and growling if we go near whenever both my boyfriend and I are about to leave the apartment.

This then progressed to more severe aggression that I believe is related to his anxiety, but also seems somewhat like resource guarding. At night when we get in bed, he started becoming very possessive of me. Once I lay down, he comes and lays on my chest and gets angry/growls if I don't pay him attention. It's like I'm the possession he's guarding.

This has now progressed in the past 2 weeks to him growling and biting me no matter what I do. If I pet him, he bites (pretty aggressively as well - I have a few bruises/punctures from these bites). If I don't pet him, he bites. Once he settles in for the night, he also growls if any of us try to move or shift in the bed.

Within the past 2 days, this has progressed to be VERY severe. Two nights ago, he attacked me when I tried to join my boyfriend and the 2 dogs on the couch. Later that same night, he came up to me wanting pets and started attacking me when I did pet him, in a way that's more aggressive than the usual attacks (grabbed tightly onto my hand and was shaking it - left several bruises, scrapes and punctures). These attacks usually start with him growling and snarling, me trying to de-escalate the situation and remove myself, and him attacking/biting before I can get away or calm him.

Last night, I tried to brush him (which he normally loves) and he attacked me without any warning growls. This morning, rather than just growling/being excitedly anxious/nipping when I left for work, he repeatedly bit/attacked my leg.

After these attacks, he takes a moment to calm down (I usually have to restrain him so he doesn't continue to bite), and then it's like he ""snaps"" out of it and seems totally normal and calm (and he often seems guilty/submissive afterward). It's weird, because it's like I'm the resource he's guarding, but I'm also the person who will take the resource away so he goes after me.

He has never done this to my other dog or to my boyfriend, only to me. I've been very adamant about giving both dogs individual time as well as group affection every day. We've tried positive reinforcement, distraction, ""time out"" alone time for him, more exercise, and supplements. 90% of the time he's very sweet, docile, and well behaved, but it's like he gets possessed and does a total Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde during these episodes. Edit: For short term fixes until we can make more progress, we've also stopped letting him sleep in the bed with us, which he has seemed okay with. He's now sleeping on a bed on the floor. We're also limiting his time with me so that he can't just run up and trap me in a position where I can be attacked. I'm still giving him attention, but in a more supervised and structured way.

I'm talking to the vet today to discuss anxiety medicine for him (something we discussed before but decided to try supplements first), but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this.

Thanks so much!

tldr: 3 year old male neutered cockapoo's anxiety-based aggression is becoming much more severe very rapidly. Will anxiety medication (in conjunction with behavior training) help?"	dogs

1038	[Help] Should I be trying to correct my dog for retaliating?	"Hi,

I've got a 9 month old Australian Shepherd. She's well trained, well socialized and gets plenty of exercise. 

We go to the dog park 5-6 times per week and she does great. She plays and runs and chases balls and visits people. Super friendly to all dogs and people, and if you had asked me at 6 months I'd have told you she didn't have an aggressive bone in her body. 

In the last few months, she's had a few incidents. She never initiates the fight, but when she's challenged she goes from 0 to ballistic in an instant. As soon as another dog makes an aggressive action she loses her mind and she does not back down. I don't think she's actually trying to hurt the other dog (she's not going for the throat, she snarls and snaps), but it's still unacceptable at the park.

It's happened once when another dog tried to hump her, once when a dog got protective over his ball, and 3 or 4 times when another dog is being possessive of their owner. She'll go up to another dog parent, they'll start petting her, their dog will snap at her and she'll go crazy. 

When I pull her off, she stops. When I let her go again, she doesn't go back after the other dog. 

I've been pulling her off and shouting NO. It happened twice today and we went home. I almost made this post a month ago, but she's had 3-4 good weeks and until today I thought she'd stopped. 

It occurred to me that I might be trying to battle hard wired instinct here, and trying to correct her for (in her mind) the proper response to aggression might be confusing. 

I don't want her to be afraid to defend herself, but I'd also like to go to the dog park without every little incident turning into an all out brawl. Is there a method for this kind of behavior? Is this normal dog behavior, or is it indicative of some other issue?

Thanks for your insight"	dogs
1039	[help] Dog and electronics	"We don't have a dog yet, but I'd like y'all's opinions on the following:

My husband works from home, so the dog will not be alone much (maybe 2-3 times a week for a few hours each). My husband will also take the dog out for a short walk around lunchtime so he can pee/poop.

We were going to just have the dog hang out in my husband's office in a little fabric crate or dog bed, but here's the issue: That room has SO MANY electronics and cables. We're talking music equipment like guitar pedals, musical instruments, these huge lamps you use for filming/photos, microphones, and the computer itself and everything that plugs into it. We obviously don't want our dog to harm itself and/or the equipment, so at first we thought, ""Okay, we'll only let Doggy in the room supervised."" But I don't know how realistic that is because my husband can be quite forgetful (so he might leave the door open) and he can be super-focused while working, and when he's editing music with his noise-cancelling headphones on, he doesn't hear ANYTHING.

So I was thinking to not let Doggy in the office at all, but put a baby gate in the office door so he/she won't feel so lonely? Or just close the door and leave the dog in the living room? Will the occasional work breaks to get coffee or to pee be enough to keep the dog from getting anxious? Thanks everyone!"	dogs

I am well aware that the breeds both need a lot of attention, especially in the exercise department. I was thinking that getting two dogs can keep them better entertained during working hours, and to not have an older dog feeling like a new puppy is invading their space later on.

Do these breeds go well together?

1042	[Help] Where should my dogs live?	"Hello Everyone,
I am in a pickle.

So the best way to start this off is to tell the story of how I got my two dogs and we will go from there.

About three years ago we decided to get a Shih Tzu puppy for my Girlfriends Mom at the time. She is a single mom and she had a Shih Tzu growing up so we thought it'd be a good idea. Me, my GF, and her Siblings pitched in and bought her a Male, Black, Shihtzu Bichon mix from the Pet Store. She loves him so much.  She named him Sol.

So even though we got him for her mom, my Girlfriend did the majority of the work. (Taking him on potty walks, groomer, vet visits, training, playing, etc). Her mom mainly just loved the companionship and the cuddles but would help out with the financial costs as well.

Fast forward a year, my GF was begging for another Shihtzu Bichon mix. She thought it'd be a good idea to have two dogs so they can keep eachother company and my GF wanted to love and care for another dog.

I was casually looking and found one on a local classified. Her name was Roxy. Roxy was a year old (same age as Sol), she is white and just a little smaller than Sol. But it sounded perfect! Same exact mixed breed, opposite gender, opposite color, same age. It sounded like it was meant to be. This was a good family but just didn't have the time to care for her so we took her in.  I paid for her.

We brought her to her moms house, and at first her mom or Sol didn't like Roxy. Sol tried to bite Roxy multiple times when we first got her and Roxy was so playful. (We didn't socialize Sol enough). 

Overtime her Mom now loves Roxy, and Sol and Roxy are literally best friends and inseparable. Happily ever after right? No.....

So this went on for about a year, Sol and Roxy lived with my Gf and her mom and her family. 

My GF and I got engaged, and got married a couple weeks ago and got a house. We are about 30 minutes away from her moms house. So the issue now is, we want the dogs and her mom wants the dogs but we Obviously want to do what is best for them.

I think they are better off living with my wife and I because we did most of the raising. Even though I didn't live there, I came over all the time and trained them. (Sit, stay, come, obedience, walk, roll over, place, etc). Me and her have been purchasing most of the necessities lately.  (Food, toys, treats, vet visits, etc). Her mom hasn't helped in a while with bills. Also, her mom hasn't ever done training, bathing, groomers, etc. She occasionally takes them on walks and just likes to cuddle with them. I just feel like we would take better care of them.

Now, on the other hand. Her moms reasoning why she should live with them is because someone will always be there to take care of them. My wife and I work during the morning so they would be alone during the morning from about 7:00 - 2:00 Monday - Thursday. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday we will be home with them.

Her Mom works during the morning too, but my wifes brothers and sisters will be there during the day. But even though they are there, they don't love to take care of them. They more just like the companionship but we have a hard time trusting them with everything else. 

Long story short, the dogs love everyone and to them, Ideally they would love everyone in the same house but that just cant happen.

Options are:

1) They live with my wife and I

2) They live with my mother and her family

3) We take turns, every week or two weeks.

No we cant split them one dog per house lol

What are your thoughts?

1043	[help] having two dogs in your 20s?	"I know you guys tend to not suggest dogs when you're younger but I feel like this is a unique situation. I have a dog right now with my long term boyfriend. The problem is my doctor and I have been looking into the possibility of a service dog.

Money is not really an issue with the two dogs. I'm just wondering if it would be overwhelming to have two dogs? My family also lives pretty far away so I was wondering if it would be mean to board my older dog when we visit my family.

I brought up the possibility of rehoming her but my boyfriend is really against that. So it's either two dogs or the old dog. 

Please be kind here, I know a lot of people are opinionated on this topic but I am in a fairly stable situation given my age and having a service dog would give me more independence/stability.

Edit: also please understand that I love my current dog a LOT, I only brought up rehoming her because if I had to choose between regaining my independence with a service dog, and keeping her, I'd choose the latter."	dogs
1044	[Help] doubting my decision,should i put my dog down before it gets worse?	"\*This is my first post on Reddit i don't know how everything works yet.

\*Also English is not my first language so i apologize for spelling/grammar mistakes in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I made an appointment to put my dog Noor ( 12 years old female Rhodesian Ridgeback ) to sleep on Friday. She has arthritis which seems to get worse. And since a month ago she can't hold her pee anymore. She pees everywhere. When she's asleep, when she walks her bladder control is gone. When she lays down and sometimes after half an hour gets up her legs will get all wet from laying in her own pee. So we use diapers now. Also we had to throw  out her arthritis bed because she wouldn't lay on it anymore because it smelled like urine.

Then last week it started getting worse she threw up everyday, didn't eat as much as she used too. The vet did a blood test and said she has Kidney failure quite advanced, there is nothing more they can do except putting her on special dog food ( if she wants to eat it) and giving her medicine to control her nauseousness. Also she lost a lot of weight 4 kl (8 pounds ) and she can barely walk anymore because she loses balance or falls over. Also getting up hurts sometimes she can't even get up and when we tried to help her up she bit my mom out of pain.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that her arthritis pain killers aren't working anymore so they have to be increased but the pain killers are bad for her kidney's. It feels like a vicious circle. We decided to put her too sleep.But i contemplate it every day, almost every minute. When she wags her tail, or has more appetite i immediately  think i made the wrong decision. Because the thing is she is happy but sometimes in pain. Also the vet won't give me a clear answer when to do it.

I wonder should you put a dog to sleep preventative or should you wait when the dog is on the edge of pain. I feel like i can't see it clearly anymore. My mom says it's better to put her to sleep. But she's been with us since i was 6 years old i almost don't know what life is like without her.

&amp;#x200B;

So could someone please give me advice? i would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

tl/dr dog has severe arhtritis, incontinence and kidney failure but is sometimes happy. cant make a decision if i should put her down or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: hi, thank you all for the quick reply. I only replied specifically to one person because I didn’t realized i already got multiple responses. ( i don’t understand how Reddit works quite yet) 

Like i said in the reply, it feels easier making the decision now. And deep inside i know it’s time, and that i should not wait until it’s to late. I don’t want to put her trough that. She deserves better. 
It feel less guilty putting her to sleep hearing your responses and knowing i’m doing the right thing. 

So thank you"	dogs
1045	[Vent] If you have a bad feeling about another dog, trust your gut. Even if you feel rude.	"I was walking my dog earlier when I saw someone coming up the road with a bully type dog. He looked friendly, almost overtly so, straining and whining and all wiggles and goofiness, but I got a weird feeling especially as she didn't look physically capable of controlling him and felt like I needed to cross the street. I stopped and started to cross, and the dog's owner called out ""It's okay! He's friendly!"" I called back ""Mine isn't,"" even though he is, just to be safe, and she started following us and calling ""Let them sniff! It's okay, your dog looks sweet!"" Of course my corgi was bouncing and happy-barking, making me look like a liar, so against my better judgment I stopped trying to cross because it was so awkward trying to get away from this lady. I didn't want her to think I was prejudiced either, I'm not, it was that specific dog I had a weird gut feeling over.

She walked up to us and all of a sudden completely lost control of her dog. He barreled at mine, grabbed him by the harness and starting shaking him. I'm yelling, my dog is crying, chaos everywhere. He would not let go of my dog no matter how much I punched and kicked him. Fortunately he had my dog by the handle of his harness, and when the harness popped off, my dog got free and ran (almost getting hit by a car). She was able to hold her dog back while I caught mine, we exchanged information, I took him straight to the vet and he's going to be fine. Just has some abrasions and bruising from the harness.

I feel like the biggest idiot. I had such a bad feeling about meeting the other dog and must have somehow gotten a subconscious cue from his body language. Please, if your gut is telling you another dog is bad news for yours, listen to it even if the dog SEEMS friendly. Because I almost lost my dog today. Your instincts very well might be right."	dogs
1046	[help] do I give it one more day or go to the vet now??	So my dog has been sick since Saturday night. Starting at 10pm he he diarrhea and then at 12 and 1 and then just kept waking up to poo about once an hour until 6am where he finally held it for 2 hrs until 8. He went once more at 9 but then seemed done. This is where I think I made my first mistake: I gave him his normal kibble for both breakfast and lunch. He was acting  normal and was hungry so I fed him as if everything was normal. He goes to poo at 3 and he has one normal piece followed by, you guessed it, diarrhea. And it started again where he would be going every 2-3 hours this time. Finally I googled to see what could be done and apparently that's to fast him and then give him chicken and rice (but not a lot of to start with as to not expand his intestin) when whatever it is works it's way through his system. He's still acting normal and doesn't go poo on Monday, Tuesday he finally had one (janky looking but) solid poo and at night pood kinda mushy but still solid  poo. And that brings us to this morning where his poo looks like yellow gelatin. Now I know that if I give my dog too much chicken sometimes his poo can be a bit mushyer than normal and he's never had rice before (my dog is 6 months) so should I start giving him kibble again, give him only chicken, give him chicken and rice, or freak out and take him to the vet ( I'll be calling my vet today regardless but they sometimes talk me into buying things I don't need that don't help my dog so I worry they'll talk me into going in and try to sell me things that do nothing to help again) besides his poo my pup is acting completely normal, still eating, drinking, barking at me to throw the ball ect. And I am 100% overly paranoid helacopter parent so everyone tells me I'm over reacting, and he has almost gotten better on his own twice so let it run it's course. Any thoughts on if I'm just overly worried cause it my pup or if I should be and take him to the vet?	dogs
1047	[Help] 2nd dog... good idea or no?	"I'm considering getting a second dog but wanted some opinions on whether it's a good idea.

Current pets: 2 cats, 1 dog. Cats are indoor only and good with the dog.

Current dogs personality/lifestyle: Small dog, crossbreed between a Chihuahua and a working breed. Very high energy. Is at daycare and/or with a trainer five days a week when I'm at work. We do Flyball and agility on the weekends and train most evenings. 
No dog aggression but is slightly reactive to people when on leash (he barks, has never bitten - always working on it but this may just be part of his personality). He has a very active life. He's just over 1 now.

Reasons for getting another dog: I'm basically after another dog for dog sports. So, I'm considering an athletic breed, with a low-medium preydrive, who's also people friendly. 

Concerns: I'm aware that the new dog will also need the same level of engagement. Yes I've got the time but it'll be a full on commitment. I've also never had another dog in our home environment - my current dog is around dogs all day at daycare, training, or sporting events but never in the home. Also... the cats will have to adapt.
Oh, and puppyhood... That's full on. Especially as my partner doesn't work from home (as he did when we had the first). I'm unsure about putting a young pup in daycare vs coming home from work to check on him.

1049	"[Discussion] Our failed attempts to ""fix"" our separation anxiety dog, and issues with the rescue covering up behavior problems"	"**tldr; adopted a dog we did not know had separation anxiety, tried to help him for 2 months, couldn't handle it, and now he's been ""fixed"" by the rescue in a week.**


Right now I’m feeling a cocktail of emotions—anger, disappointment, failure, guilt, sadness, and probably some other things. I hope you will be kind to me, as I truly think we did everything we could handle to help this dog. Of course we could have done more to keep this dog, but our anxiety was just too much. I think we will be fostering in the near future (with another organization) to help prevent another situation like ours. My post history details many of the things we tried. I'm not looking to be told I am right, but please try to be kind, I would really appreciate that, since I am already so upset about this whole situation.


We adopted a 6/7 month old pit mix from a reputable, and popular local foster-based rescue on May 31. He has a lovely personality—is especially friendly toward humans and beyond gentle with children. He is smart, eager to please, and a breeze to obedience train! During the meet and greet, we asked a ton of questions about how he would do as the only dog in the household, how much exercise he needed, and all of the questions we thought we were supposed to ask. We were told by the foster (who had a 13 year old Husky) that he barked for 20 minutes in his crate, and then calmed down and was “fine,” for up to 4 hours. That sounded appropriate for our situation—one of us works from home 75% of the time and the other is PhD student with a flexible schedule. We planned to use a dog walker on the days we would have to be gone longer, and daycare/boarding for when we had to leave town. He seemed like a great fit and we were excited when we were approved to take him home.


The first week went well. My boyfriend worked from home and stayed with the dog all day long, and at night, we spent time playing with and walking our new puppy. We watched YouTube videos to learn to crate train him—he was starting to get it, and would walk into the crate on command most of the time. My boyfriend left the house to get lunch a couple of times that week, watching the dog on video when he left. He was gone for 45 minutes one day. The dog barked for about 20 minutes, settled down for 5, then started barking again. He managed to bite open the latch on his crate when left upstairs (we were in the house), and he cleared a baby gate multiple times. We didn’t yet realize this was a problem.


June 6 we left for 3.5 hours to run an errand, leaving the dog at home. When we returned, there was a note on our door from our apartment neighbor telling us that the dog had been barking the entire time we were gone. We were horrified and embarrassed, so we consulted a friend who is a vet, purchased Malena DiMartini’s book, “Treating Separation Anxiety in Dogs, and hired a trainer who was recommended to us by our vet. We also contacted the rescue and asked for some advice.


The rescue director explained to us how to crate train (exactly what we had been doing), and told us to use a “high quality e-collar to prevent “barking in the crate.” She also sent me this video and posts from random blogs. We strongly disagreed with punishment methods for anxiety, based on the copious amounts of research we had done, and got quite upset with her. I still cannot believe someone who has worked with rescue dogs believes that bark collars are a fix for anxiety.


The trainer recommended a plan similar to Malena DiMartini’s desensitization protocol, not using the crate. If you’re not familiar with it, it involves slowly building up the time you leave your dog alone, never letting them go over their anxiety threshold. We also started him on a low dose of Prozac at the suggestion of two vets and the trainer. The reason for no crate was that many dogs with separation anxiety also have confinement  anxiety. Instead, we blocked off a 200 square foot section of our living room, which included water, toys, a window, the couch, treats, and his crate. In her book, Malena stresses that this process can take several months, and regressions are part of the process. The tricky part is you can never leave your dog alone. That means, you need to find someone to watch the dog when you go to work. That was fine with us—we would take him to daycare on the few days my boyfriend had to go into his office or when we needed to run errands. We did not even mind that it costs over $40 per day in Seattle, it meant we could have some freedom and flexibility in our schedule. We set up a temperament test at the daycare and of course he failed—jumped over the playpen fence and barked wildly at the other dogs. I cried the whole way home. We tried again 3 weeks later—he failed for the same reason. Determined to make it work, I started using Rover sitters in our neighborhood and posted on Facebook asking for paid help from friends. People were willing to help, but it took me a lot of time to set up care for him, and this solution was not nearly as flexible as daycare. We also had him going to a weekly group training and socialization class for older puppies. He learned quickly, but was NOT great at playtime. He got quickly stimulated, and could not handle playtime with more than one other dog. While he was not reactive, he would bark at the other dogs, and a few times he began to growl. The trainer called him “socially inept,” but did help us understand his body language and gave us tips for socialization. When he met dogs on the leash, he was usually pretty scared, but never aggressive. In the meantime, we bought a new car (we were carless in a big city with decent public transportation that allows dogs). This was not something that was done solely for the dog, but we thought it would be a partial solution to not being able to leave the house. One of us could sit inside or outside of the car with the dog when we went somewhere and we could finally take our boy on hikes. Well, that didn’t work. After having previously ridden in cars, he developed car sickness, and would vomit within 10 minutes of starting the trip. Great. The vet gave us a prescription for Cerenia ($10 a pill), and did that work? Nope. Another thing we had to work on, and the summer hikes and camping trips we had looked forward to were cancelled. Still, we thought we could manage it. 


When we started desensitization, our dog was at the point where he would get anxious before we even left. We started with touching the door knob, and then started absences. In about 3 weeks, he got to 7 minutes (in evening and 30 seconds in the morning) and we were hopeful! At that point, a contractor came to our house, and we had to contain the dog in a crate. He was extremely anxious, but the crate clamed him right down. We were shocked by this, and figured the crate might help during desensitization. Surprisingly, it did! He stayed alone for 30 minutes without anxiety! We bought the dog a bigger crate, and restarted crate training. I tested him multiple times without the crate, and he would pace around the house, whine, and scratch at the door within minutes. With the crate, he settled quickly. While the crate worked for desensitization training, he would not get into it willingly. He did go in sometimes, especially when he was hungry, but he was clearly afraid of the crate. It was the only way we could leave him, so we continued using it.


Desensitization training took a toll on us. Both of us humans are prone to anxiety (especially me), and it was very hard to give our lives up to the dog. We were noticing physical symptoms of stress (vomiting, hair loss, etc.) and we were arguing more than usual. Social events were cancelled, we spent MANY MANY hours on training every evening after work, and I worried about him constantly. I even worried about what would happened when we moved in a couple of years. Even if we “fixed” him now, once we changed his environment, he would regress. Separation anxiety is a life-long condition that requires management throughout the dog’s lifespan. Training, however, was working, and there was progress, albeit slow progress. He was always watched on camera when we left, so we knew exactly how he was doing when we left. We got him up to just about 2 hours with no anxiety. Of course, progress was inconsistent. Some days were better than others. I had to run home from dinner or the park down the street on several occasions because the dog started to panic. Panic manifested in panting and whines, no more barking.


Around the middle of August, our dog regressed a bit, and was starting to panic after 40 minutes. We dialed down training, and he was doing fine with 30 minute departures, and eventually he could handle 90 minutes once again. The straw that broke the camel’s back was what happened after we “borrowed” a friend’s dog when they went out of town for 4 nights. Our dog loved this 5 years old gentle giant, and although he still didn’t seem happy when we left, he did a lot better being left with the other dog, compared to being alone. We started to think that maybe this dog needed a companion. Unfortunately, another dog was something we could not handle for a multitude of reasons, which I do not feel I need to justify. We were upfront with the rescue that our household would be a single dog household. I was hopeful that the “borrowed” dog’s leaving would not have an impact on our dog, but it did. The day after the other dog left, our dog had a complete meltdown in the crate within 15 minutes. I absolutely had to leave the house for 90 minutes for a work meeting, so I left the dog. He started barking, clawing at the crate, and whining, but I was too far from home to turn around and save him. We tried for a few more days to leave him for any period of time, but it was clear that he had developed an aversion to the crate. He actually got the crate open when my boyfriend was in the other room and jumped on top of the crate to get over a playpen. I tried again without the crate, and he scratched up the door after less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. He had regressed nearly to the point at which he was when we started, and we would probably have to repeat the process without the crate.


Yes, we could have hung in there and done this over again. This was a regression—something that is normal in separation anxiety training. But you know what? My boyfriend and I couldn’t handle it. We were just done. We were 9 weeks into this, and couldn't go back to week 1.


On August 26, we returned the dog to the rescue director. We explained the situation and everything that we had tried.While she agreed to take the dog back, which I appreciate, but  was very cruel to us over email. She made fun of us for using methods that ""didn't work,"" and mocked us. (Please let me know if you'd like to see the emails, I can screenshot them.) She told us that they would be using the bark collar to make sure he was “calm” in his crate.


Today, September 4 (just over a week later), I checked the rescue’s website and our former dog is listed up for adoption with the description below. There is no mention of his separation anxiety. The description says he is crate trained, something we struggled with for weeks. The description says he plays appropriately with other dogs off-leash. It’s almost as if this description was written to spite us and tell us that everything we noticed about this dog and struggled with is not true. I’m thinking that maybe we are the problem, but honestly, I think the rescue is just lying to get this dog adopted quickly.


*Fezzy is an adorable 9-month-old male mixed breed. His shelter and vet paperwork say ""Lab Mix"" but his DNA test lists him as 37.5% staffy and an assortment of many other breeds including Chihuahua!! He's a true mutt, the BEST breed! This boy is very loving and affectionate, and would like to be adopted to a home with another doggy pal to keep him company. Fezzy is crate trained, house-trained (as long as he gets out to potty every 4 hours) and knows sit, down, come and is working on place. He walks like an absolute dream on a leash and is a great companion to dog-friendly places. He is not reactive to other dogs on leash and is a happy go lucky companion. He plays appropriately with other dogs off-leash.*


I saw this when I woke up and I felt ill. I can’t help but feel so sorry for the next family who will be adopting him without knowledge of his behavior issues. Maybe another dog will help him, but he still has a serious behavioral issue. Most importantly, I feel terrible for our former dog whose issues will not be taken seriously, and for this reason is at risk of being returned over and over."	dogs
1050	[Help] Traveling home for the holidays	"I am in the midst of looking for cheap plane tickets, to fly home for christmas. I'll be there for 10-14 days. I wanted to take my dog with me he will be about (6-7 months then, ~60-80lb). But after looking at the pet fees for air travel, taking with me on the plane is pretty much out of the question. 

I called a few different airlines and they are all $500 fees for a ONE WAY trip. So $1k round trip, completely ridiculous. My round trip plane ticket would be $300.

Dog boarding would cost about ~$400 for the time frame above, and I am not wild about that either as I really wanted him to come and meet the rest of the family. If I were to drive it would save a ton of money but take 18 hours to get there, and I have a lease so my miles which are already high, would go up even more. 

It crossed my mind to register him as a emotional support animal, but realize that is pretty scummy, and people like to rip apart people who do that. But given the insane costs to take a dog with you on the plane, I wouldn't really blame people.

Anyways, does anyone have any suggestions so that I can get my pup across the country for cheap, or am I pretty much out of luck?"	dogs
1051	[Help] Border Collie owners and experts of Reddit - advice needed before adopting	"Need some advice. My parents are 65 and looking to adopt a rescue dog. They are considering a border collie. It's worth noting that they have a medium size backyard and a fairly large house. My parents are relatively healthy and mobile.

There's no question as to the temperament and nature of the breed. My biggest concern is the amount of exercise a border collie would need. Given my parent's age, they want to be more active, however I am concerned that they won't be able to handle the needs of a Border Collie. The more I research online, the more I recognise how much activity the dog needs.

1052	[Help] Need some reassurance that adoption regret will pass!	"Hey,

I'm here for some advice please, this may be a long rambling post so I'm sorry in advance! I'll put a TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

After almost a year of discussing with my boyfriend about getting a retired racer and doing our research, we decided to go ahead with it. We were so sure that we were ready for the commitment, work and stuff that having a dog entails; and for the most part we still are. However, we're having some teething problems with him and I'm starting to get a bit of... well... 'buyer's remorse', if you will... And I hate myself for it. :(

&amp;#x200B;

Let me just clarify that I definitely DON'T want to return him! He's generally a lovely dog, but I suffer with chronic anxiety and I'm struggling to cope when things get bad. Allow me to explain...

&amp;#x200B;

Our new dog, as mentioned above, is an ex-racing Greyhound. He's a gentle giant and we went to see him at the kennels multiple times before we decided he was the one for us. Everything seemed so positive for the first few days, we both fell in love with him.

&amp;#x200B;

He was absolutely lovely, slept through the night with no issues at all, he was lovely and quiet, was house-trained super fast, learned not to beg for our food within 2-3 days... all was brilliant.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward until a couple of nights ago; he's started showing signs of territorial aggression and resource guarding. We couldn't get him to play at all the first few days we had him but when we finally did, he growled and snapped at my boyfriend for playing with him. It's common with greyhounds to get possessive because they've never had luxuries like their own toys for their entire lives, so when they DO have them, they're scared to lose them. So we shrugged it off and learned our lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

He was laying in his bed the night after and he growled and snapped at me for seemingly no reason. I was sat on the sofa just talking to my boyfriend when it happened. I think it was because his bed was right next to the sofa and he felt like I was too close to his 'safe space' (another common teething problem with ex-racers as they've always had a kennel to themselves so aren't used to people being in their space)

&amp;#x200B;

We've moved his bed into the kitchen now to keep the territorial aggression to a minimum (and so he stops guarding the sofa) and we've been in touch with the rescue that we got him from who are helping us break him out of this attitude he's developed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is though, I've had to deal with an aggressive dog before when I lived at home with my parents and it's incredibly scary and stressful... I'm struggling with the thought of having to go through that again.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I'm at work I'm terrified he's going to tear the house apart (even though he never has!) and I just hate the unpredictability and uncertainty that's lingering right now. I know there's an adjustment period for both the dog and us; and I know dogs are hard work. I really, really don't want to return him, I just need some kind words and reassurance that this adoption regret thing will pass. With my anxiety it's hard sometimes to see the positives, but I really do love this dog and I hope with all of my heart that he settles in well with some behaviour training in place. :(

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance, fellow dog lovers &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Adopted a retired greyhound, having a few teething problems with slight territorial aggression and as someone with chronic anxiety it's giving me ""buyer's remorse"" - I love him and deffo don't want to return him, but need help convincing myself that things get better"	dogs
1053	[BREEDS] What breed is my new rescue?	https://imgur.com/a/R4jgBLL Meet Maisy!!! I’m her fourth (and forever) home. She’s definitely got some King Charles Cavalier and Beagle but I feel like there must be another breed in the mix. She’s a barker (shelter said separation anxiety) which got her surrendered from her first 3 homes but I’ve found if I turn around and ignore her she stops. Still trying to figure out a way to silence her when I leave the house, but luckily I don’t live in an apartment so it’s not a huge problem. She’s an absolute lovebug and much more active than I anticipated but it’s so great to have a hiking buddy. 	dogs

1055	[discussion] I think my dog is just genetically predisposed to anxiety and I'm so tired of people thinking she's been abused	"My puppy is about 6.5 months old and is still scared of a lot of things. Random things. She is scared of some loud noises but not all. She actually isn't scared of thunderstorms if you can believe it. Lol. It also depends on the day. Sometimes she's a big scaredy and other days she is more bold. She is scared of things on wheels, especially rolling trash cans. Sometimes she's scared of carts at pet stores but not always. She mainly hates these things indoors. As in, she is less scared of noises/rolling things on a walk outside than if we are in a pet store between shelving. She is also sometimes scared of certain men (1/5 usually). I have no idea why. But will run up happily to all children and women. She has gone EVERYWHERE with me since I got her at 7 weeks. She goes out to eat with me and we go to pet stores. We do long walks in urban areas. She has had more ""socialization"" than any dog I've ever owned. I don't know why she's scared of so many things. I've tried every method to get her less scared. She has gotten better over time for sure but she still struggles. I'm so tired of explaining to people that she's just shy. That I don't hit her and she's very loved. She wasn't abused by someone previously. She lives a happy life outside of being scared of bags flying across the lawn. Is a genetic predisposition really that uncommon? Cause I've met a lot of dogs that were raised in the same environment and one was bold and one was shy."	dogs

1060	[Help] My dog suddenly won't poop outside	I recently moved from a house to an apartment. For the first few days, I primarily kept her kenneled except for feeding, play, and walks. I would let her out, take her down to eliminate, then play for a while and relax, then kennel her again before she needed to go. After that first few days, I didn't keep her kenneled and I didn't have any problems. That lasted for 2 weeks. Yesterday she didn't poop when she usually does, and instead, pooped in the bedroom about an hour later. Our typical night time routine is that I'll put my kids to bed, then come out and feed her, then take her down to do her business. Today I came out to feed her and discovered she'd pooped all over the living room. Not just a pile in a corner. In 5 separate piles in various places. I take her outside a minimum of 4 times a day so I'm not making her hold it extended periods of time. I don't want her to spend all her time in her kennel, but I don't want to destroy the carpet either! Help! 	dogs

1062	[FLUFF] She learned a thing	"Adora has been resistant to learning to pick things up on cue, whether it’s a toy or food. When I feed her little treats and she drops some I point at it with me toe and say ‘there it is’ or ‘it’s there’ and she eats it. Tonight we tried beef tails for the first time (and she *loves* them - even more than lamb necks) and there’s one big vertebrae she keeps trying to sneak into the lounge. She eats in the laundry and she knows he only food for he lounge is treats. I thought why not try again. Pointed at it and said ‘there it is’ and waited for her to pick it up then told her ‘go eat your dinner’ which means go to the laundry **and she took it in the laundry!**


Twice I did it standing by her and pointing at it with my toe and the last I had already sat in the lounge and just pointed in its general direction and said mothers it is, it’s there’ and she picked it up so I told her ‘go eat your dinner’ and she went to the laundry again! I’m reinforcing her stay and telling her to stay there when she’s in there but I’m so happy this one just clicked tonight ❤️"	dogs

1065	[Vent] just because my dog is cute doesn’t mean you’re entitled to touch him	I have a corgi and due to some very bad past experiences he does NOT like children. Ive been working with a trainer to fix this but until then he’s very skittish around them and I go out of my way to avoid them. I live in an apartment complex that’s mainly full of young people like me so luckily there’s not many children running around but when we go to the park (I have a route that avoids the playground there) there’s always at least one or two parents that try to insist that their kid meets my dog since he’s not exactly the most threatening lil guy. I always keep my distance and say “no he doesn’t like children don’t bring them over” but a week ago there was a woman who (my back was turned) walked up w her kid and when I felt my dog tugging away (not towards the kid- he is terrified of them but will bark and has twice snapped a little because he’s defending himself) I turned around and told her he doesn’t like kids and to leave us alone. She gave me the stink eye and walked away with him. A few moments later we were at the crosswalk and (obviously I’m facing the street) I hear my dog start growling and there’s the same kid w his mom and the kid grabs my dog’s leg prompting him to run into the street while barking. I end up cursing the lady out (I semi regret it but wtf if someone says their dog doesn’t like kids why are you letting your kid near my fucking dog???) she screams that I’m a bad person and that her kid just wanted to pet my dog. I seriously hate people that think that just because a dog looks a certain way that it doesn’t have boundaries/rules. We now only go on hiking trails but it’s like hey- if I say my dog doesn’t want to be near you back the fuck up. I’ve also had the same kind of problem with people just running up and not asking to pet him and then immediately touching him (he adores attention from adults most of the time unless hes swarmed by people- then he panics and tries to bolt and I mean come on just ask first) and it’s so frustrating. Should I just get a vest saying do not pet? I don’t want him missing out on the extra social interactions but I also don’t want him getting stressed out in public settings because of disrespectful people. 	dogs
1066	[Help] Why is my dog crying about this new toy?	"My partner and I are currently in the process of moving and recently came across a big box of forgotten dog toys. We gave them to our two year old terrier mix and she has become incredibly attached to this big rubber Minnie Mouse squeaky bow from Disney World. 

She hadn’t previously played with them much/at all before now. When she has it now, she whines inconsolably which isn’t something she has ever done before now. She isn’t treating the toy like a “baby” which is something I’ve had dogs do in the past. She just seems obsessed with it and won’t stop crying. 

She brought the rubber bow to bed, and was just laying in top of it whining, at which point I put it away/out her sight. Now she is just looking  and sniffing around the room and crying a bunch. Is this common? Any similar experiences or explanations? Is there a way to take care of this and not get rid of a toy she is clearly attached to? 

Edit: To give more context, she once did this with a spiky rubber ball, which we assumed was just actually uncomfortable for her to hold in her mouth and got rid of. This toy is smaller/smooth and I would assume causes no discomfort for her to hold or play with. "	dogs

1069	[Help] How do I have “outside dogs” inside the house while keeping the house clean?! Any tips?!	"My two dogs keep bringing so much dirt inside the house. We live on a ranch and for the most part, our dogs roam around free. They have dug several holes around the house and they actually like to go under the house and “hang out”. By that I mean, keep cool from the sun, look for small critters, hide bones...

In the morning, I drive my Polaris around while they stay near me for some doggie exercise. Leave the house around 8am to go do work at the ranch office while the dogs stay outside, come home around 11-1pm to make lunch for the cowboys, feed the dogs, do laundry..etc... and do some more doggie runs.  The dogs come inside during this time and I leave them outside while I finish up work back at the ranch office during the afternoons. 

I let the dogs back inside and by this time, they’ve tracked so much dirt inside! I love my doggies and love to keep them inside with me when I am home. 

My question is... does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to keep the dogs from playing in the dirt around my house? If I re-sod the perimeter of the house, will they just dig up the sod and create another dirt yard?! What are your thoughts on an electric fence? Are there any miracle rugs out there (lol)? Any and all suggestions are welcome!

1070	[HELP] I’m worried about my 9m/o Golden Retriever — is it normal to be this itchy?	"I’ve had other dogs who liked having their ears scratched—especially when they were older—but this giant golden retriever puppy is kinda driving me nuts. Outside of play or sleep, she ALWAYS wants her ears scratched or her belly rubbed. Sometimes for an hour or more. If you don’t scratch her ears, she will cry. Constantly.

She has a lot of loose skin that I’m assuming she’ll grow into, so maybe that’s bothering her? I’ve never had a “big dog” before (and TBH I didn’t realize Goldens were big—I originally expected 40-50 pounds based on prior experience w/ a Golden/Irish Setter mutt (who was also the malnourished runt of the litter) so maybe this is normal... but I dunno. She seems very frustrated with all the itching and, frankly, I can’t always afford to spend hours at a time rubbing her belly while she gnaws on my wrist.

(Dunno if this is relevant, but I have health problems and am well aware that certain medications can cause really powerful itchy sensations that don’t go away, but my Golden puppy isn’t on any pills, though she was neutered a couple weeks ago and there is still some noticeable swelling where the stitches are, which may account for the belly itching. She’s got big floppy ears that are, as far as I can tell, clean—does not appear to be too much wax, dirt, or any signs of infection.)"	dogs

My partner has three dogs, one of which is a staffy x bitch ('Shadow'). I have been bringing Penelope around there ever since she was about six months old. Shadow is lovely, but she gets a bit funny around new dogs who come to her house - fair enough. At the start, she would growl at Penelope when we would arrive, but Penelope would do nothing - she wouldn't submit, she would just ignore her.

After a few months of that, Penelope has become the aggressive one. When Penelope sees Shadow she gets really agitated and tries to pick fights. I think it's because she's still on the defence from when she was younger and Shadow would growl at her. When they start carrying on we are usually able to stop it before it gets really bad, but they have had two proper fights now that we have had to separate. One of those fights was when we met at a neutral area (a park neither of the dogs had been before) and as soon as Penelope saw Shadow she ran up to her and they had a fight. Luckily, neither of these fights has resulted in serious injury for either dog, but I'm really worried it will eventually.

As it stands, it's a big problem because we aren't able to leave them alone together which is making the prospect of moving in together (which we had hoped to do in a few months) seem impossible.

I would really appreciate some advice on this!

Thanks in advance!

1075	[Fluff] My energetic troublemaker made me proud today! She was offered a job last weekend as a model for a photo shoot.	"Ok, she's actually a great dog; troublemaker might not be the right word. But my rescue border collie/shepherd/cattle dog mix has the energy of 3 dogs... so I'm a bit shocked with how well she did.

Last weekend a photographer spotted us on our daily walk and asked if she would be interested in a job! A client of hers was looking for a ""model"" to wear their product. In addition to keeping the products, she got $50 in gift cards to a local pet store - and better yet, I received copies of the photos! I was amazed with how well she cooperated - I told her to sit and she seemed to just smile right at the camera - take a look at some of the pics!

1076	[HELP] Prescription dog food/mixing foods	"Hi all,

I have a 4.5 year old chocolate lab. Located central Canada.

Originally the breeder recommended and only gave us 2 year hip and eye guarantee with the dogs if we used this food:

https://www.tlcpetfood.com/dogfood/

Ever since he was just over 2 years old he started getting urine infections. After taking him to the vet, we were given prescription dog food (see link below)
 
https://www.hillspet.ca/en-ca/dog-food/pd-cd-multicare-canine-dry

This food works. He is healthy and he hasn't had a urine infection since.

At this point this food is just too expensive (~$130CDN/month). Is there any options to mixing the food with a less expensive brand or should I not try this? All the vet did was give me this food to fix the problem and charge me an arm and a leg. Is there any other good brands that wouldn't hurt the wallet that I could try?

Thanks

1077	[Help] lab puppy's behavior getting worse and worse	"my parents won't get me a dog trainer or anything to help with the issue that my lab puppy is out of control. 90% of the day she's fine but then at certain times she will get in this mode where she wants to kill me. she jumps on me and rips my hand flesh until i'm literally begging for mercy. i've been using the yelping technique to train her and nothing's happening. i guess she just thinks i'm a squeaky toy or something but she literally tries to kill me, and sometimes jumps up and latches onto me and won't let go, forcing me to fling her off of me and then she just keeps jumping and latching on every time i get her off. please help it's just getting worse and worse and i really don't know what to do, btw if u are wondering she is a 14 week old lab

1078	[HELP] Long Haul Air Travel with Dog	My partner and I are moving from Canada to othe Philippines in a month. We are taking our 21 month old Australian Shepherd with us. He's a very friendly dog, who is not very anxious, but obviously has never been in this sort of situation. He is however a bit scared of loud noises. We have the option of taking a direct flight (16.5 hours) or flying from Toronto to Vancouver (5 hours) stopping for a few days and then Vancouver to Manila (13 hours). Anyone who has had experience flying with a pup have any input? We're worried that the direct flight will be too long especially once you add check in (prior to flying) and customs/immigration (after flying).	dogs
1079	[Discussion] Shoulder height VS Head height	"Hello fellow dog lovers;

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Is there a standard metric for adding height to a dog above the shoulder?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A breed could be 28"" at the shoulder but head up could be above 33"", plenty high to put it's head on your dining room table. I want to know if there's any guage out there to determine it? My favorite dog in the world (RIP) Bently was a way oversized German Shorthaired Pointer who was 29"" at the shoulder and was above my hip with his head. I genuinely would love to have a dog his sized again but neck height and head type varies between a boxer and a dane for example. Hence my question. Curious about everyone's experience or maybe history as to why the shoulder is the benchmark."	dogs
1080	[QUESTION] [HELP] Our 85lb mutt is a huge scaredy-cat. Any advice on dealing with canine anxiety?	" 

Can anyone offer us advice on dealing with doggie anxiety? We have two-and-a-half year old shepherd/lab mix who is terrified of crowds and adolescents.

&amp;#x200B;

We raised Wiggie from a pup and always knew he had some anxiety (nervous in crowds and new situations, etc.) but never realized how bad it was until I went back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

We initially tried to put him in doggie daycare, but after a couple of days he was asked to leave because of separation anxiety. He would cry the entire time he was there and bang on the gate until I came to get him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a high school teacher and got permission from my principal to bring him to school with me, which I started doing about a year ago. Wiggie has a crate in my classroom and I usually leave the door open so he can come and go as he pleases. The first part of the year went well. The students loved him and he liked to wander out of his crate during class time and visit the students and be petted. We go out on the football field every day to play fetch and chase birds and usually go for a walk around the neighborhood.

&amp;#x200B;

The anxiety has gradually gotten worse. He now refuses to come out of the crate if anyone besides me is in the room. If anyone approaches the crate, he trembles and has growled a couple of times. When we get to school first thing in the morning, he makes a beeline for the classroom and his crate, tail tucked down. And a new thing: he's tried hiding under the bed in the mornings when it's time to leave for school and whines before we enter the building.

&amp;#x200B;

One note: twice last year a student hit him. Wiggie was sniffing around his bag and the student smacked him--didn't hurt him, but surprised him (and trust me, the kid got reamed out for that). I'm not sure if that's where his mistrust of students stems from.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to try getting him a Thundershirt and see if that makes him feel more secure and possibly CBD. Has anyone tried that with their pets for anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. I don't want to be torturing my dog every day."	dogs
1081	[HELP] 4 1/2 year old boxer developing signs of aggression [Help]	" 

Hello fellow dog lovers! I have a 4 1/2 year old boxer named Bender, he's a great dog who for most of his life has been a very gentle and passive soul. On rare occasions he would get into a fight of any kind it would normally be with a dog that initially showed strong aggression or with certain Huskies (not sure why, he just isn't a fan I guess).

Since moving back into the city I at first left him at home during the day with the occasional dog walker, he remained happy and well behaved, frequently going to the nearby dog beach 2x a week minimum with no incident. Around 3 months ago I started to bring him to a local doggie daycare that would watch him while I was at work, and they never reported any incidents to me.

3 weeks ago, I took him to the dog beach where he attacked 2 dogs almost back to back, one was a huskie so I wasn't shocked, but was very upset, the other a slightly larger dog that he tried to violently hump (he is neutered). When I asked the day care if there had been incidents with him, they told me he has gotten progressively more aggressive, getting into regular fights with other dogs sometimes Once a day. This is all news to me this week.

He definitely has seperation anxiety, but that's gotten a lot better over the past year, however I need to know what I can do to curb this behavior, ALL of these fights start with him getting nose to nose with another dog, standing still for about 5-10 seconds, then lunging at them. He never draws blood (thank god) but does try to hump. He may not be the most well trained, but he can walk off leash and responds to verbal cues from me based on my tone of voice. Any help would be appreciated.

TL/DR 4 1/2 year old boxer started showing signs of aggression after starting dog daycare 3 months ago and now can't be trusted at dog parks, picks fights normally after staring at the dog, nose to nose, for a good 5-10 seconds, then lunges, but never draws blood."	dogs
1082	[Help] Dog Keeps Hurting Same Leg/Hip	"My girlfriend and I adopted George in March, at about 3 months old.  He was surrendered by someone so we aren't sure exactly what he is, but we are pretty sure he's some combination of OES and poodle (I guess sheepadoodle is the common name?).  He's about 65 lbs right now and still growing but it seems most of the growing is behind him.  One thing that is starting to concern me is he has hurt his back right leg/hip three times now:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Jumping off of our bed, at around 5 months old, he landed funny and was whimpering and wouldn't put weight on the leg.  I had to carry him in and out to go to the bathroom that night.  By the next day he was walking with a limp, but we erred on the side of caution and took him to the vet.  They said not to sweat it and gave us Novox (carprofen).  We kept him from anything crazy the next few days and gave him the medicine and he ended up fine.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Running in our yard at around 7 months old, he jumped up onto our porch and hurt the same leg.  Again whimpering and wouldn't walk, but this time it only took a few hours for him to start feeling better and he was acting fine by the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Just last week (about 9 months old) while running at an off-leash dog park he slipped on some wet ground and wouldn't walk for a minute or so.  He kept playing after and only when we got home and the adrenaline had worn off did he really start acting like he was in pain.  This time it was about a day and a half of being unable (unwilling) to put any weight on it and carrying him outside to go to the bathroom and such.  He didn't really even want to squat to poop.  Vet told us over the phone to give Novox again and we kept him from doing anything very active for about a week (he was wanting to run again by day 3).  He seems totally fine now.

&amp;#x200B;

I should note that he can be dramatic, but I've heard dogs are generally bred to be stoic and if they act like they can't walk it's because they are really in pain.  My concern is that he will keep injuring himself and have joint problems or something down the road.  I guess this may seem overbearing, but I wanted to make sure this wasn't a sign of greater problems to come.  If I had hurt the same shoulder three times in a 4-5 month period I would be changing my behavior and considering going to a doctor, but not sure if that logic applies with a dog (hard to have a puppy not run around).  Any insight or similar experience is helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Dog keeps hurting his back right hip/leg (essentially a sprain) and I am curious as to whether that is a sign of problems to come or that we need to limit how he is playing"	dogs
1083	[Help] dog stumbled and couldn’t walk well after playing fetch	"Hi all,

My 2.5 yr old golden retriever and I just went to the park to play fetch- one of his favorite things to do. We didn’t stay long because it’s hot (86 degrees)- probably only 15 min at most of time spent throwing the ball and him running to retrieve. 

On the walk home he dropped the ball accidentally and fell over when he went to pick it up. He then kept walking kind of lopsided but wasn’t favoring a paw or anything. Once Home he took a long time to cool down but now seems to be acting normal. I did some googling but can’t really find an answer, so I was hoping someone here might be able to help. Could it be dehydration? Something more serious? Any thoughts appreciated. Thank you!"	dogs
1084	[Help] Has anyone had this issue with your dogs nose?	"Hey everyone,

I got ownership of a 7 year old girl a few months ago. When I got her, her nose was very discoloured and almost looked as if it was peeling off. 

Picture of her nose: http://imgur.com/RGJ9Kqk

After 3 vet visits the problem if anything is worse. We've tried antibiotics, a fungal cream and now a steroid cream which if anything has been making it worse. I've been noticing there's more mucous build up and she's struggling to breathe through her nose. Anyone have any idea what it may be? I'm thinking auto immune (lupus maybe?) which I brought up with the vet who dismissed that idea. Other than when we've been using the steroid cream she hasn't been in too much pain/discomfort.

1086	[Discussion] Am I insane for considering getting a puppy and training my own quasi-service dog when I've never owned a dog before?	"Edit: At this point I'm thinking more along the lines of a well-mannered family pet that occasionally does useful things. I will do a lot more research and consult with a vet before having a dog bear any weight. 

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

This will be my first dog. I am raising two humans who in their teens/tweens seem well-adjusted and don't chew on the shoes. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)

I would rather adopt because I'm not sure how to ethically participate in the dog economy. However, most rescues in my area are surrendered because of behaviour problems. In two months of searching I have yet to see a puppy up for adoption (I live in a small city surrounded by smaller cities).

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

Biddable, good with kids and cats, not prone to barking, medium to large size, not super high energy. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Labrador, golden retriever, standard poodle, German shepherd, crosses/mixes of these breeds. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

From most to least import: Learn the names of my family members and get them for me when I need help (bonus points for waking the children in the morning on command), wear a harness that carries two ten-pound oxygen tanks and walk beside me, wear a harness with a handle to steady me on the stairs, retrieve household items, alert me when I'm breathing hard/my oxygen is low, open doors. I'm not looking to take the dog with me to malls and restaurants, just at home and on in-the-car errands. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

I'm home all day, so I can do several hours of interaction as long as I can sit down for it. I can do about half an hour of daily training on my feet. I'm willing to enroll the dog in puppy obedience classes and possibly get some help from a trainer after that, but funds for the dog aren't unlimited. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

My husband and children would be responsible for walking the dog for 30-60 minutes a day. We do have a dog park nearby and could get there once or twice a week, weather permitting. We also have a decent sized back yard and I could certainly throw a ball. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Brushing every other day or so would be fine, as well as other small grooming tasks as needed. I would rather not have a dog that requires a haircut every few weeks. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Lots of shedding, a little barking, and a little slobber. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

A little. Most places we go have fences, even if they enclose several acres. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Somewhere in between. The dog certainly isn't going to sleep in my bed. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Cautious. A touch of guarding but willing to meet visitors. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I'm willing but not sure I have the know-how. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Stubbornness, maybe. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Rarely. Once every couple of months I have out of town medical appointments which would have the dog home alone for 6 or so hours. There would be shorter stretches of time alone (an hour or two) maybe once a week , more often if the dog doesn't come in the car to drive the kids around.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

The kids would love a dog to play with and roam the neighbourhood with. My husband also likes the idea of getting a dog and would participate in its care. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

We have two tabby cats, both raised with kids and fairly relaxed. We don't plan on getting any other new pets. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Yes, older children in the home. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
 
N/A

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I'm in Ontario, Canada. Pit bulls are banned. My city doesn't have any other breed-specific by-laws.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

July and August tend to be 30-35C with the humidex. The winters can be -30C at night with the wind chill for a couple of weeks. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

My mobility is good, but my stamina is low. It's possible my medical needs will increase in the next few years and I will be away from home more often. We do have family in the area who are probably willing to help. 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

So. Am I nuts for thinking about this? "	dogs
1087	[Help] Dog will not go in the yard	"Some backstory:

My oldest dog (Shepherd-Husky mix) is 5 years old and we have had her for about 3 years. She is a rescue dog that we adopted from the local shelter. We recently adopted another dog (Husky) that is 2 years old and we have had her for about 6-7 months. Our dogs get along well with each other and our oldest one has definitely shown she will be the dominate one of the two. They will play with each other and go on walks together with no problem.

My oldest dog has always loved walks and that is usually the only time she would do her business. We would put her on the front porch but she would still never go to the bathroom in the yard, only walks. Our newer dog is just the opposite. She loves walks but usually does not go to the bathroom as she will go in our yard right when she gets outside.

The problem:

Some times when I do not have time to walk both of the dogs, I usually tie them up in the front yard. I do not have a fenced in yard so they would go out one at a time to use the bathroom. Since my oldest dog would not go to the bathroom in the yard, I would have to walk her while my younger dog is tied up in the front yard. Recently when coming home from walks with my older dog, she will not step foot in the yard. She will walk up the driveway instead and even pull away if we try to walk through the yard. Even Before adopting our younger dog, our older one  would never use the bathroom in the front yard; however, she used to enjoy just being out there. That has changed as now she does not want to go in yard or sit on the porch period.

Has anyone gone through a situation like this or have an idea what would be causing her to suddenly switch to hating the yard? I thought it might have to do with our younger dog; however, this only started recently as our older dog enjoyed being in the yard for the first 4-5 months with the younger dog."	dogs
1088	[Help] How can I avoid my dog getting aggressive with other animals?	"I have a 100 pound mastiff, she usually is a very sweet dog. A while ago on her walk she ran up to a raccoon and killed it. I did my best to mediate but was a bit scared just in case the raccoon would attack me but it was already dead.

A couple weeks ago a cat ran up to my dog (( she was on a leash )) and I’m not sure if the cat attempted to scratch her or not but my dog attacked the cat and grabbed it by its neck. I kept tugging on her leash but she just brought the cat along with her, the cat was able to run away unharmed somehow but my dogs aggression is scaring me. How do I mediate when things like this happen? How do I get her to let go when she already has the animal in her mouth?

1089	[Breeds] Adopting my first doggo	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This would be my first time owning a dog. I have always had cats growing up, and would only interact with neighbors' dogs. Growing up, I would often dogsit and catsit for any neighbors who would go out of town.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I prefer rescuing a dog so that I may give a homeless dog a home.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would love a dog who gets along with other dogs/cats/people as I have many classmates who also own dogs. I enjoy being active outside, so a friend who would want to walk the beach and visit the local dog park would be awesome. I prefer medium or large dogs as well.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* From my experiences, I love Labs, Golden Retrievers, as well as Australian Shepards, dobermans, and rottweilers. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* It would be nice to have a dog that I could even bike with, if at all possible. I would like to spend time teaching a dog obedience, and maybe even some cool, more ""complex"" tricks as well!

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I could take the dog on 2 to 3 walks each day, and spend time training in the evenings. This could equate to 2 to 4 hours a day, with trips to the dog parks and beaches multiple times a week.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I would say approximately 2 hours or so. I have 2 dogs parks in my apartment complex, one large dog park within 5 minutes, and multiple beaches in the area.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I do not mind brushing or trimming nails included in basic grooming. I would prefer to not have to pay for professional grooming regularly. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I prefer medium to large sized dogs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The barking may have to be kept to a minimum due to my apartment living. I am not the biggest fan of slobber, but could tolerate small amounts. Shedding does not bother me.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I find this very important because I look forward to visiting dog parks and public areas with the pup. In addition, I am sure I will have many play-dates with other dogs in this fashion. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would prefer a more snuggly dog, but a mix of both wouldn't be so bad either.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I feel as though a dog who is eager-to-please may be easier to train, which would be helpful for a first time dog owner like myself.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* If someone knocked on the door, I would like if the dog would not go crazy barking, but maybe be slightly interested in the situation. As for strangers/visitors, I would prefer a calm and sociable dog.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, I would not.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I would want to avoid excessive chewing/marking, but I believe the chewing typically occurs when dogs are bored.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This depends on the day of the week as I have classes. The longest day of classes that I have would be from around 8 till 3. Otherwise, I am home practically everyday by 1, or at least can make a quick trip during the day at noon back to my apartment.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My boyfriend does not care one way or another about adopting a pet of any kind. He would like a dog that ""clicks"" with him when adopting. It is known that the dog would be my financial and time responsibility.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We do plan to have both a dog and a cat at some point down the road. I am interested in adopting the dog now since I believe they fit with my activity level, and we live in a very dog-friendly area.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not really, as I do not have much family in the area. The only children would be ones that would be encountered during walks.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We do currently rent, and the breed restrictions are about 10 breeds including pit bulls, german shepards, american staffordshire terriers, akitas, and other ""aggressive"" breeds. There are no weight restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live on the US East Coast, and I do not know of any breed bans.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* A typical summer day can be around 88 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, while winters are typically 59 to 61 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

His puppyhood with other dogs and humans was awful, hence the initial reactiveness, but before we got him he also had a brief stint in a foster home where he lived fine with other dogs too.

And after a lot of months considering the time has come to visit the shelters and see if we can't welcome someone else.

They are good shelters here, everything will be able to be taken at Jack's and any potential dog's paces. The staff will have tons of advice. I feel like I'm prepared for all outcomes but now a visit is imminent to see actual dogs I'd love to hear others experiences of getting a new rescue to join an already established one in the home. I've experience of a multi dog home but only dogs from breeders all pretty much growing up from puppies together.

I guess my main worries are just missing any small signs that Jack isn't happy with the situation once he realises what is going on, especially, and thinking way ahead to a point we may not even reach, if it got to the point of bringing a new dog home. Which again I know the shelter staff will be very helpful with when seeing if there's a good match for us. Whilst I'd love to give another dog a forever home right now, if Jack disapproves it's simply not meant to be which I'm perfectly okay with too as at least we'll have tried."	dogs

1093	[Help] Dog forgot housetraining	I have a 9 year old dachshund mix who, up until the last 2 months, was a perfectly housetrained dog since he was a puppy. Since then, , almost every time we leave him alone in the house, even for 30 minutes, he will go to a corner and pee or poop. It's gotten to the point where I have to crate him every time we leave and at night. He's not incontinent because he doesn't go in his crate and doesn't go when anyone is with him. Anyone experienced anything like this before?	dogs
1094	[Help] Risk of heartworm?	"My dog was free from heartworm two weeks ago when my vet checked him out. I got some heartworm / flee monthly pills, but at the time, they recommended to hold off on those until his kennel cough antibiotics brought him up to speed.

It's been two weeks now, my dog is doing a lot better and is cured from kennel cough symptoms. I gave him the first heartworm pill last night. Is there a significant risk that he may have contracted heartworm in those two weeks? Mostly an inside dog, but I take him out each day.

Should I go ahead and re check him for heartworm at a followup vet visit?"	dogs
1095	[HELP] My 1.5 yr old whippet mix has never shown aggression before but just attacked 3 dogs	"As the title states, I adopted a whippet mix from a shelter 3 months ago. In the entire time I’ve had her, she avoided any and all conflict, relying on her speed to get out of situations if need be. Today seemed like any other day, come home from work, pick her up, go to the dog park. The difference today is that we get there, and a German Shepherd and maybe 8-9 other dogs are already hanging out. I put my attention on giving her water, but then hear and see her barking, teethed bared, and biting in a way I’ve never seen it before. Thankfully no one was hurt. I wasn’t sure if it was her or the GSD, but I chalked it up as an isolated incident until she started fighting with another dog. I took her on a walk, on-leash, to cool her off, and she seemed to be listening to me once again, so I tried one last time. This time, she was rolling in the grass like her old self, but I guess got startled when a smaller dog came close to sniff her and proceeded to fight and bite this dog. I don’t know what’s gotten into her, but this incident is making me very anxious about how I want to proceed.

A couple things to note:

We very often come to this dog park, but were out of town visiting family this past weekend

She’s generally very shy and meeting a bunch of family members for the first time may have put her on edge 

It is very hot today, around 90 degrees with humidity

We moved to an isolated area of the park leashed for a little while longer before heading home. 

Have any of you experienced this sudden aggression? What’s the best way for me to act in this situation? Any advice would immensely help, thanks.

this morning my pup was sitting near me on the floor under my chair when i accidentally stepped on her snout, but i didnt put full weight on her, but enough to make her squeal. She didnt show any signs of pain after that and she hasnt yet, but do you think she's okay? does no signs = okay?

1097	[Help] My dog won’t go potty outside!	My recent rescue will not go potty outside. She was a stray and was abandoned when we found her. We unfortunately then lost her for a week one of the first few weeks we got her when she got spooked while on a walk and slipped out of her collar. She is clearly traumatized and is a huge flight risk and tries to run and hide whenever she is spooked (inside and outside). She’s leash reactive, but need to have one to go outside bc she want to run away and hide if something scares her. Everything scares her though. She is absolutely terrified of going outside, any noises, birds, cats, cars, etc. She won’t take treats when she is outside, so it’s hard to counter condition her. She doesn’t like to potty in the house (holds it sometimes for 48+ hours). We have tried fake grass, potty sheets, etc. It makes it nearly impossible to take her outside to potty though. She hunkers down into her safe zone and won’t budge. She is a medium size dog, so it is hard to comfortably hold her, but we have had to carry her outside to potty. She will go right away and then immediately want to go back inside. Any tips for this? It seems to be hurting our relationship at this point with her, having to pull her from her safe zone to potty. She won’t come to us, she won’t look at us and basically avoids us for the most part. She does explore the house when we are not home though. 	dogs

1099	[help] Our dog literally insists upon sleeping in our bed	"My dog is some kind of mystery poodle mix. She is a rescue mutt who was found with her brothers and sisters in some godawful part of Los Angeles. Because I have always rescued older dogs, she was our first puppy so part of it was misunderstanding some things early on that I regret now, and part of it is she seems especially challenging (which may merely be our perception). We are her forever home no matter what happens and we adore her. That out of the way, we could use some help. I've read some useless dog training books and have been watching a lot of YouTube videos that seem equally unhelpful ""Do you have a stubborn dog? Simply train them in exactly the same manner that didn't work for you before! You're welcome.""

I think part of the problem is, she was unintentionally coddled by the various fosters she was initially placed with when she was young. She was most assuredly not kept in a crate at night, but slept with either other humans or other dogs - possibly both. Another more general problem I've noticed is that dog training books and videos are woefully naive, giving people a false sense of what to expect. Everything they say that 'lasts two weeks' they ought to say 'could actually take several months or not work at all'.

Upon arrival with us, she would cry for hours at night when placed in her crate no matter how much exercise she received. This is what I had been led to expect, I thought, no issue. You just wait it out and ignore her, right? This went on for MONTHS. She cried at night no matter what we did. When she finally settled down after an hour, she would sleep for a few hours, need to pee in the middle of the night (which is normal) but then she'd need to go through the process of crying all over again. Yes, we tried putting the crate not in the bedroom at all. She howled louder and longer. After FIVE MONTHS of this we finally broke down and bought a baby bassinet co-sleeper (the kind for actual babies!) so she could sleep in a crate-like environment, but still be at the level of our bed. I even tried keeping one hand on her at night to reassure her that we are right here, right next to her. But every night, she would wait for us to fall asleep, then climb in with us. So every time she did it, we patiently put her back in her bassinet, told her ""stay"" and waited for her to fall back asleep through her crying. But throughout the night, she kept climbing into bed with us. Another several months of this? We stopped correcting her for our own sanity and our own interest in getting enough sleep ourselves. She's now a year old and has been sleeping in our bed for three months now. I'm curious whether there are any alternatives anyone may know about because allowing her to sleep with us wasn't our first choice by far, but it was driving us crazy and we felt like we were out of options. We also tried a trainer who wanted us to dominate the shit out of her, hold her down, bite her ear, etc. But that freaked me out. It felt like she wanted us to traumatize her for the purpose of making her experience Stockholm Syndrome. We would much rather address the root cause. If it were just me, I probably would have gotten her another rescue because part of the problem seems to be she is about a thousand times more extraverted than any other dog I've ever had. She cries when other dogs or human strangers ignore her or don't want to play with her. She has an insatiable desire for the company of other beings. But my partner doesn't think this is a good idea. Honestly, if it were just me, I would have probably just let her cry for YEARS if necessary and worn ear plugs to sleep. But my partner is very sensitive about his sleep and doesn't like ear plugs, so we often ended up relenting for his sake."	dogs
1100	[help] Going to adopt a dog - are we a good fit? timing?	"So this is a little bit in the future but I like to plan and be prepared. 

My husband and I want to adopt a dog but we currently live in an apartment where they aren't allowed. We will move to a different city January 15 (roughly) and of course we'll make sure our prospective landlord is okay with our plans of dog ownership. But it'll be in the city (250K inhabitants but very green, lots of parks, pedestrian/bike friendly). And we plan to have a two-bedroom (1 bedroom, one home office for my husband). So it won't be that big, might be on the 5th floor or something, and might not have a balcony.

The standard weekday schedule would be like this:

7 am: 15 min walk

12:30 pm: 15 min walk

5:30 pm: 60-90 min walk, dog park etc.

10 pm: 15 min walk

Is that enough? We'd do more on the weekends when feasible, but there might be days when we're busy and the afternoon walk will be cut short...

We plan to adopt an adult dog, 2 years and up, medium size (between 1 ft and 2 ft). I'm partial to spaniels and setters, but we'll just look for a dog we like and not care too much about breed.

I'll graduate from med school in November and will start my new job on March 1 next year. So from whenever we get the dog to February 28 I could basically hang out with it all day. (My husband works from home, so even when I work long hours, the dog won't have to be alone more than a few hours a few times a week.)

So my question is when the best timing for the adoption of a dog would be? And how far in advance would we have to apply (?) for a dog? Since they usually do a home visit here before approving you for a rescue dog, should we wait till we're settled into the new apartment to apply? (I'm slightly impatient in case you couldn't tell.) On the one hand, I don't wanna stress the dog out by the arrival of a new couch, for example, but I also want to have as much time as possible with the dog before I start my job.

Thoughts? Thanks :)"	dogs

1102	[Help] Dog is suddenly afraid of men??	I have an 18 month old female lab mix who’s been with me since she was 9 weeks old. We were very conscious about socializing her as a puppy and up until a few months ago have never had any problems - she’s always been friendly to everyone. We got to spend a lot of time together this summer and I’ve noticed when we go out that she’s not as friendly around strangers, particularly men and usually men in hats. She’s never tried to attack anyone but she barks at them when they walk by or come near us. Like I said, this just developed over the last few months. I can’t think of any negative experiences she might have had around men, and it’s not like we ever stopped socializing her. She’s fixed and she doesn’t have any health problems that I know of. I just think it’s strange that she was never scared or wary of anyone (literally everyone was her friend) up until recently. Should I be concerned? What can I do to fix this? I don’t want anyone to be scared of her or think she is aggressive. Thanks 	dogs

1108	[Discussion] Two-year old Golden Retriever refuses to eat from her food bowl.	"I am at a bit of an impasse and thought I would see if anyone else has experienced this or has advice. I have had my girl, Elle, since she was 9 weeks. I have never had an issue with her eating, though she is fairly dainty of an eater, opting to graze throughout the day over scarfing everything in a few minutes. I noticed she hasn’t been eating as much in the last week or so, but has shown high interest in treats and human food. She gets excited when I fill her bowl, but when I place it on the floor during our evening routine, she sniffs near it and backs away from it. I thought maybe it was the food, since we changed a few months ago, but she ate it fine at the start. It had been sitting out for a few days at this point, so I tossed it thinking perhaps it had spoiled in some way? I don’t know, I’m not a dog food expert. But when I went to refill, she reacted excitedly, circling around herself, and when I set it down again, she backed away nervously. So I thought I would offer her a couple of pieces by hand. She took them eagerly. I move the bowl towards her because she seems to be okay eating it, but she jumps back as if she’s afraid of the bowl. I took off her collar, thinking maybe the sound of her dog tags hitting the metal was scary for her, as she frightens easily with loud sounds. She still wouldn’t go near it. I should maybe add that she recently stayed with my parents and her dog tags fell off while there. They fastened them back on with a thick meta wire, and they hang much lower than they used to. So I dumped her food on the floor, and low and behold, she goes straight for it, and ate over half the food in one sitting.

My girl ranges on the pathetic side of the bravery scale. We only use her crate when needed, because she seems to really hate going in it, so we keep it folded up to save space. So when there are loud sounds (I.e. thunder, fireworks, construction), she will hide in the bathtub if we aren’t home. Have I coddled her too much? My fiancé blames her behavior on being “spoiled”, though I would argue she is simply very exceptionally loved. 

Has anybody else experienced this sort of behavior with their dogs? Any advice or thoughts on how to ease her back into eating from her regular bowl? Should I just crack the whip and leave her to eating the food in the bowl as her only option when she gets hungry enough? 

Also, lovely pics of Elle can be found if you go to my page.

1109	[Discussion] Sometimes you do everything “right” and it still goes wrong.	"I came to his subreddit asking to learn about breeders and pure breads and to be lead away from doodles several months ago. You guys convinced me. I did further research and took all the tips into account and at the start of the summer we brought home a beautiful Portuguese Water Dog who’s 110% fluff and 120% personality. We love her very much. [here she is checking to see if mom’s book is any fun to play with!](https://m.imgur.com/a/5gb7ZQo)

We found an AKC registered breeder with a litter in the correct timeframe. She checked all the boxes - only has 1-2 litters a year. Shows/titles her dogs. Did all the appropriate health testing for the breed. Had a waiting list (but someone on the list wanted to wait for a later litter and we lucked out on our pup). Very thorough application process for us, with multiple interviews - by phone as she’s seven hours away. Hundred+ pages of new owner education we had to go through before pickup and even more we went home with. Even needed to prove income to show we’d be able to support puppy, and of course there was a takeback clause in contract if for any reason we ever couldn’t.

We bought pet insurance and all the equipment we could possibly need. We take her everywhere Nd treat her better than some people I know treat their human children. We followed all the “rules” in the puppy books for socializing, vaccinating, puppy classes, etc.

Puppy still has some kind of congenital issue. She can’t swallow food or water well. No one has been able to tell why. She drinks from a rabbit water bottle and is hand fed small bites of soft food like eggs, mulTiple times a day. She coughs constantly. Immediately after eating or drinking she coughs up whatever she attempted to get down, along with gastric juice and saliva. She’s had two sinus infections requiring heavy antibiotics from fluids/food backing up into her sinus cavities at not even five months old and has been at the vet’s on antibiotics and iv fluids since Friday morning - it’s now Monday afternoon. She has pneumonia. We visited today and she’s doing much better, is acting more herself and we hope she’ll be well enough to come home in a few days. She’s ten pounds behind her siblings in bodyweight due to her challenges with eating, even though she started out in the middle of the litter.

This probably should have been a vent post, but I wanted it to stay open for other experiences or advice. We’ve seen four vets. We’re seeing two different specialists when she pull through this pneumonia to see if they can tell us anything. We did and are doing everything we know to have done, but the thing we’ve learned with our princess is that there are no guarantees. Our girl is a fighter, and we’re going to keep fighting for her too as long as we can. But all we’ve learned so far is that even if you do everything the right way, things can still go wrong. Everyone, just give your pups a hug for me."	dogs
1110	[Help] My mom won’t let me take my dog with me. read post for context.	"Context:

I’m getting married next month, and moving out to a new home, so the problem I have is with my mom (she’s the best person I know) and she does not want to part ways with my dog. 

She doesn’t want me to take my dog with me for really bs reasons, while I understand that she loves my dog, she needs to understand that so do I. And that wasn't our deal from the beginning (deal was that I take the dog to our home and then, take her when I move out), But I can’t just leave my dog for this reasons:

1) I have a brother who’s a good lad, but he drives a big truck and doesn’t really pay attention to his surroundings when coming home, he’s too reckless and I am affraid he will kill my fog (he already killed my cat accidentally and crippled other)

2) I know that, while my mom lhas the best intentions in her mind, she won’t take the proper care, she never did really with an animal before, a dog of her spent the last times of her life very sick due to poor care, (cancer) and partly because she works so much and doesn’t really have the time and proper knowledge to do so.

How can I talk her out and convince her to let me take my dog withouh creating too much drama?

1116	Dog maybe having separation anxiety? Advice and help needed! [Help]	"My dog is in a flat house for the first time in his life. We occasionally hear someone walking around and sometimes he growls and barks at the noises. Not always. I hope he gets used to them quickly. I usually use the quiet command and he stops. 

When I leave, he whines at the door. I've watched from Skype that he does it 0 minutes in the evenings and 5-20 in the daytime. At first he runs to his bed, sleeps, runs to the door and sleeps there and again and again. He sleeps maybe few minutes at the time. Then he stops and sleeps in front of the door, sometimes raises his head and might let out one bark but doesn't whine. When I come back, he is quiet. He might just sleep there for hours.

Does he have separation anxiety? Can I make this easier somehow for him? I thought about an 1-1.5 hour walk in the mornings and then leaving him with something to chew on like his morning food in a kong or a dry pig ear. I feel like he might not have separation anxiety, he is just getting used to a new situation? Should I ask for sedatives for him to calm him? He is 7 months old golden retriever and started guarding only a month ago, before we moved. He was fine being alone in our previous home, but would also sometimes whine when I left. It's more like a protest: ""hey, you forgot me!"" When he is scared or needs to pee he sounds totally different. He also lets me go to toilet alone and doesn't whine after me then.

Hello!!

​

I'm  getting a pupper soon, like withing a month or two, and I've been scouring the web on how to do this the right way.  The thing is there's a LOT of conflicting info from a lot of different places, especially around training.

​

I've had animals before, grew up with a cat and dog, I had a lizard as well, and I'm not new to caring for animals, but I want to go into this as up to date and prepared as possible.  I know that the whole ""alpha"" pack training thing is bunk but what would be the best resource on proper training methods and other dog care?  I don't know how much to trust the various dog-centric websites I've found.  A lot of them contradict each other or have info that feels pretty old-school, treating pets like property and less like companions, while others feel like the info was put together by people who seem to think  that anything beyond pampering your dog like royalty at all times is tantamount to abuse.

​

So!    Where do I look?  Who are some good actual \_authorities\_ on dog  behavior, training and health?  Who should I trust to give me quality,  up-to date information on raising and caring for a fuzzy companion?

My dog, albiet, is not that social, but is not vicious and has never bit another dog. His dog is very in the face with mine, as well as other dogs we have met at the park. He is still a puppy, so I understand the hyperactivity and playfulness. However, there have been times where I can see my dog stressed and getting annoyed, in which he will growl and show teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty much asking for some advice on what to do with this. We care deeply for each other and wish to make this next step in our relationship. We want them to get along, but we don't know how.

1121	[RIP] Sam, Golden Retriever, 12	"One year ago today my baby took his last breath. One day he was well, the next he wasn't and we made a decision I hoped never to have to make. He was beautiful, he had a whole lotta sass and he turned my now husband into a dog person. He was so smart, too smart for his own good. He picked up commandments so quickly, yet he knew how to turn his selective hearing on so he wouldn't have to do them (a treat always fixed that. He demanded pats from everyone who visited by sticking his nose under their arms to get their attention. Everyone loved him. He was such a character, he was my baby, and I will forever miss him.

1122	[HELP] Not sure if this is the best place to ask this. But it's about a puppy that will be imported from Romania to the UK. About the KC/Pedigree certificates and if I was to breed it.	"Hello! I have a good Romanian friend which I will be buying a puppy from his litter. He will transport it to the UK for me. Both parents are pedigree and he can show me pictures of their pedigree certificate. However he will not be pedigree registering this litter he is selling to me, I am unsure of why he is not but I know that he said if he was to pedigree register it the puppy will instead be double the price I'll be paying. I am fine with the dog not being pedigree or KC registered, I'm only keeping it as a family pet and will not be doing shows/competitions etc.

​

However I do have a question about breeding. Do breeders care about dog's being registered as KC/pedigree? (This is probably my most important question)

​

For example, if I was to find another same breed or even different breed owner, will they prefer not to breed with my dog since i was unable to make my puppy KC registered? (if it's the case that i am unable to)

​

And if I find an owner that does not care about pedigree/KC will the litter that are born be able to become KC registered or pedigree registered if it's the same breed? (I just realised I haven't mentioned the breed! It's a GSD :P)

​

Can I pedigree register a dog myself (I read/heard it was possible through blood test with DNA sample or something) Or if I only provide images of the documentations (this is probably highly unlikely since they'll want to see it, but maybe if i said I lost it or made up a story etc).

And since he is importing it under the table most likely it will not be KC registered either. Can i KC register the puppy myself, if he provides a picture of the parents pedigree. He will vaccinate the puppy and I will receive all documents of the health of the dog and it will be microchipped aswell.

​

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  

By under the table I mean, he drives to romania and drives back, it's a long trip but it's what he does, he will simply put the puppy in his car and drive with it back to the UK, where it wont be found basically. Atleast that's what he has said, he has also done it before according to him. I trust him and he is my friend, known him for a few years now. 

The breed is german shepherd.

The breeder has registered their dogs, both mother and dad of the puppy is pedigreed and SV registered, some German dog club, he has documentations of this.

​

The dog will also be fully vaccinated and microchipped before he comes into the country with it, and i will recieve a full health book and documentations etc. Meaning rabies, since I read UK is strict as heck on rabies!

1123	[Help] Dog acting strange after badly injuring himself and getting stitches	" On Sunday afternoon, we noticed that our dog (Alaskan Malamute x German Coolie) had some blood on his fur. Upon further inspection we found a rather large gash on his shoulder area that looked like it went pretty deep.

​

He didn't cry/whimper, didn't show any signs of pain and was acting the same as normal. When I went over to have a closer look, he rolled over for a belly rub like he always does. He seemed fine.

​

We quickly rushed him to an emergency vet who gave him a bunch of injections, anti-biotics and 14 stitches.

​

When we got him home again, he was pretty dopey but the next day and today he has been acting really weird. He's constantly sitting in random spots all over the house. Spots he's never sat in before, including spots he knows that he's not allowed in (and has never tried going there after learning that).

​

For example he knows he's not allowed upstairs but we've found him going upstairs multiple times, sitting in random places. Not just during the day too; we found him wandering around and sitting in random spots upstairs at like 3am last night.

​

It's not just random places he's sitting, but he also just isn't acting himself. I don't really know how to describe it other than saying he's just acting very weird and out of character.

​

Not sure if this is relevant, but we took his collar off to give the wound more breathing room and just to make him feel a bit more comfortable.

​

Do you guys know why he might be acting like this? Is there anything we can do for him?

​

Also, you might be wondering how he injured himself in the first place. So are we... We believe he did it in our backyard but we dog-proofed our backyard for our previous dog and I scoured our backyard on Sunday afternoon for about an hour looking for what could have done it and there was nothing that stuck out to me. I think it must have been a particularly sharp branch that he ran into while running around but I couldn't find one with blood or fur on it.

1124	[Help] Just gave up my dog and now feel lost...	"I moved into a high rise condo recently with my SO and my 6 year old American Staffordshire Terrier Effie. I have had her since she was 12 weeks old and she has never been a problem. Moving into this new building has set her off into a panic frenzy and she bark/cries for hours when I am at work. She has barked so much she has lost her voice for the time being and I have gotten noise complaints almost every day...

I have tried almost everything, I filled her kong with a treat and peanut butter, got her the thunder shirt, got that scent Pheromone diffuser, the ultrasonic anti bark box and nothing has worked to stop her from freaking out. I have had to start locking her back in her kennel when we leave because she has been shitting and pisssing when we are gone. 

I have even gone to the vet and gotten anti anxiety meds, Tradodone, for her and those only help for a few hours and she freaks out once she realizes we're gone. 

I have decided to move her in with my parents who live about 40 minutes way in the suburbs for the next month to see if she calms down at all and get her back used to the kennel because I now know I cannot leave her alone in my new place. 

What else can I do, I do not want to lose my dog and have to rehome her with my parents for the next 2 years...I cannot afford doggy daycare and going home at lunch is very hard. "	dogs
1125	[Help] Owning a puppy while working full-time	"I'm thinking with my schedule it will be best to get a more established older dog, however, I'm wondering IF it is possible and reasonable to potentially adopt a puppy. 

I work full time and just started my new schedule, 8:30-5. After a few weeks I am going back to my old schedule, 8-430. I live 30 minutes from my job, so in the mornings I leave an hour earlier than when my hours start, so I'm leaving at either 7 am or 7:30 due to bad rush hour traffic. In the evenings it takes me 30-45 minutes to get home. I have weekends off.

My roommate currently works part-time so is home more often during the week. However she is in the process of getting a full-time job and is most likely getting hired sometime in the next few weeks. She will have similar working hours to me, with weekends off, so it's not like we can take care of puppy during alternating days. 

My mom has agreed to take the puppy for a max of two days a week, which I really appreciate. She stays home and has two other dogs, so puppy will have lots of socialization and play time. However that leaves 3 days of the week where puppy will be alone for 9-10 hours. Of course when I get home (or if my roommate gets home earlier than I do) puppy will get as much playtime and interaction as possible before bedtime (which is usually around 10-10:30 pm). On the weekends I would be spending as much time as possible with the puppy. I don't usually have action-packed weekends, I like to spend time chilling in my apartment and hanging out with family or a few friends or something. 

The puppy in question is, I believe, about 2.5-3 months old. She is very new to the rescue and has been at the vets' for the past few days, so no one knows much about her yet. A foster had her for a little while before she went to the vet, so I'm not sure how far she has progressed in crate-training, if at all. She is getting out of the vets' tonight, so I will learn more about her tonight or sometime tomorrow. 

Provided I keep her in a safe room (I have a decently sized laundry room) for those 3 days, with her crate door open and puppy pads on the floor so she doesn't pee/poop in her crate and ruin the crate training, does this sound like a decent plan? Is three days out of the week with most of those 3 days being spent alone too much alone time for a puppy that young? 

If it's too much and won't work--don't worry, I don't have the puppy and have not gone through the adoption process. I'm just entertaining the idea for now. If it won't work then it won't work, and I'll keep an eye out for an adult dog. 

Thanks for any tips or advice. "	dogs
1126	[Help] When do you know it is time to put down your companion?	"Hi Everyone, 

to give you all a bit of context, my husband and I have an almost 11 years old pure breed Newfoundlander. We've had him since he was 9 weeks and he has been the most wonderful companion we could ever ask for...minus for the many health issues. For a quick summary: he has been dealing with serious skin problem since he was approximately 6 months and this has been an ongoing issue at least 6x a year. He also got a knee surgery at 2yo, then another surgery around 5 for a lump on his paw, he got diagnosed with a cancerous lump on his neck at 8 yo which they completely removed and he has been in remission since and for the past 6 months now, we've noticed that he has a lot of difficulty getting up and he has been dragging his legs more and more...we've also noticed that he's panting loudly by just getting up but yet, he has never complained. The vet saw him every month for the past year and at our last visit, she confirmed that even though his blood tests are fine, he is declining and last month she brought up how she is seeing his quality of life declining and we should start preparing ourselves. We know it's coming, but we don't know how far we should go. We always said: ""When Pablo won't be able to do what he loves: going for walks, for rides and going up the stairs, we'll know it's time!"" Well at this point, he can't go for walks anymore, but if we would ask him to go, he would gladly go and push himself to the max. Today I brought him for a ride and he got really excited but during the ride, I could see he was struggling standing up and he ended up just laying down between the 2 front seats. He's a newf so he has never been super active to begin with, but seeing him struggling with these simple things makes me terribly sad. I don't want him to become just a ""carpet"", but he still picks up his toys once in a while and will try to play tug with us. We've also tried pain medication for a month to see if we would notice a difference but nop, not really. 
People around us see the difference, and we do too, but it is really hard to make a final decision when he still shows some excitement for things he loves...even though he can't really enjoy them anymore. 

So here we are...seeing our perfect puppy slowly degrading and not knowing when it's time to let him go. I would like to know what would convince you it's time to let him go? 

Thank you for reading and giving me your opinion!"	dogs

1130	[RIP]Dolly, Boston Terrier 4 years old.	"My Boston Terrier passed away 4 days after receiving a shot at the Vets on Weds. We're all shocked and upset but still uncertain the cause of the death.The emergency vet said she appeared to have some sort of liver disease. It doesn't make sense because the day before she went to the vet she was bringing me bouncy rubber ball to throw so she could fetch. She was hyper and full of energy. 

I miss her and I have a lot of regrets about taking her to the vet or not taking her to the emergency clinic sooner. I didn't get to see her the day she passed. My Mother told me she was with her as she took her last breath. I wish I could say it was instant but she fought for her life for 4 days. It sucks. My sister found her new years day wandering a neighborhood with her sister. She was able to capture them both and she offered me one of them. Over the years I had a special bond with her. She loved me the most because I would take her on walks and play tug of war with her. She had a happy life but it was so short :(

We just adopted a two and a half year old, labrador/dachshund mix. We adopted her exactly a week ago today. She has been really sweet and great for our family. However, she is not eating very much. We are lucky if she eats one bowl a day (she has still yet to eat more than 4 bites from her bowl today).

It's the exact same bowl from her previous family, and she seems to drink water just fine. We reached out to her previous owners, and they said she was free eating two whole bowls a day. We also learned that she had issues eating at the home before them, as another dog was stopping her from eating. We don't have any other dogs that might be stopping her, and we try to give her space once we realize she's interested in her food. Previously, I've had some luck getting her to eat out of my hand, or sometimes I will sit down at her food bowl with her and she will finally eat. 

She is getting more daily activity than her previous home (part of the reason they adopted her out - she was getting two walks per week if she was lucky). She came back from her walks today and had water just fine. She seems totally fine personality wise. She gets excited throughout the day, walks are good and exciting for her, she seems to sleep just fine. Is this just an adjustment period or should I be more concerned?"	dogs

1138	[Breed] Searching for my ideal dog breed!	"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog that is entirely my own. I grew up with a Border Collie, and as a teenager my family got an Australian Shepherd that I was partially (maybe about 60-70%?) responsible for training and taking care of until I moved away.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Probably a breeder although I would be open to the right rescue dog... but don't want to run into behavioural/health issues. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Definitely a companion first, I want a dog that cares about me and wants to be near me most of the day. I would love to have a cuddly dog! However, I also run and hike frequently and would love a dog that could go on 5-10k runs and frequent long hikes as well. So a mix of active and lazy, I suppose. I want a dog that can do things with me, but will have a good off-switch when we are not being active and will be happy to just be pet. Preferably mid-sized. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I do love Border Collies and Aussies but I think their personalities are a bit too intense for me - and neither of the ones we had would ever sit still or let you pet them for any amount of time (that might have just been them though!) Other dogs I have thought of: Nova Scotia Duck Toller - not sure if they would have too much drive for me though, Finnish Lapphund, I love the personality of Italian Greyhounds but think I would want something that can be outside and in the cold more, Corgi, Shikoku, Samoyed if I wanted something bigger. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Definitely puppy obedience and basic training, but I'm also looking into agility, more intense obedience/tricks, and potentially dock diving if I had something like a Toller. Not too interested in competitions, but just training for fun. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours? I would ideally have a dog that would like to be near me (eg. on the couch) where I could also spend time idly petting it but not intensely paying attention to it. This would be extra time on top of actual training/playing. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Daily exercise would ideally be 30 min - 1 hour, with more on weekends. At least walks every day, with runs and hikes 2-3 times a week. I live very close to a dog park so would love to be able to take a dog there, and also live close to several large off-leash trails. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am very open to grooming myself or taking the dog to a groomers!

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Ideally somewhere around a border collie or slightly smaller, but not tiny. Let's say corgi - border collie range.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine, barking is okay if it's not constantly, not a fan of slobber though! 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is fairly important to me but potentially not a complete dealbreaker. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly as they come! Or at least likes being nearby. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Definitely eager to please. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't need a guard dog, so anywhere from indifference / cautiousness to friendliness is good with me! I would like if my dog likes visitors but it's not super important for me to have the golden retriever ""everyone is my best friend"" personality. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Preferably not. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression, like I said above, I would like to have a dog I could walk off-leash and not worry about it running away. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not very long, maybe a few (3-4) hours a day on average. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I wouldn't rule out a cat in the future but have no current plans of getting one. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Renting, no restrictions though. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Canada - my province has no bans. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is usually fairly mild with weather 20-25 Celsius (~65 - 80 fahrenheit)? Winter can get down to 0-10 Celsius (~30 - 50 fahrenheit). It rains a lot.  

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  "	dogs

I also have 3 cats that I would like the dog to get along with and I also know that alot of that had to do with training.

1140	[Help] My aunts dog attacked another dog, why?	"So, today my aunts dog attacked another dog (both dogs are okay, the smaller one was taken to the vet) that was a lot smaller than my aunts dog. I’m pretty sure she’s a Mastiff Lab breed but I’m not so sure on it. But anyways, she jumped out of the window and attacked a smaller dog for almost no reason at all. At my aunts place she gets along well with 2 cats, another dog and a bunny. She is 3 years old so is a bit young. But why would she attack another dog? ( to clarify it was sort of my fault because I had left her leash because I had no intent on actually walking her, just took her for a ride. ) The only way she was also able to let go of the dog was hitting her with a stick but she still kept going for the smaller one, even after getting kicked, eventually the police came in and tazed her. 

Both dogs are fine, sorry for repeating but, my aunts dog is still a little scared and from what I hear is the little one is okay. "	dogs

We’re used to having dogs, we’ve been at 3 at a time for like a decade. Our Doberman died so my mom was uncomfortable without a guard dog, but she watches my baby nephew everyday so we needed a gentle but scary sounding dog. The Great Dane fell into her lap from a lady going through a divorce. My mom had Great Danes as a child and in her 20s but it’s been a while. The dog is great, she latches onto me and my mom like no other ( she’s the true definition of a velcro dog). She still wants to play and gets excited when people come over which we understand since she’s a puppy, but my mom has some issues with walking her. She does this thing where she like stands up like a horse on her hind legs?Or at least that’s how my mom describes it lol. She does it anytime she sees a dog and while it’s not in a malicious way, you don’t want your dog to be doing that, especially one that’s 103 pounds. I’m away at college so I was wondering if anyone had some advice for me to give my mom.

1145	[Help] My dog has a sudden limp	After camping this weekend and coming home late Sunday, I noticed that my 11 month golden retriever had a slight limp on her back right leg this morning. I had just spent a very long time brushing her to try and help with the crazy shedding so I figured maybe her leg had fallen asleep or something so I didn’t really think anything of it. Later today I took her and my boyfriend’s dogs to the park and I noticed that she wasn’t nearly as energetic as normal and though the limp was very slight, she had some difficulty moving around. This evening, we had guests over and it took her forever to get up, so her leg is definitely causing her some pain. She slept most of the evening and didn’t really greet anyone, which is highly unusual for her. I felt her whole leg and foot and didn’t see anything. She didn’t seem to be in pain when I was feeling her leg, so I’m just not sure what could be going on. Her limp was much worse this evening and she won’t put her full weight on it. I was thinking that since we were camping this weekend and did a lot of hiking and swimming that she may just be sore (but it doesn’t really make sense for it to just be one leg) or have gotten stung or bit (but I didn’t see or feel anything when I checked), so I’m just not really sure what’s going on. My current plan is to wait a couple days and if she’s still limping I will bring her to the vet. Does this sound reasonable? Does anyone have any other ideas as to why she may be limping all of a sudden? She does get flea/tick and heartworm prevention and is vaccinated against Lyme disease. Thanks for any insight! 	dogs
1146	[Discussion] Saftey of “No Leash Allowed” dog parks.	"My dogs a 4 pound ratchi, this park does have a small dog and large dog section, and we really enjoy having her around other dogs and outside in a large fenced area like this. 

How ever recently I’m seeing lots of things like “I never let my dog meet other dogs or owners when on a walk” said in his subreddit, which makes me question the safety of these types of parks. 

What do you think? "	dogs
1147	[Help] My dog ate almost a whole bottle of cranberry tablets	I bought some NaturVet Bladder Support Plus Cranberry tablets today for my dog as she has a bladder infection and I wanted to give those to her before I take her to the vet for her bladder infection and while I was taking a shower she got to the bottle of cranberry tablets and damn near ate the whole bottle of cranberry tablets. Should I be concerned that she ate almost all of those tablets? She hasn't been acting unusual since she ate them as of yet but it was only a few minutes ago. She is a 50 pound 9 month old Pitbull Husky mix if that helps.	dogs
1148	[Breeds] We are getting a dog, I would love to hear people’s opinions on finding a suitable breed.	"I posted on r/Dogtraining asking for advice regarding training a 13 week vs a 8 week old puppy. One kind redditor suggested I fill this out to find a easier breed to start with. 

All thoughts on suitable breeds appreciated!

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Reputable breeder but open to rescue. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Happy, stable, likes being inside and outside of the house, smart, calm but likes to play, affectionate without sitting on me.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Rottweiler: I like how they look, that they are smart and trainable. All rotties I’ve met have been lovely, calm and friendly dogs. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Obedience, tricks, would like to do a dog sport (haven’t decided which yet as I was very convincingly talked down from Schutzhund)

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Hour in the morning and 1-2 hours in the afternoon. Inside/outside dog. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Same as above, the total time would be split between training &amp; exercise. Playing catch and going for walks would be the main physical exercise along with some sort of dog sport. Hiding food around, frozen treats, puzzles for food would be main mental exercise other than the training itself. Dog park if I found one where I would be confident my dog wouldn’t get injured. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Have 2 cats, they get brushed when they are moulting. Used to trimming nails and other grooming. The cats get a bath as required (they don’t like it but they live and I don’t get mauled). Would prefer a short coat with minimal regular brushing outside of moulting. Happy to pay for hair trimming as required as I have no hairdressing skills. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to Large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding: there is at least one bit of cat fur on everything we own. It can not be escaped. Rollers are our best friends. Barking: medium to low. The preference would be for the dog to be trained not to bark outside of play or warning. Slobber: on the low end of medium to low if that makes sense. We all drool sometimes but no ropes of drool from jowls to puddle on the floor. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not particularly. Yard will be fenced and my personal  preference is for the dog to be on a leash when outside for their safety. Would like to do a dog sport so I’m not sure what level is actually required. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Bit of both. I don’t want a large dog that only wants to sit/lie on top of me, I don’t weigh enough to survive it lol. I would like a dog that is happy to be chill next to me or head in lap or leaning on me. I don’t get upset if they want/need personal space, neither of the cats is a lap cat but will sit next to you and have pats when they feel like it. They follow us around when they want pats. Affectionate but not needy I guess is the best description. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Bit of both. No Maremma level of do your own thing  but also not a dog that wants to please anyone and anything.  I guess I would prefer a dog that trusts/obeys me and my partner but is not interested in others. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Not react to knocking or bark a couple of times. Entering yard, bark, lots of bark. Bark for days. Prefer a dog that has no real interest in strangers and is fine to have visitors but again no real interest in them. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Within reason. I would really like to do some sort of dog sport, presumably there are other dogs at clubs so preferably no aggression towards other dogs. It is important they they are not aggressive towards cats. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I don’t know all the possible behaviors so it’s difficult to tell. I don’t want a dog that jumps on people to say hi. No dogs with too much energy (I’m not a runner). 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Monday to Friday for about 9 hours. We have always had someone live in our house when we are on holidays to look after the cats so that would continue. Don’t like boarding. Am open paying for a an additional walker but prefer not. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Partner, also wants a large dog, regular involvement for the first 6-12 months then a job with lots of travel so I have to be able to manage the dog on my own. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* 2 cats (British shorthair &amp; Ragdoll) male, desexed, inside only. They are non negotiable as part of the family. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent. There are no restrictions as we will not be living in apartments. We already have to live in pet friendly houses as we have cats. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Will be in Brisbane Australia. Banned: American pit bull terrier; dogo Argentino; fila Brasiliero; Japanese tosa; Perro de Presa Canario; Pit bull terrior (sic); Presa canario. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 30/22 degrees Celsius and humid and winter 21/10. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Happy to answer questions. Not sure what else to include. 

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* I would love to hear people’s opinions on what would be a suitable breed. "	dogs

1150	[Help] poor golden has an abscess	"So my big happy 2 year oldgolden grew an abscess between his toes a few weeks ago and the vet believed it to be cheat grass. She tried to remove it but couldn't find any but none the less patched him up and put him on antibiotics. 

A few weeks have passed and now he has a new abscess on the bottom of his paw. I'm hoping to get him in tomorrow (they weren't open today for labor day). I'm worried that it could be the cheat grass traveling or maybe some sort of bad spider bite. Is there anything I can do for him tonight to ease his discomfort? I've been applying ice, lots of love and gave him one of the old pain pills I had from his initial appointment as well as a light numbing spray.

Thanks!!"	dogs
1151	[Help] My first puppy - Am I on the right track with training?	"I am raising my first puppy ever and I always feel like I'm worrying about doing the right thing. He is about 13-14 weeks now and to be honest he has been such a good boy.

We live in an apartment, so we are using pee pads right now. I know that not everyone agrees with it, but honestly it has prevented so many accidents. He goes on the pee pad I would say 55% of the time, 40% outside and I would say maybe 5% accidents. Accidents rarely happen, though, it has been a little over a week now since he's had one. I would like to take him outside more, to be honest, but we were told by our vet that parasites were really bad right now so we are mostly trying to keep him inside right now just to be safe. 

The biting was a little bit discouraging at first... I definitely got some pretty bad cuts from him, but I've been focusing on positive reinforcement, not getting frustrated, approaching him with toys and working on bite inhibition. He has improved a lot, though! And he is now starting to roll on his back for belly rubs with little to no biting. Now when he bites it's pretty gentle and if he starts to bite harder I just say gentle or ouch and he stops. 

When we first got him we received a lot of unsolicited advice about how to discipline him. I had done a LOT of research beforehand and I have never agreed with punishing a dog, especially a puppy. One coworker in particular stated I should do alpha rolling, which I completely disagree with. Instead I have been focusing on positive reinforcement and giving him lots and lots of treats. I mostly give him the dehydrated chicken and beef liver treats or a bit of his kibble. 

Training-wise he has been so eager to learn and please and I'm so proud whenever he gets down a new command. So far sit is super strong - basically anytime he wants anything now he will sit first. We also make sure to make him sit and stay before we give him his food. He also knows stay pretty well, down, come (still working on his recall), drop it, paw, and he now knows roll over! We're also working now on getting him to follow through commands in distracting environments and work on his recall. 

So far we haven't noticed any food/resource guarding. We put our hands in his food while he is eating, take away his toys and give it back (drop it/fetch) and he is not aggressive whatsoever. 

We have also been socializing him as much as possible. He has met so many people and is so friendly to them. He is surprisingly really good with kids as well! We have also introduced him to as many vaccinated dogs as possible and he is very good with them so far, too. He has not been aggressive at all.

Again, this is my first puppy and I feel like raising a dog is so stressful because you are the determining factor in how they act when they are older. I read a quote that one year of training is what determines if your dog is well behaved for a lifetime. I just wanted to go over what I have done so far and see if there is anything else I can be working on. I love this puppy so much and I would really do anything for him.

1153	Need [help] with problem dog and boyfriend	"I never thought I could or would ever hate a dog. I actually never imagined that I would hate any animal - I love them all from fur to scales. But here I am, scouring the internet for all the “Help: I hate my boyfriend’s dog” articles.

&amp;#x200B;

I’d like to start out with my history, as I know if someone doesn’t have dog “sense”, dogs just aren’t going to work out for them. I however, have years and years of dog sense. It’s not just owning dogs - I mean, I have \*worked\* with dogs. I did obedience and dog showmanship as a kid and agility with herding breeds throughout my life. I’ve owned hunting, toy, herding, rescues, mutts, etc. from my childhood up through my adulthood. Training has been my passion and my absolute favorite. I’ve worked in vet clinics, volunteered at shelters, and just three years ago started my own pet sitting business consisting of dog training. I understand dogs and I understand this one I’m having a problem with… so the problem? I can’t stand this dog. And quite frankly, I don’t even want to work with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Meet Charlie: A seven year old rescue border collie/australian shepherd. As you probably already know, Charlie is not my dog. To be entirely honest, if Charlie were my dog, I wouldn’t need to write this article. Because Charlie would have been properly trained. Charlie belongs to my boyfriend and my boyfriend rescued this dog when he was a year old. \*But\* those who know border collies and australian shepherds know that these can be difficult breeds if there is no mental and physical stimulation for the breed(s). And if you don’t provide that, I’m not sure you’re doing those breeds any favors. Charlie is highly reactive toward other dogs, people, and anything that has wheels. It’s not just barking - it’s like an ear splitting whine/bark that makes everyone stop what they’re doing and look at you. He also has separation anxiety which results in urinating/defecating in the house, chewing, tearing into the trash (though he’ll get in there even if you’re standing beside it), and barking/screaming at the door when you leave. Now, I’m not so much annoyed at these behaviors because it’s truly not his fault. His mind just doesn’t understand how to remain calm in these situations that basically cause him to stress. Really, my annoyance is directed toward my boyfriend who comforts/babies Charlie when he performs these bad behaviors. I mean, yes, it is annoying that a motorcycle can’t drive by without this dog running to my window and knocking over my plants to scream at something that will literally disappear in 5 seconds. So what annoys me? The things this dog can control. Like his bladder, for one. Okay? This dog is medium sized. He’s not a small dog with a bladder the size of a bean. He’s able to be put away at night (he’s put into a room at night because he gets on furniture, into the trash, and will try to hurt my free roam bunny) and let out when we decide to get out of bed in the morning. But nope! He’ll wake you up at 7am (we get out of bed at 9am latest) and screams until you let him out. If you don’t, he’ll pee or poop on the floor. Water and food is put up after he’s last taken out to potty before bed so I honestly don’t believe he can’t hold it. Why does he do it? Because he literally has to have all the attention. Every. Second. If not? Whining/screaming over and over again, even if you tell him no, right in your face. I wish you guys could hear this bark, honestly. I understand that dogs can’t talk and barking is the closest way to tell us that they need something but honestly? I refuse to revolve my existence around this dog. I’ll play fetch with my dog but after we come inside, I expect him to go lay down and chill by himself. Speaking of which, I have my own dog. He’s also seven years old and is a shepherd/husky mix. He’s also a rescue and I also got him when he was a year old. He was crazy, just like Charlie, but you want to know the difference? I trained him. I researched the breed (never owned a husky), I taught him basic manners, I taught him tricks, I went on hikes with him, but most importantly - I had the time for this dog. My boyfriend has worked 7am-5pm this entire dog’s life and it infuriates me because it is ridiculously unfair to the dog. And pretty selfish, if you ask me. Charlie follows my boyfriend around and demands my boyfriend’s attention 24/7. And my boyfriend just eats it up like halloween candy. They’re constantly tearing through the house, scratching up the floors while Charlie constantly barks, steals someone’s socks, takes my dog’s toys and tries shredding them, and when things are quiet - Charlie comes and demands it all over again. Honestly, I feel terrible for hating this dog, but his face is something just makes my blood boil. I have NEVER experienced this before. I’ve stayed weeks at a client’s house with up to four dogs at a time and never ever have met a dog that I absolutely can not stand. Just one thing I’d like to mention is that I also have a 3 month old holland lop rabbit - maybe you all are dog people but I’ll tell you a few things about rabbits. These guys are FRAGILE. And I’m not just saying that because I want to blame the dog more - I mean these fellows can have a heart attack just by dogs barking. If they get hit too hard in the neck/back area, it can completely fracture their spine. If chased by a predator, because they are obviously prey animals, they can flip on their backs and go into a immobile state. Also can result in a heart attack. My dog, Bowie, the shepherd/husky can be left alone with my rabbit and I 100% know that nothing would ever happen. We’ve had rabbits before, we’ve fostered kittens, and have taken in orphaned/injured wildlife when I volunteered for the wildlife center. He’s so gentle with her. But Charlie? Charlie screams when he sees her, tries chasing her (he’s always contained), and literally has no self control around her, or, with anything. I know it’s natural instinct because dogs are predators. And maybe that’s what you all will tell me. But guess what? Bowie has a bigger prey drive than Charlie. Rabbits, cats, deer, wildlife outside of our home? Fair game. But Bowie, again, is trained. His loyalty toward me is stronger than that prey-drive. We’re a team. I understand that Bowie isn’t a human and I don’t treat him like a baby - but he is a living thing and deserves respect. That’s what I give him and he rewards me with loyalty. My boyfriend just doesn’t understand that with Charlie - he doesn’t understand that dogs actually need and thrive with leadership.

​

The worst part? I am fully capable of training this dog. I am. I understand why he is reactive and I know why dogs get separation anxiety. I’ve desensitized plenty of reactive and fear aggressive dogs BUT they haven’t been personal. I didn’t live with these dogs. My animals were not at risk when it came to me training these dogs and honestly, I do it for work. Charlie is personal. My boyfriend and I are about to move into a home together and honestly, I can’t even be excited because of this dog. It makes me so sad. I’ve tried to love him - I really have. But between his bad manners and my boyfriend’s bad training, it’s become unbearable to even be around this dog. Now, Charlie has stayed with me for a week and we did some training. He was introduced to a gentle leader and taught “heel”, “look”, “touch”, and “leave it”, which he learned all very quickly. He’s an intelligent dog - truly. He just doesn’t get the physical and mental stimulation that’s required for his breed(s). He was taught “go lay down” when I wanted alone time or when I left the house. He stopped reacting toward the motorcycles, bikes, people, etc that passed by my window. He very rarely reacts anymore. So that’s an improvement and I recognize that. He stopped waking me up in the morning with his yapping and I made him wait until I was ready to get up and that was when he wasn’t barking/whining. I made sure to always reward the desired behavior and honestly, it went very well. He was the calmest I’ve ever seen him. Our walks were sometimes rough but he did very well in heel position. I live in a small town, two hours away from my boyfriend, and there are a lot of triggers here. I used commands like “look”, “touch” and “leave it” to focus his energy on other things when we came near a trigger. In the beginning, he had meltdowns but there were times we would see a bicycle in the distance and he wouldn’t even react. We had a cat meowing and following us for a block and this dog did AMAZING. I was so proud of him. I loved him for his progress. To be entirely honest, he listens to me way better than he does with my boyfriend. I don’t let him beg or have table scraps, I didn’t let him on my furniture, and honestly - I just didn’t baby him. I then gave my boyfriend “homework” after my week with Charlie was up and that’s where it all went crashing down. I would see Charlie right at my boyfriend’s feet, begging. We would video chat and Charlie would be on the bed. My boyfriend wasn't giving him the mental or physical stimulation that he needed. And then I just stopped wanting anything to do with Charlie. I know it’s not Charlie’s fault and it’s my boyfriend’s own but… he still affects my life, animals and space. I don’t want to have to lock my bunny in a room because Charlie will hurt her. I don’t want to leave the room when I’m trying to relax because Charlie is screaming at something. I don’t want to come home to a chewed couch or urine on the floor or that sort of stress after an already stressful day. And honestly, this would be more about my boyfriend and his actions, but everything is literally so great when Charlie isn’t around. I struggle trying to envision how Charlie even benefits my boyfriend because he’s just… obnoxious all the time. But at the same time, that’s not really my place, I suppose. I’m just not sure on what I should do. I’ve communicated with my boyfriend, obviously, because he was given homework - he knows that there is an immense amount of stress built up between me and Charlie. But again, he’s not my dog? So should I just not be bothered? Isn’t it not my place to be offering training tips, etc when he’s not my dog? Do I isolate myself? I mean, what do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m sorry this is so long. I just feel terrible about this whole situation… should I try and get my boyfriend to hire a trainer? He said he tried hiring one years ago but the guy basically said that he wasn’t able to work with Charlie. Which, I mean, I’m not sure about that. I have training experience but I’ve never went to school for it and I saw incredible results just from one week of working with Charlie. I’m pretty anxious about having to mention anything to my boyfriend, and I try to not let things bother me, but it just sort of bottles up inside of me and then I can’t stand to be around either. It sort of just turns into anger and then I’ll cry because I’m just not sure what to do about Charlie or my boyfriend. My boyfriend said that he would try and make things work when we move and if they didn’t, he would rehome Charlie. Which makes me feel even worse because I don’t want it to come down to that. I can’t stand the dog but I am sympathetic to him.I don’t know. Anybody have advice or can you share any similar experiences you may have?"	dogs

1155	[Help] Puppy buyer etiquette	So I’ve done all my research, picked a breed, and gotten in contact with some recommended breeders. I got lucky and seemed to hit it off with the first one I contacted who even has a litter on the ground (this was mentioned upfront). However, the catch seems to be that the litter is elsewhere with the mother dog’s co-owner. I don’t think I’ve been ruled out but I also haven’t paid a deposit or been put officially on any sort of waiting list. I’m kinda wondering how this process works now ... the puppies should be five weeks old so would I expect to find out if I’m getting a puppy the week they go home (10 weeks or so) or should I assume that I already am? How appropriate or often should I check in? Are you supposed to keep talking to other breeders until things are set in stone? Thanks for any advice!   	dogs

1157	[Discussion] Approaching a breeder/mentor	"I'm incredibly interested in getting involved in the Lagotto Romagnolo breed within the next few years. I've been told that the best way to get into a breed is to contact a breeder and, basically, find myself a mentor who will lead me into the world of my chosen breed.

I think this is a fantastic idea for me, especially considering that fact that I'm not an experienced dog owner (I got my first dog a year ago) and, with a rarer breed such as the Lagotto, it might not be the right choice for me even if I adore them as deeply as I do. Rather than potentially buying a pup or dog and realising I'd made a mistake, I would much rather dip my toes into the water, so to speak.

Not only do I want to get into the Lagotto breed, I also want to get into the showing scene too. I love watching dog shows and, no matter what breed my future dogs will be, I feel like I'll be involved in them no matter what. I'm eager to learn EVERYTHING.

I think I've found a potential Lagotto person who'll take me one or who'll direct me towards someone who would take me on and I've decided to send her an email at the end of the month. She's a small-time breeder who doesn't have litters too often but she's fairly known in the community for her three dogs which she shows and also has had some success in agility with, which is everything I want in my own Lagottos. From what I can tell, she also has some connections to some of the top Lagotto Kennels in my country who show in conformation more than she does. She's kind of perfect for me.

However, I'm a little stumped into what I should put into my email when I contact her. I feel like I have so many questions but I can't put them into words. How do I convey that I'm very serious about learning and finding someone who'll introduce me to the big wide dog world? Does anyone have any tips?"	dogs
1158	[Help] How to retrain the way my dogs ask for attention?	"My one dog, 4 y.o. mixed breed male, will paw at us to get our attention. He's basically scratching, but slower and with more pressure. If we ignore him, he presses harder and becomes more insistent.

My other, 5 y.o. mixed breed female, adopted this trait from the other. So she does everything I described above *plus* her own brand of intense licking. She is always licking, always. It's her first reaction to anything and everything and I can not stand it. My husband encouraged it, but he won't be home for a few months so I have some time to hopefully quell this behavior.

I have no idea how to stop it. I feel bad in ignoring or negatively reinforcing the behavior because they're just asking for affection. It's not that I want to deny them the attention, but I hate the way they ask for it. Not sure what to do here.

1160	[Help] What do to to stop two dogs from fighting?	"Hi.

I had three dogs (one chihuahua - girl, one bichon - boy and a mixed race one - boy) and they all got along together fine for years until the chihuahua died (giving birth) and then soon after these other two started fighting trying to kill each-other. I had to give the bichon away to a family that promised to love him and all but recently I went to visit him and he was in a really bad state, not taken care of, with fur never cut, all dirty and all and I immediately took him back. I washed him, cut his hair, and now he's all good and really happy to be back home but the other dog still remembered him and still tries to fight him (even tough it was about 2 and a half years they stayed apart).

She’s very active/hyper and doesn’t seem like like she has any pain preventing her from being her happy self however she does occasionally hold one of her back legs up for a step or two while she’s running, also if she’s coming down the stairs she holds the same leg up the entire time.
I haven’t tried to touch the leg or anything because I want her to be as comfortable as possible with me, I’m sure it’s hard enough for her being in a strange house and she seems to have taken a liking to me so I don’t want to scare or hurt her.
I’ve had dogs my whole life and I’ve never seen this before, this is my friends first dog and she’s very inexperienced, my thought is that while she may have noticed her doing this she probably thinks it’s just a quirk but I’m not so sure.
Could I be a trapped nerve maybe?
Has anyone seen anything like this before?"	dogs
1162	[Discussion] Anyone have a FitBark 2 with water experience?	"I owned several first edition Fitbarks. The first one was great, but it came off at the dog park one day and was never seen again. I ordered another one and it lasted less than 6 months before crapping out and dying. Fitbark replaced it under warranty, but the replacement lasted less than 3 months. They replaced it again, but that replacement lasted 2 months. They replaced it again, replacement quickly died... rinse and repeat several more times before I just gave up and tossed it in the trash.

They've come out with version 2 which is ""waterproof"" (I always believed that the original failures were due to water, my dog doesn't swim, but splashes on the shore at the beach frequently). Has anyone had water experience with the new version?"	dogs
1163	[Help] Does a possible vet misdiagnosis warrant reimbursement?	"Hi everyone,

My dog injured her nail while being boarded and was brought to my vet’s office, but was seen by a vet I’ve never met before. The vet claimed the nail wasn’t broken, only ground down (oddly, the only nail on that paw to have been “ground down”), and that’s why it was bleeding profusely. The nail was wrapped up and my dog was sent back to the boarding facility without pain meds or antibiotics.

Five days later, the boarder discovered that my dog’s injured nail was rotated. The vet was called again, said they didn’t have time to see her, and made an appointment for the following morning (17 hours later). So, the boarding facility took my dog to the emergency vet. The ER vet said her nail was likely broken from the initial incident, and had to remove the nail. My dog was then on crate rest for a week after, and her nail won’t grow back for a long time.

The vet (whose office my puppy has been going to since she was brought home), denied ever seeing my dog in the first place (later went back on this statement), denied the nail was broken when she was examined, and is refusing any reimbursement for the almost $400 ER vet bill. I don’t see how her nail couldn’t have been broken when she was initially seen, and my dog wouldn’t have had to go to the ER vet if her broken nail was initially treated. I feel reimbursement is appropriate. 

Has anyone here had an experience like this? I feel like there’s no possible way the broken nail was a separate incident from the “ground down” nail, especially since my dog’s paw was wrapped during that time and her activity was restricted. I know no one wants to admit to making a mistake, especially when it would cost their business money, but I have spent a great deal of money at this vet over the past year, and they’re adamant about not reimbursing anything from the emergency vet. To say I’m disappointed is a huge understatement. Does anyone have any advice?

1164	[Help] Becoming agressive, not herself anymore	A week before memorial day she was in the back yard, nothing unusual, then she started to yelp louder than anything I've ever heard. I ran out and it looked like her leg was broken based on how she was sitting on the ground. I ran to her and went to comfort and she bit my hand, plenty of blood. I backed off to grab some towel for the blood and she drug herself to the house and laid in my roomates arms as i got dressed to take her to the hospital. She wasnt in pain anymore and stayed at the hospital till she could use the bathroom. It wasnt a broken leg and without an mri i may never know. So months later to now she hasnt been the same, shes become more aggressive and distant, to the point she is a liability. I love her more than anything and she was always a very well behaved dog, can anyone suggest any options other than the only one thats the absolute last resort. Its breaking my heart and i have to try something, anything.	dogs
1165	[Help] Ophthalmologist for dogs in Southern California	"Hello,

We live in Orange County, CA, and are looking for an ophthalmologist for our corgi. He has tearing problem since birth, and it seems to get worse over time. My vet said because his eyelashes grow inward, they are irritating his eyes and therefore cause the tearing. She suggested us to consult an ophthalmologist and wrote us a referral to Eye Care for Animals.

We will be giving them a call this week to schedule a consultation. However, we do want to look around to see if there is other option beside this place. Is there any ophthalmologist you could recommend? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1168	[HELP] behavior issue with my dog	"I’m brand new, joined so I could ask for help. If you know a better sub, please let me know. 

I have a rescue Pyrenees mix, and she’s always been a difficult dog. Typical pyr behavior, stubborn, has her own agenda, etc. it’s always felt like for every step forward in training, we take a step back. 

She had parvovirus as a puppy, and we adopted her shortly after she was given a clean bill of health. She hated being touched and petted, and it took us a good year and a half of teaching her that touch is good before we could pet her without her trying to bite or paw at us. Now she lets me rub her belly, so obviously she’s very trainable! She’s currently 4 years old, and I couldn’t imagine life without her...

So let me tell you what happened today. 

Walking my dog has always been a chore, and I’ve had to work hard to get her used to being in a park setting. I have an electronic collar (the kind that plays a tone if the dog does something bad), and sometimes she has to have it or she just won’t act right. I’m talking jumping up on people, pulling, growling at nothing and everything, chasing bicycles, skateboarders, what have you (I know she sounds like a terrible dog). 

Lately, the neighbors have been gathering at the community pool and cooking out all day on weekends. My dog loves this and only wants to walk around the community pool now, because the neighbors love her and pet her and love on her and spoil her, but I think it’s starting to be detrimental to her behavior because the last few times I’ve tried to take her to the park (big dogs need long walks, and the neighborhood is not big enough for her daily exercise), she’s been stubborn and tried to turn towards the pool. 

Today was no exception. She didn’t want to get in the car, was doing her typical Pyrenees stand on the sidewalk, not budging, turning towards the pool, all of that. I finally got her in the car and took her to the park. I went with my mom, and when we were halfway through the park, my mom decided we needed to head back because it was too hot (American southern state, it was 90f and HUMID). I reasoned that it would be the same distance if we kept on and did the whole route, but my mom seems to have a little Pyrenees in her too and pointed out that we would be more in the shade if we turned. Not really, but I had already argued with the dog, i was hot and tired, and fine, we’ll go back the way we came. 

My dog did not like this. She wanted to continue. I did too. Mom was adamant, so I got behind my dog and started playfully “herding” her along. 

As we’re doing this, a couple was coming towards us. 

Keep in mind, my dog has gotten used to everyone in the world loving her, so she sees these people, and even though she doesn’t know them, she expects some sort of love and acknowledgment from them. She jumps on the guy and he loses it. I’m apologizing, my mom is apologizing, but he kept saying, “wow, that’s just great. Wow, that’s real nice!” His wife was saying something similar, “oh that’s just nice, isn’t it? God, that’s SOOO nice!” 

My mom is a nice person, I’m not. She was like, “I really am sorry.” I couldn’t believe they were being so rude. I stupidly said something like, “I guess dogs know who good people are, huh?” Because I’m an idiot. The guy goes nuclear at this point, dropping F-bombs, accusing my dog of attacking him, trying to bite him, he chased after us and got my license plate I think (he had his phone) and said he was calling the cops. I told him to go ahead. 

So I went to the police station right away (it abuts the park) and made a statement. The officer told me he doubted the people would do anything about it, but I’m still worried they’ll try to sue me or something. So my mom and I are at the station, which is part of the park, and they saw my mom go out of the station because you pass it if you’re on the walking trail in the park (I’m sorry if this is confusing), and these jokers start taunting my 72-year-old mother saying, “you’re getting arrested! They’re gonna Arrest you!” I was talking with the officer inside and she came back in and told him what they said, she was almost crying. The officer thankfully rolled his eyes and said that some people have big mouths. He still doubted they’d do anything. 

I can’t calm down, though. I keep thinking I’ve done something wrong with my dog. Why is she like this? She kept trying to jump on the officer, too, because he didn’t talk to or acknowledge her. He was thankfully okay with it, and said she was just being protective. 

I’m not sure what more to do with my dog. It seems that I always need to have her electronic collar on her, no matter what now. I feel like I can’t take her back to the park anymore. I just feel so defeated. This doesn’t feel like a step back, more like a leap. 

Also, I’ve never seen her jump on people like that. When she was younger she’d try to jump on them, but I got her out of that habit. She doesn’t jump on our neighbors, they’re all great and kneel down to talk to her and pet her. The whole thing was just out of character, and yet not out of the realm of possibility for her. 

Thanks for reading. I think I’m going to cry in the shower now. "	dogs
1169	[Help] dog repellent for edge of lawn	"I live on what would appear to be the most popular dog walking route on earth. It's a corner lot and people constantly let their dogs pee on the edge of my lawn. It's very disrespectful and the ones I've caught in the act, I've talked to, but there are many I miss. I have many brown spots on the edge and am losing the battle because the grass seed doesn't grow fast enough.

I cannot build a fence on my front yard due to town ordinances.

I'm searching for a solution. I've read about the ultrasonic ones but it seems kind of cruel, though I may resort to this. I have tried spraying chili powder, but I read that is not great because if they do go on it, they can rub it in their eyes etc.

What could I do? Most of the ""dog repellent"" sprays on Amazon have bad reviews.

1170	[Discussion] Is patting a dog on the top of the head unhealthy for them?	"My girlfriend's dog is a (almost) three-year-old Belgian Malinois. He loves aggressive play and petting. She takes issue when I pat him on the head. I pat him firmly but not roughly. He smiles and leans up into the palm of my hand and begs for more when I stop. He will manipulate my hand back onto the top of his head in various ways. She seems to think I could injure him doing this. I have always done this with the dogs I've owned who enjoyed it. That is to say, the dogs who do this same behavior: leaning up and into the pats. I like to think I can read a dog's body language/behavior pretty well. He also enjoys noogies and she doesn't correct me for that. I couldn't find any clear answer to whether this might hurt him so here I am. Of course I don't want to hurt him.

1176	[Breeds] Looking for recommendations for breeds that will suit!	"# Introduction

Hi all, we're considering getting a dog next year and doing our research into what breeds might be a good fit. Our dream dogs are huskies and we'd love to have one, but we're not sure they're a good fit for our situation - would love advice on that and suggestions for any other alternative breeds that might be a good alternative. Thank you for your help :)

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No - I used to have a Jack Russell, who was a bit of a handful due to lack of training and suitable care by his previous owner (they kept him inside a small flat 24/7 so he was scared of everything). He was wonderful with me, but could be anxious/overly protective and barked a lot at men and big dogs. I trained him as much as I could but I was young and inexperienced and I didn't know how to train him properly (nor did I have the money to take him to a trainer). Now that I am older and hopefully wiser, and in a much better financial situation, I am keen to make sure that we do the research and take the time to make sure that whatever dog we get is a good fit and well trained.

This will be my husband's first time owning a dog.

**2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/**[**http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**)?**

We would rather rescue if possible. We're leaning towards getting a dog that's 1-2 years old, rather than a very young puppy, due to not being able to be at home enough to look after a puppy.

**3)	Describe your ideal dog.**

A happy, playful dog that likes affection but is also willing to just chill sometimes. A dog we can take to social events and can be well behaved around other dogs &amp; children. Ideally fluffy, medium sized and wolfy looking :)

**4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

 Looks-wise, we like 'wolfy'-looking dogs most. We both absolutely love huskies and this would be our top choice, but I've done a ton of research and we're not sure if it'd be a good fit for our situation. I'm also a big fan of Shiba Inus but am worried about the aloofness! I also like the look of German Shepherds but the breed restriction issues put me off. We like labs and collie-type dogs as well, and we're not fans of small dogs like chihuahuas.

**5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Just basic commands - sit, stay, stop etc. If they like learning more commands or tricks then great, but not a requirement

# Care Commitments

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

During the week, a couple of hours a day. On the weekend, pretty much the whole day most of the time.

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

We'd be looking to get a dog walker (probably daily) for weekdays. I'd also be up for a short walk in the morning, and another longer one in the evening in the park, depending how much exercise is needed. We live opposite a (smallish) park (30 seconds away!), which has an unfenced dog area. On the weekends, we might do the odd hike or go to a bigger (fenced) dog park.

**8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Some brushing would be ok - few times a week. Willing to do grooming at home but may also pay a professional, depending how tricky it is.

# Personal Preferences

**9)	What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium - probably up to about 60 pounds. We'd consider something a bit smaller (30 pounds maybe) but we're not really into small dogs.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Some shedding is ok as long as it's manageable with a robot vacuum and a weekly house clean! Some barking is ok but we do live in an apartment block so it couldn't be excessive (the block is dog friendly, and we only have neighbors on one side and above - next door neighbor has a dog - but I think we'd get complaints if it was barking constantly). Would prefer  a minimal amount of slobber.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It would be more convenient to be able to but it's not a deal breaker.

# Dog Personality and Behavior

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

We'd like a dog that is affectionate and likes being petted - ideally one that'd sit near us when we're on the sofa, for example - but it doesn't need to be a lap dog!

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Slight preference for eager to please but not totally sure.

**14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

As long as it's not aggressive towards visitors, we don't mind.

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Chewing, excessive barking, aggression towards other people

# Lifestyle

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

On weekdays, we both are out from about 8 to 6. However, there is some flexibility - some days one of us can probably work from home some or all of the day. We will get a dog walker for days we are going to be out the whole day.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My husband has similar preferences to me, but is less dog obsessed than I am - but he likes them and is up for getting a dog. He's willing to share responsibilities but I think it's likely I'll do a bigger share of the 'work'.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

No. Maybe in future we'd get another dog but not until we were in a bigger place, with a yard.

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not regularly at the moment but we have friends with kids, and it's likely we'll have kids in a few years (i.e. within the dogs lifetime!)

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We rent and are allowed 1 dog, with no breed or size restrictions. We live in a fairly large 1 bed apartment. There is a small communal courtyard, but otherwise we do not have a yard. We will likely continue to rent for a few years, and then we'll either be buying or moving back to the UK where we're from (we own an apartment there).

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

we live in san francisco, california.   There seem to be some rules around pitbulls, and potentially insurance issues with some breeds.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It's moderate most of the time - average low in winter is 43f and the warmest days get to 80/90f

# Additional Information and Questions

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

We're really keen to make sure we make the right choice and get a dog that we can provide a good home for for life. We are willing (and expect to) take a dog to training classes and socialise it early on.  We will travel back to the UK 1-2 times a year - we have friends who may dogsit, or will take them to a kennel if not.

Thank you all for your help!"	dogs

1181	"[RIP] Gertrude (""Gertie""), Chihuahua, ~3 years old..."	"[Good Girl](https://imgur.com/JfOYGUF)

I know this is long, but she was my first dog friend and I'm not even a dog person. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First, I think it's fair that you know I'm a cat person. I never had a dog as a child, I was attacked twice by large dogs as a child, and in general it's hard for me to get past that ""dog smell"". BUT that's what made Gertie so special. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In late 2015, we found her wandering some rural back roads freezing and starving. Even though I'd never had a dog friend before, I love animals and I certainly couldn't leave her out there. So we scooped her up, put her in the warm car, and drove around knocking on doors and trying to find her home. It was getting late and dark so we decided to take her home for the night and call shelters in the morning. I had a 4 month old at the time who was exclusively breastfed, so many nights we would sleep on the couch or in the rocking chair. This tiny little chihuahua just hopped up and snuggled right in with me on the couch. I'll never forget it - how happy she seemed to be warm. her big, bug eyes looking up at me whenever I got up. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the morning I called the county shelter. They said that where I found her was the next counties jurisdiction. So I called them. They said it was my counties responsibility. So I made flyers and went back to the road to see if anyone was missing her. She was so tiny - only about 2lb at the time. I called some other rescues, but no one had room or didn't want her. So the kids and I took her to the store and we got her a nice coat, some booties, and some toys. She wouldn't eat dog food, but seemed to like the cat food (our cat wasn't too big on the idea, however). My aunt is a vet so she said cat food would be ok if she wouldn't eat soft puppy/dog food. (She never did. She wouldn't even eat the special Chi mix). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 weeks go by and still no sign of her first home. We were already potty training her. The cat had finally warmed up to her (or given in...). Just wiggled her way into our hearts just like she did with the covers. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We were still calling her dog, so we though up some names. She made me think of that scene in 101 Dalmations about them watching the people walking their dogs on the sidewalk and how they looked like each other. I imagined she was owned by an ugly old woman with a nasty disposition and the name Gertrude just stuck. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now, Chihuahuas aren't exactly energetic dogs. She didn't quite understand fetch and didn't like to play for too long. Once around the block was enough for her. But Chi's are loyal and protective. She guarded our house and sidewalk and yard and garden and trees and fence...like nobody's business. So in April this year we moved. The new house had a fenced in back yard, but some of the fence was spaced out. So we put chicken wire around the bottom. She kept getting out and damnit it all if random people didn't bring her back home. We live a few doors down from a grocery store and she would frequently wander over and bark at people as they came out. If we were out working in the yard or the garage, we would let her out and she would stick by us. If we weren't out there she thought she owned the block. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The problem, is that we live on a busy one way. And my husband let her out this morning while he was working in the garage and he forgot she was out there. The kids and I were inside cleaning and I didn't even notice she was gone (she usually hid from the broom, but was the vacuums superior). I saw a police car out the window roll by, stop, back up. He got out. *that's weird. what's he doing* You couldn't see her or the ground because there was a bush in the way, but he stepped to the side *no...* and there was a thin, dark blue thing in his hand *no no no no* my heart sank like the Titanic. I knew. I ran out the door and I saw her tiny little 5lb body lying there. I didn't know what to do. She died all alone (though probably instantly). It looked as though someone had placed her on the grass between the sidewalk and curb. Who could do that and not see if anyone was around that loved her? 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My heart is absolutely broken. My 12 year old son is devastated. They were best buds. Top it all off it was his birthday party today. He cried when he went to bed as she slept with him almost every night. I usually stay up late doing homework or housework or work work and she would sit with me until she was ready for bed. I liked how little and cat like she was. She fit so perfectly in my lap. I really never thought I would take this so hard, but it's very quiet in the house right now and her little bed she never slept in (but humped violently) is empty. Her toys just sit there. Her little pink jacket with the fur around the collar is hanging on its hook with her pink leash with the little bow. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was a good girl. I really don't know what to do..... We buried her this morning in the family pet garden. I chose a nice spot under the zucchini plot. I think she'd approve. My grandma made her a little cross. My mother and brother came - she loved them so much and would go so excited whenever they came round. She was the perfect dog for this cat person and I'll never have another like her. 

And it's raining and she's in the cold ground getting all wet and she's alone ..."	dogs
1182	[help] tips for bringing home a new dog	"We are bringing home a 2.5 yo pit bull to be BFFs and playmates with our current 2yo pit bull. She’s coming home in about a week.

1183	[Help] humping problem	"Hey dudes, i'm having a little bit of a problem with my dog... he tries to hump every single male friend that enters my home. He hasn't done this with me or any other member of my family, only my guy friends. I know this isn't a dominance thing, it doesn't even look like he does it to relieve himself of stress or because he is too excited, he just starts doing it out of nowhere. 

I've tried to make him stop, scolding him as soon as he starts getting down to business but it doesn't seem to be working. What could be causing this behaviour? Can I do something to stop it?

He's 3 years old and I've adopted him only 2 months ago, so I don't know if this behaviour was reinforced by the family he has lived with the first year of his life"	dogs

1185	[HELP] My dog suddenly has terrible smelling breath and won't stop licking his paws.	"My dog, Spike is a mix breed we rescued from a local shelter a year ago. We estimate Spike is 3 years old. He's supposedly yellow lab &amp; Australian Shepherd.

Yesterday I got home from work and I noticed his mouth was extremely smelly. Almost like Garbage! We went for a walk and I ended up rubbing his snout. I got his odor on my hand from his mouth and couldn't take it! It was like everything had this stink.

I noticed he was licking his front paws a lot when we got home, and the smell got so bad I had to stop eating dinner... Last night I woke up and he had licked his paws so much that our bed sheet had a huge wet spot and again the smell was awful.

We are planning to take him to the vet, to have a tooth cleaning done but we can't get in for a few days. Is there any recommendations. I have never brushed a dog's teeth but I was going to pick up some supplies after work today to attempt a good brushing. Any other suggestions?

1186	[Help] Puppy possibly has intesusception	Hi there.  I have a 5 month old Tibetan Terrier who I have to take to the Emergency because she had thrown up all day.  We took her there and that vet said she possibly has an intesusception and we could have her put in hospital to be monitored and have surgery.  It was 3000-6000 for that.  We ended up deciding to take her home with medicine and to monitor her as the xrays they did still didn't confirm if it was intesusception or just gastroenteritis.  She has pooped a normal poop after we took her home, still has an appetite, is playful, but has since puked twice in the past two days.  I'm going to see our vet tomorrow, but I'm worried that I'm making the wrong decision by not taking her to the hospital to be monitored.  Shes not in pain at all as far as I can tell.

1187	Adoption guilt and regret. [Discussion]	"After speaking with my SO and several other people who have gone through similar feelings, I’ve decided to post. Please read to the end before making judgements. 

My SO and I adopted a dog in late June. We had been discussing adding another animal to our family (we have a cat) and decided on which shelter to adopt from. We gathered all necessary supplies for the general breeds and sizes we were most interested in (toys, bowls, treats, etc.) and went looking at the shelter. We looked and interacted with almost every dog regardless of breed, size, and age. 

We both really connected with a dog that had only been at the shelter for a day. Texas has a law that all animals brought in as strays must be kept on a 3-day hold for observation and to give owners a chance to find their lost animals. The morning he was available we were there ready to adopt. We signed all the paperwork and were set to pick him up 2 days later (he needed neutering and his shots). 

I felt an extreme amount of guilt about adopting a dog that hadn’t been at the shelter for very long. I felt guilty that the dog we choose was a “desired breed” instead of a pit bull type dog. I felt wrong calling him a rescue dog when he hadn’t been at the shelter for longer than a week. 

The day we’re set to pick him up I get a call that his heart-worm test came back positive. We decided to adopt him anyway, despite what we thought would be a major financial set-back. We were lucky enough to find out the shelter partners with local vets to provide no-cost treatment to animals adopted from their facility. That was truly an unexpected blessing and something I’m incredibly grateful for. 

Once we got him home and took him to our vet of choice for a check up we found out he also had hookworms and a case of kennel cough. He also proved to be very hyper and energetic. 

Th first couple of weeks after we brought him home were hard. On top of the guilt I felt for not choosing an older, longer stay dog, I also felt like I didn’t adequately prepare myself for having a dog in my life. He was a lot of work and had a lot of energy I wasn’t fully prepared for. He didn’t have any training so he had accidents and didn’t know not to chew on things. I hate to admit it but there were days when I did feel regret about adopting him. 

After having him for a little over 2 months now, I can say all those feelings evaporated. He is the joy of my life. The work and effort we put into training him really paid off, and he flows well into our daily lives and routines. He is now hookworm free and starts treatment for his heart-worms next week. I don’t feel guilty about choosing him over other dogs at the shelter anymore. By simply adopting a dog, I opened another space at the shelter for a dog in need. At least two people have also adopted from that shelter because of how highly my SO and I speak about it. The reason I’m choosing to share this experience is because I was ashamed to admit I had these feelings. But, I think they’re completely normal because adding a living creature into your life who depends entirely on you is a major adjustment that takes time. If you also feel this after adopting, just stick through it and establish a routine. After a few weeks you’ll feel like you’ve always had the dog with you. 

TL;DR: I felt guilt about choosing my dog over any other at the shelter. I also had feelings of regret because of how drastically different daily life was. After a few weeks these feelings evaporated and I can’t imagine life without my dog.  "	dogs

1189	[HELP] Advice on Nationwide dog insurance	"Hello there!

&amp;#x200B;

We just received our first puppy and wanted advice on pet insurance. My work provides Nationwide My Pet Protection (30 per paycheck/60 a month) and My Pet Protection with Wellness (50 per paycheck/100 a month). It seems to cover accidents &amp; illnesses, hereditary &amp; congenital, cancer, dental diseases, behavioral treatments, Rx therapeutic diets &amp; supplements, special &amp; er with 250 annual deductible and 7500 max benefit. The wellness plan adds wellness exams and shots.

&amp;#x200B;

Confused if this is better than Nationwide's regular Major Medical or Major Medical with Wellness Plus. Both are cheaper at 31/mo and 50/mo but I'm not sure how they differ from the My Pet Protection plan. Also wondering if it's worth us getting another insurance such as Healthy Paws (on research seems a lot of people recommend that).

1190	[Help] Taking in an unaltered, untrained dog	"Hi everyone! 

I have finally convinced an aquaintance of mine to let me take her dog off her hands. He is a 4 year old Chihuahua mix that has been to a vet once and is not neutered, so that is something that is going to get done as soon as I have him. He has spent the majority of his life contained to one room and has very seldom gone for a walk, so he has virtually no training whatsoever. 

I had dogs my entire childhood but the training and vet stuff was taken care of my parents - they were all fixed as soon as they safely could be and trained while they were puppies. I have two cats now and he will be my first dog in 5 years. I have no clue where to begin.

So I guess my questions are:

1. He sprays and howls, presumbly due to not being fixed. Are these behaviours that will stop once he's neutered, or is it harder to stop since he's older?

2. I don't even know where to start in terms of training. He is a smart dog but will it be harder since he's older? Would a training class (like the ones at PetSmart) be of any use here?

3. I adopted one of my cats at 10 years old, but she made herself right at home so there was no adjustment period needed for her. The dog is very anxious so I assume he will be nervous in a new home away from his owner and other animals. What can I do to make this transition as stress-free as possible for him?

Any other tips/advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!"	dogs

1194	[help] dog vs cat	We’ve had our 8month old dog about 2 months. Had our cat about 5 years. Cat is not dog-savvy (won’t fight back, always runs) and turns out the dog has a high prey drive. The cat is getting a bit bolder about being around the dog, but still spends most of her time hiding or running. The dog is constantly fixated on the cat.  Looks for her, sniffs around her food area and litter box, stares while she is eating. We’ve been fairly successful so far in preventing chasing and getting her to “leave it”, but are starting to feel like this behavior isn’t ever going to be “trained out” or go away. When she starts to get fixated I try to distract her, get her focused on me, usually make her sit, or lie down, and sometimes do target practice and other small tricks like “paw” to get her attention, but sometimes it’s just impossible to even get her to look at me. I can’t even physically turn her head away she is so focused. What other methods can I use besides distraction to get her to leave the cat alone, or am I just dreaming that this will ever happen, and I’m going to have to keep them apart forever?	dogs

1198	[Discussion] If you have had to put down your dog, did you stay in the room or leave?	"A year ago, I had to put down my dog of almost 17 years. As much as I didn’t want to be in the room, I thought of all the terrible things I’d been through that she was there for, of all the heartbreaks she healed me through, of all the sicknesses she stayed by my side during, and decided there was no possible way I would let her go alone. 

So I stayed. I smiled, and I stroked her fur, and I told her what a good girl she was until I felt her body stop moving and the vet confirmed that was it. I lost it. I had to be dragged out of the vet hospital by my dad, sobbing and barely able to move. It was the worst feeling, the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

That being said... I wouldn’t have done it differently, but I wonder: do most people stay for this? If you did, why, if you didn’t, why not? "	dogs
1199	[help] About to adopt a dog and I see some warning signs. Wondering if I’m viewing this in rose-tinted glasses or if I’m reading too much into it.	"I have been preapproved to bring home a puppy that I’ve fallen in love with. My parents foster dogs and in the past month I’ve gotten a job that allows me enough financial security to own my own dog. I went to meet this dog at their house and fell in love with her. The only step left is tomorrow she is meeting my roommate’s dog to see if they get along. However, there was an incident today that is making me question if I should go through with the adoption.

She is a 4 month old lab, pit, and Rottweiler mix. She was part of a litter of 12 that for the first 2 months of their lives, they were left outside to fend for themselves.

Today we had a lot of people over for Labor Day. She is fine with people, though a little shy. I was taking this opportunity to do some leash training and I was giving her treats pretty frequently to reinforce things I saw as positive, such as looking at me when I said her name, sitting or lying down, or following me when I walked away (before, she would flatten like a pancake when I put the leash on her). There were 2 other dogs that she had been perfectly fine with for the past few days that were walking and standing nearby. I was doing this for maybe 10 minutes when suddenly she snapped and lunged at one of the dogs. However we didn’t realize this is what had happened until a few minutes later when she did it again, because in that second we had all looked away at something else. So twice within 1 minute she growled and lunged at a dog. 

I put the treats away after that and she went back to normal. She was playing with the other dog just fine after that. 

I asked her previous foster if she has ever seen food aggression in her. She said once, she was eating in her crate and another puppy walked by and she growled at him. She said she never saw her show any aggression outside of the crate. 

I have fallen in love with this puppy and I would hate to back out on this adoption. Common sense is telling me that I should not take on a dog with an issue like this. Outside of this food aggression towards the other dogs, she is perfectly fine towards people and seems very easy to train. 

I guess my question is, how easy is this to manage, really? Could this aggression spread to toys or other possessions, and become aimed towards people as well? Do the pros of owning a food aggressive dog outweigh the cons? 

Bear in mind she is expected to mature at around 80 lbs. If I adopt her, I will enroll her in training classes. IF her aggression gets worse, her size could make her quite the handful. Or am I reading too much into these 3 instances?

like I said, I really really like her otherwise.

Any insight would be appreciated :) "	dogs
1200	[help] My dog’s acting weird and not at the same time. Should I be concerned?	"My dog is an Australian Shepherd and border collie mix and is about a year a half old. My SO and I have had him for about 6 months now. He’s been relatively healthy aside from some illness he wasn’t treated for at the shelter (which was quickly taken care of with medication) and a hot spot a couple of months ago.

He used to love drinking water and would do anything for an ice cube and would drink his bowl of water as soon as it was set down. Lately he doesn’t care for ice cubes and he barely drinks his water but still goes for the puddles outside.

Over the past day or two he’s also been laying in more enclosed spaces. He doesn’t normally sleep or lay in his kennel on his own but the past few days we’ve found him hanging out in there. This is a little weird to us since he doesn’t normally like going in there. He also tried jumping behind a chair just to sit in the corner of the living room. 

There’s a recliner that’s near the corner of the room and the couch directly next to it so the only way he can get back there is jumping down from the arm of the couch or squeezing between the two. He used to go back there just to lay down and put his head under the back of the recliner but we decided we wanted to stop that so he wouldn’t get hurt in any way. He’s good about not going there but today he forced himself past me just to sit back there and pant.

This is the next thing: he’s panting more often now. It’s summer in the south so I can understand him being hot outside or panting because he’s excited about guests, but the apartment is cold and he’ll pant just sitting around. It’s one of those things where I can’t imagine why he’s worked up so it worries me.

My SO recently moved into the other bedroom in their apartment and someone else has moved into the new room (who the dog loves). Over the past week our dog has been laying outside the old bedroom more and I don’t know if it’s because he think it’s still his space, if he trying to sniff out the new roommate and his cat, or if it’s something else. 

He’s still playful, eating, and desiring just as much as attention as usual, but something feels a little bit off. I don’t know if we need to take him to the vet but I’m feeling like we should. He’s a little sleepier today than usual but I can’t tell if that’s something wrong with him or he’s just having a lazy day.

Are these things I should I worry about? I don’t know if I’m being overly concerned or there’s something we should really be looking into. Googling isn’t helpful since the answers are either “it’s just stress” or “they’re dying and it’s time to be sad.” Should I take my dog to the vet soon? Any help is greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Tonight we’ve noticed he’s been holding up a single paw sometimes when he sits. He’s switched paws a couple times too. He’s not limping, not pulling away or yelling in pain, and there’s nothing stuck. He did trip going up the concrete stairs earlier so he might have stubbed a nail or landed weird and hurt his paw a little. 

We are going to the vet as soon as possible to get him checked out.

EDIT 2: took him to an emergency clinic since we were worried. Doctor said there’s no physical issues she can find. She said it could be some anxiety since there’s a huge storm that’s rolling in this weekend and the barometric pressure is changing. "	dogs

1202	[DISCUSSION] What do I do about my dog and her lip problems	My dog is 9 years old and since around 8 months ago, she has developed scans around her mouth in the lip region. I think she got them after getting in a fight with a Pomeranian or after I gave her some chicken wing bones which she usually knaws on but that time she crunched them up sharply. Since then she has had the habit of scratching her lips to try and remove the scabs but she doesn’t realise that she is making it worse. A dog can’t remove a scab perfectly without it making it worse. She digs in deep and gets her lips all bloody and I then have to get a tissue to clean her up. She’s just making it worse for herself. I have tried negative reinforcement by giving her a small slap on the head every time she does it but I hate doing it and she doesn’t even care. I took her to the vet and they said to use a cream but it wouldn’t matter. The scabs would still be there and she would still make it bloody restarting the process. My only idea is for her to wear a mussle but I don’t want to put her through that. 	dogs

Hello everyone. We just recently got a 5-month old beagle who's been with us for a week. When we got him he had reddish skin and was itching all the time, so we took him to the vet last weekend and the vet told us he has yeast infection. We bought some medicine that the vet recommended but when I was reading online about this infection, I read that diet should also be adjusted to help him get fine quickly. Currently we feed him kibble from Holistic Recipe (that's what the prev owner told us to feed him) and I found out that kibble should be avoided to help him get rid of the yeast faster.

Can anyone who has had yeasty dogs provide some tips on what you fed and what you did to help him get cured? Really felt bad about his current condition since his hair is starting to get very thin."	dogs
1204	When is it time to let go of your dog? [Help]	"Background: My fiancee and I adopted our dog from a shelter more than 6 months ago. The dog is a border collie mix, estimated to be 4 years old. The previous owner of the dog died leaving our dog and another. The dog was aggressive since we brought him. Whenever he doesn't like a touch from a human or another dog, he would snap and nip on the hand. We had a behaviorist coming home to see his behavior. The behaviorist said (after hours with him) that it is alright. The behaviorist added that nipping is the way to warn you that he doesn't like what you are doing. We live in a spacious 60 square meters appartment with no other pet. We take him out at least 2hrs per day. We walk with the dog out 4 times per day spread across the day. The time outside is split between playing scavenger hunt in the dog park (when the dog park is empty) and walks on a 5m long leashes so he can explore comfortably and safely. We try to make the time indoor as stimulating as we can. Keeping indoor time stimulating is really hard specially that our dog does not like any toy, we manage though with kongs and some kibble in a box with cloth tht he digs in for hours.
We spent the last six months of our time trying to avoid whatever annoys the dog. We used muzzle when we had to do something he doesn't like (nail clipping, vet visits). All fine until two days ago. I was combing the dog's hair (like we always do) and I believe I touched something that caused him pain. The problem is, this time he didn't nip or showed teeth. This time he full on went to bite my finger. I had to hold him by the neck to leave the finger. This is not the first time the dog bites me, it is just the first time he is so intent to hurt. My index was almost chopped.
I am not angry about that accident. I know that my dog loves me and that he trusts me. I am just afraid now of the future. There is no set of things he hate, some times he will turn crazy for no apparent reason. The dog does not intend harm, but he might hurt my fiancee (who leaves with me) or another dog or even worse.
We are cautious with him all the time. We never let children or small dogs approach him. I am just afraid of one time that something unexpected happens and the worst occur.
I love my dog. I am willing to take more bites (if it doesn't cause permanent damage). I am just wondering when to decide that the dog is a hazard or not safe. I am not angry or emotional in anyway. I just want to avoid serious injury for someone. I can't muzzle the poor animal all the time. I can't re-home the dog either since other people might not realize how aggressive he can become. When should an owner consider putting the dog to sleep?
TLDR; An adopted dog is aggressive even after many months of living in a safe environment. I am afraid of the dog causing serious damage to us or someone else. When should an owner consider putting the dog to sleep?"	dogs

1210	[discussion] Adding a second dog to the family	"My fiancé and I have been discussing getting a second dog, but I keep backing out in the fear that our current dog won’t be happy. We have a 3 year old dog at the moment who is the most perfect, big baby. She is a 50 pound mutt that we adopted when she was 6 months old and we think she is a boxer/Rhodesian ridgeback mix. She is the sweetest and laziest dog ever at home. She sleeps all day, loves to cuddle, and loves being with her people. We have a dog park at our apartment and we have never had a problem with her and other dogs - she loves them all, ESPECIALLY small dogs. 

All of this gives me hope she’d be ok with adding a second dog to the family, but she’s just so spoiled I’m scared she’d get mad at us. She sleeps in bed with us, gets all the cuddles she wants, she even cries while we play with our hedgehog each night because she wants all our loving. 

Anyone have any personal experience or advise on whether we should go through with this or if it would be better to just stick with our current dog as an only child? 

EDIT: when we first adopted her we were living at my fiancé’s house where they have a dog. So she did live with a 6 year old dog for about her first 1.5 years with us before we moved out and she became an only dog. "	dogs

So I talked to a lady that scheduled an interview with me for this Tuesday for a dog training job, and I honestly have to say I'm so much more nervous than I've been for any other interview I've been through.

1215	[RIP] Bonbon, mixed breed, 3	"It's important for us dog owners to accept that our dogs are most likely going to leave this world before we do, but I never would have thought that mine would go so soon. As you can imagine, I'm heartbroken.

[This is her sitting next to a toy lizard.](https://i.imgur.com/eYtfRI8.jpg)

Rest easy, girl. I hope you enjoyed your time here.

I won't go into the cause of death since [RIP] posts are painful enough, so I'd just like to take this opportunity to ask you guys for tips and advice when going through the grieving process, especially from those of you that lost their dogs young like I did. Bonbon was our first dog, so this feeling is completely new to me.

Someday soon, when my family and I have moved on, we'd very much like to get a new dog. Nothing can ever replace Bonbon, but since I've learned so much about pet ownership in the last three years, I figure the best way to honor her memory is to make sure everything she taught us doesn't go to waste."	dogs
1216	[Help] We found this incresibly cute stray dog in Greece, but we cant take him :(	"So me and my family are on vacation in Greece, and we found this stray dog in front of our apartment. He immediately followed us, and we didn't even feed him. He followed us for a few days and he stayed by the pool in the night, and then we decided to feed him in a restaurant, because the owner of the apartments didn't want the responsibility over the dog. Another family came to the apartments next to us, and one of them was a vet. She said that one of his leg wasn't good and that it was broken before, and it didn't heal right. The operation to get it back would cost a lot of money, and he would suffer from it later. She also said that he is about 9 months old and a male, we don't know the breed, but he is castrated, because he has two  tiny cuts in his eat. We really wanted to take him back home, but we decided that that wasn't a good idea, since we have two cats and we live in Amsterdam, which is so much different than here. But we just couldn't leave him here, as he will probably die here, he was so hungry and tired. We love this dog. So we decided to find a solution, one day before we leave. My sister find a 17 year old girl who worked in a restaurant, and she wanted to care for him temporary, but she had to go to college next year, and she already had a lot of dogs. We're going home tonight, so if anyone wants to adopt this amazing and cute dog or give some advice, please contact me. You can also ask for some extra information.

1218	[Help] 11 year old terrier mix with terrible cough. Heart related?	"My family has a rat terrier/dachshund/unknown mix who is probably around 11 years old. We have had him for 7 years and the rescue estimated he was around 4 when we got him. 

Friday night he developed a sudden, severe cough. We thought at first that maybe he was choking but it continued. Its kind of a ""honking"" sound that begins when he's excited/exerting himself and seems to stop when he's relaxed. We took him to the emergency vet and got an exam and xrays. The vet put him on antibiotics and hydrocodone in case he has an infection, but she didn't seem confident that that was the cause. We have to wait for the xrays to be interpreted on Wednesday, but the vet mentioned the xray suggested it could be heart related. 

I know no one can offer expert medical advice, but I'd like to hear other people's experiences. Does anyone have any experience with heart failure or heart enlargement causing a cough?

For one I don’t think maintaining her attention while running will be a problem, walks she can still be distracted but if I even job a bit she follows and doesn’t seem to be interested in anything else. Biggest concern is her joints of course - she’s about 20kg (44+ lbs) now so I’d imagine she’ll still grow until she hits 30kg or so?

1226	[Breeds] SO and I are looking at getting our first dog. Looking to learn to make the right choice.	"Sorry in advance, it looks like I messed up the markdown/formatting.

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, our first.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would rather go through a breeder. We’ve checked local shelters, the dogs tend to be larger than we’re prepared for, and we’re not sure about the emotional issues they may carry.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* 15lb to 20lb, low to medium energy, non-shedding.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My SO is interested in Bichons because of their size. I am interested in labradoodles because I have met some who were smart, moderate in energy, and loving. EDIT: Forgot, she asked me to also include Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Shih Tzu on the list.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Apart from basics, we’d like to be able to let the dog run around without a leash and know that it’ll come back. I’d like to exercise like run or bike with it someday if the dog’s size allows it. We’re not picky.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* On weekdays, maybe 1.5 hours per day. More on weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Can exercise and playing with the dog be done simultaneously?

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* A local breeder suggested the labradoodle might need weekly care or less often, this wouldn’t be a problem for us.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 15lb to 20lb.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The least shedding possible. Barking, maybe not a lot, but some? Unsure about slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is a nice to have, but if we need to stick with a 20 foot leash, we’ll deal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A bit of both.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A local breeder suggested as first time owners that an eager-to-please dog will be easier for us to trian.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Any reaction is fine. It’d be nice if the dog could sit and wait for visitors before approaching. If it can’t, it is not a problem for us to control the dog’s environment so it cannot approach immediately.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No/unknown.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* For the first year, we can limit this to 4 hours, maybe 5. Ideally, 8 or 9.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My SO wants a dog that is more snuggly and smaller. I want one that is more playful and larger.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* We do not have kids. We may someday.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We’re in Midwest USA, no relevant laws apply.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* January 33°F/22°F Aug 84°F/66°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* My SO and I both work full time. Her schedule is erratic and changes day to day, she might work regular business hours or might work later in the day. She occasionally works weekends. I have a more typical work schedule, with options to occasionally work from home. I can come home during lunch, although it would only be about an hour and half of that would be driving.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* We’re trying to figure out how to provide the time and attention to the dog. My schedule is more regular so for now we’re assuming I’d be setting more of the dog’s schedule. A schedule for me today might be waking up at 6:15am to eat breakfast and shower, leaving for work at 7:30am, leaving work around 5pm to head to the gym, and getting home around 6:30pm or 7pm. I’m trying to figure out what I can change to accommodate a dog. Wake up a little earlier and play fetch? Find some way to prep breakfast ahead of time so I can walk the dog and eat in the morning? Invest in a home gym so I can be home earlier in the evenings? I’m not sure how others have gotten by.

We’ve heard that mixed breeds may have a better chance of avoiding genetic health issues that pure breeds have, and we’ve also heard that smaller dogs may be at risk for certain heart disease, but we don’t know how true it is or if that should influence our breed selection or size selection, or not.

EDIT: I don't know depending on the breed or size if running with the dog or biking with the dog is possible once they are fully grown. Doing so is not a requirement, but would be nice."	dogs
1227	[Help] Leash aggressive but okay at the dog park. F(2yrs) “Boxer/ American Staffordshire Mix”. (Looks to be pit mix?) Spayed.	"So my boyfriend adopted a dog that was around one, so now she’s two years old. He adopted her before we started dating, but I am now the primary walker (9.5x/10). She does pretty well at the dog park, but she prefers to sit by us rather than go play with other dogs. When she does play, though, she does seemingly well. I did notice a few warning barks whenever another dog tried to smell her private part. However, when I walk her on the leash, she is rather aggressive to other dogs. I’ve tried calming her down during the situation by reassuring her in a calm voice, which didn’t work for obvious reasons. I’ve also tried simply turning around and walking in the opposite direction which I then learned was incorrect. I’ve tried sitting there to let the dog pass. I’ve also tried walking diagonally away either forward or backward, but nothing seems to work. I would like to be able to walk her like I used to with literally every other dog I’ve owned, but this dog just feels exhausting and now I’m loathing every time I have to walk her. It is no longer enjoyable for me.  She’s this way even with my boyfriend walking her.  Is all lost? Is she just leash aggressive in general? 

If I’m doing something wrong, please let me know. The things I do have always worked on other dogs, but this one has me beaten down and exhausted."	dogs

1229	[Help] SO moved in with cats. Looking for some integration tips.	"We've been living together for 2 months and we are definitely than a better spot than at first. 

Mac is a 90 lb bully breed mix (Am Staff and Boxer according to DNA testing). He's not getting excited anymore when they are separated by gates or if he's kenneled and they come in the room.

Today I tried a leash and harness on Mac and let the cats down on the first floor. Things were going fine for a while. Mac laid on the couch and the cats did their thing. Some curious nose boops were had and even a nuzzle from one of the cats. 

After a few hours Munch (one of the cats) got a little too curious about Mac which peaked his curiosity. She backed off and when he crawled over to her she ran, which trigged him to run. Thus was the end of our little experiment today. Munch went to hiss and growl mode after that. 

I'm not discouraged because that kind of behavior was happening even when separated so this had been good progress.

Anyway. What are some tips to follow for successful integration?"	dogs

[Discussion]	"I left my dog with my parents at an outdoor coffee shop when I went shopping and when I returned there was a woman laid on the floor with my dog stroking my dog who was laid on her back and she was talking to my dog telling her how beautiful she was.

My parents were cringing as it was supper uncomfortable and everyone was watching as it went on for quite a while perhaps 15 minutes soon as I turned up my dog came and sat in between my legs away from her. This isn't the first time it's happened it's happened a number of times and my dog is actually scared of one woman who lives near me as she grabs her head and bends over and presses hers again it and does baby talk to her for an equally awkward amount of time  and my dog physically backs away.

Do any of you come across people who go beyond the usual petting etc into the realms of really cringy and uncomfortable ?

"I've had my 11 year old Labrador her whole life (and I've had my husband for 10 :). She loves us both very much but she is definitely more my dog. Since I've become pregnant (currently 38 weeks!) she has taken to sleeping on my husbands side of the bed. She sleeps on the floor as close to him as possible. She has a bed very close to this but usually prefers the floor next to him, almost under his side of the bed. 

I'm wondering if anyone else's dog has had a change in behavior similar to this when becoming pregnant. To be clear, it doesn't bother me- I just find it curious. She is just as affectionate to me during the day and always wants to be close to both of us when possible."	dogs

He gets a nightly half hour walk (which has always been more than enough for him) or we play fetch/wrestle in the basement.

Now, ever since my GF's sister visited us and left (~2 weeks ago) he rarely eats (maybe once every two days or so), barely plays in the basement and doesn't like to go for walks. Finally, this morning he coughed up some yellow bile. By this point he's lost a bit of weight and we're making a vet appointment this week.

I'm worried about him and wondering if there's anything we can do between now and the appointment.

We looked up yellow bile and everything suggested it was a lack of eating. He doesn't have diahrrea or mucus or anything else.

Anyone else have this happen? What did you do?

1236	[Help] I dont know what to do anymore	"EDIT: Sorry for the long read, Ive posted this on /r/puppy101 as well
Hi guys,


I've been with my Bichon Frise puppy for 2.5 weeks now and I'm at my wits end. Right now I'm living alone because my parents and brother have been on holiday for a while and looking after this little guy has proven more difficult than I could have ever expected. I don't know what to do anymore so I'm venting here :/


Before I picked him up, I did so much research. Trust me, I spent day and night for months reading about raising puppies and Bichon breeds. Finally, I picked him up and since then my life has been consumed by constant overwhelming depression.


To be honest he's not a terrible puppy. I know the problem is with me but I can't help myself right now.


I can't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time which simply doesn't work because by the time I fall asleep, he's awake for a potty break again.


I really struggle to tire him out especially since he hasn't had his second vaccinations so I can't walk him in the park. I try to keep him on a schedule:


9:00 Breakfast and potty


9:30 - 11:00 Play tug, chase &amp; obedience training


11:00 - 13:00 Potty then nap


13:00 - 15:00 Potty then play with toys &amp; obedience training


15:00 - 17:00 Nap


17:30 Dinner and potty, no water from here onwards.


17:30 - 19:30 Nap


Until 22:00 I try to play with him to tire him out with potty breaks every hour and put him to bed at 22:00. Sometimes he literally just flops onto the floor and takes an hour nap before bed time (ruining my plan).
From then onwards he wakes up every 2-3 hours and I take him out then take him straight back to bed. This is where he starts whining and Im just begging for some sleep.


He relentlessly whines if I take one step out of my room. I can't wash my hands, eat, shower etc without him just freaking out. I've tried training him by going out of the room several times throughout the day when he's in his crate but he doesn't show any sign of improvement. I put several chew toys for him to stay busy in his crate but he just ignores them in there.


Im trying to get him used to his collar and leash but once again its proving difficult. He's fine with his collar but as soon as I put the leash on him he freaked out screaming. I didn't even pull him but he started pulling back and screaming. I tried luring him with treats but it didn't work he just put his whole body on the floor and refused to move.


He's shown great improvement in simple commands like, take it/leave it, come here, sit so this has made me feel less incompetent as an owner.


Guys I'm really struggling and I dont know where to turn anymore. I feel so incompetent and can't help but think this was the worst mistake I've ever made in my life. I have no time for myself, I cant sleep, I cant eat, I cant shower, I cant do anything. Do I give him away? Surely someone else out there can give him a better life than me. I feel like I'm losing my sanity! Please someone help me decide."	dogs

1239	[BREEDS] Trying to find a good fit for a second dog, but getting more confused by the day	" 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* We currently have a 10 y/o rescue , who we got about 8 years ago. We dont know her specific mix,but we assume some kind of herding dog or spitz, as she looks kind of like a border Collie, but white. Before her I had a Saluki. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* In our country there really arent that many rescues, and breed specific ones are pretty hard to come by, so we are looking to get a puppy from a reputable breeder. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Pretty low key in the house, preferably low - but up to medium exercise.  My first dog, a Saluki, was awesome,but super aloof and not very cuddly. Would prefer a friendly dog who likes a few cuddles every once in a while. Preferably also a dog who is not too stubborn. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*  We've been looking into a few, but information varies and we're still very uncertain. We have been strongly considering a standard schnauzer, but after reading a few books on them I'm worried about their energy levels. The no shedding is a great plus, but not essential. Basset looked like a pretty good fit for a while, but the health problems seem way too overwhelming, and combined with the stubborness we're not so sure anymore. We have rarely had to deal with any sort of health problem (except old age) with the two dogs we've had, and i dont really want a dog prone to a lot of health risks. The Basset fauve de bretagne and griffon seem healthier, and look awesome - but I dont think their personalities and exercise needs would be as good a fit. Our main choice right now is the English Cocker Spaniel, but i see those too have some health issues. The more we seem to read about a specific breed the more sceptical we seem to get, so right now we just have no idea. We've taken a few breed selectors online, and a lot of them seem to be suggesting Old English Sheepdogs, but the amount of grooming seems pretty overwhelming to be honest. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just basic obedience

**Additional Information and Questions**

Our main issue with many of the smaller sizes is their look (neither of us like the look of the Havanese, cavalier, french bulldog etc) , which we realize shouldn't be super-important, but if there are some options out there for a breed with both the right look AND temper we would love to hear about them and we're hoping for some suggestions. Our top priority though is finding a chill, low key and affectionate dog with low to moderate exercise needs, and which will go well with our older dog (and not go berserk around our chickens).

Eating seems fine, she drinks water. Bathroom is good too. But she seems to not be able to settle down. If she does, it's not for very long before she is back up wandering.

They gave us medication and we used it all as instructed and we thought it was that, but her last one (7:30 pm last night) should be out of her system now right?

I told the clinic the other day, but they didn't seem worried. This is my first dog that we went through the spay together (others had been spayed for a long time before we got them)  so I'm not sure if I should be worried.

She isn't crying or acting if she is in pain. She just seems lost? Unsure what to do with herself? Anyone go through anything similar who can give me any comfort or tips? Should I be worried?"	dogs
1244	[Help] potty training.....?	So I have a male 2 yo dachshund (neutered) who I adopted a little over a year ago. When I first brought him home he would sometime have accidents in the house but I believe that was due to him being kept in a shelter where they were not able to potty train him. Since then, he has learned (somewhat) that he is expected potty outside. That being said, he never has any accidents in the house unless I have guests or other dogs over. He gets jealous and pees in spite almost every time someone is over. He will even do this when I go to my boyfriends for the weekend when he feels he isn’t getting enough attention. He will pee in his kennel sometimes which I find very strange. I am desperate for ways to make this behavior stop.  Any tips or advice is appreciated. 	dogs

Our spaniel has been home for a good few days along with baby. They get on well and she's being well behaved. 

However she's been exhibiting a lot of behaviour that fits with a false pregnancy. Nursing and petting toys, being extra snuggly (she's always been cuddly but she's sort of extra cuddly) trying to make nests... When I'm breastfeeding baby boy she curls up next to us and looks totally blissed out (a bit like baby boy when getting boob). She's also been licking her nipples. 

Not sure if this is normal? She's definitely picking up all the new mum/ baby hormones. 

She's not really showing any anxiety. A bit of curiosity towards baby.

1. [Adopt a dog](https://www.ourdogbreeds.com/tips-for-before-buy-german-shepherd/) from the street or your local animal shelter (And inspire your friends to do the same instead of buying from a breeder)
2. Volunteer in a shelter whenever you can. (Support them with the old newspapers, clothes, food items and toys)
3. Get your neighborhood dogs sterilized and vaccinated (consult the local animal welfare NGO and municipal body on ABC – Animal Birth Control program.)
4. Try to help someone you know get rid of the fear of dogs. Offer them to walk your dog or play with him, dogs shouldn’t be feared. Given how great the dogs are, it is but too short a life to not discover these wonderful friends.
5. Walk up and say *Thanks* to that rickshaw puller, the army veteran, those little kids who care for roadside puppies and that old man you so often see feeding the stray dogs. Let them know that their efforts are appreciated.
6. Assist an ill or elderly neighbor by walking their dog.

1252	[help] taking care of a friend’s dog...did we spoil her?	"She’s been with us for a week. Our routine is I take her out for a morning walk before heading to work, and my mom is with her for the rest of the day until I get back. My mom refuses to feed her the dog pellets my friend gave us and spoils her with rich human foods like milk, eggs, and meat (I managed to convince her to stop feeding her sugary treats, but I can’t be sure she doesn’t while I’m away).

My concerns:

When the dog arrived at our house, her poop came out as a single solid piece, with what seemed like a healthy consistency. Her poop has gradually become small, dry, and harder to pass. 

Especially worrying is that she refuses her regular pellets now, and barely even drinks water anymore (I suspect because she knows milk is on offer).

1257	[Help] How do I fix my dog's behaviour? Need serious help.	"Okay, so in March of year 2017, I made a really immature decision. Against the advice of my parents and a one or two classmates that I knew at the time, I got a puppy. I got him just because I wanted a dog. I underestimated the responsibilities assocsciated and all the troubles that I might face owning a dog for the first time. Things like whom to leave the dog with during vacations has been a great trouble.
The area we live in doesn't have many trainers to begin with and all those who I could find were just very cruel. Their solution to every problem was just using a stick or something to beat the dog.
So I stayed away from them and decided that I have no other option than to train the dog myself.
By the way, I was dumb enough to get a Dogo Argentino as my first dog. As the pup grew, I feel like the pup I got is a mix. 
As a male, he lacks a little height and isn't very muscular, he has brown and black spots and his face is broad but not as much as it should be.
So I used information from internet to train my Dogo mix.
I taught him some basic commands and he was alright in the beginning. But as I said, my parents were against the dog so they never took any effort to train him or look after him, it was all on me. As every puppy has a tendency to bite things in the house even after getting chew toys, he did destroy a lot of furniture and peed in the house. 
So instead of helping me train him against that, my parents left the dog in balcony every time that we had to leave him alone at the house, though I was against it, there was nothing I could do to convince them at the time. Walking this dog has always been a pain. So much pulling. I walked him most of the time but when I had classes or had to go somewhere that I couldn't avoid, my dad walked him and any amount of training that I gave the dog went to waste because he would let him pull and do whatever he wanted.
The street dogs and other pet dogs are a big problem during the walk. They bark at him and try to attack him for no reason and then my dog pulls on the leash more. If he sees the dogs that he's friends with, instead of walking with me to the dog calmly so I can let him play, he'll start pulling and jumping in the middle of the road.

During the time I've had this dog, I've gone out to see my friends very less because no one would care for this dog when I'm gone initially. My friends don't come over much because my dog jumps a lot. He never bites or acts aggressive towards any guest but he just jumps too much with excitement. These reasons have caused me to be very lonely.

With time I've convinced my parents to let him stay inside the house under the watch of our maid when nobody is at home and the dog just sleeps and acts fine most of the time. I've also taught the dog not to pee in the house.But those are the only things that I've had success with.

My dog never eats without the eat command but he has gotten food aggressive over time and I don't know what to do about it. Whenever anybody even tries to walk around his food bowls when his food is being prepared, he starts to growl and show his teeth. Sometimes he even jumps but never bites. This has made my family scared of him. It was so hard for me to get my parents to bond with the dog and now it's all ruined. The dog's behaviour was limited to food previously but now the growling and jumping occurs even randomly for no reason or if someone tries to play with the dog while he is sleeping.

This aggression, his hyperactivity in the house when we are around (he's calm when alone), so much pulling during walks, it's all made it impossible to handle him.

I walk him twice a day daily, sometimes I can't walk him in the morning but it's rare, usually it's 2 times a day. And that walking is just getting harder and harder. The dog is completely fine after a few hours of walk and then is completely energetic again and causing trouble in house. 
Paired with tje aggression it's impossible to handle him.

I'm at the end of my patience now and I don't know what to do, how do I fix his behaviour?
If it wasn't for me, the dog would on the streets by now because my parents are tired of him, my little brother who supported me is also with them now. It's just me stopping them.
We all love the dog but the behaviour is too much.
I've sacrificed my life outside school for my dog and it's just too much now.
I'll be going to college next year and I won't be here most of the time so thw dog's responsibility will be up to my family.
I know that this was rather long but please help me put with these issues. I love my dog and I don't want to let him go.
I just want him to be a normal pet."	dogs

1265	Is this a worm? Corgi has non regenerative Anemia. [Help]	"Hi, 
My dog (corgi age 11)  two weeks ago was very weak. He was taken into emergency room given blood transfusion and spent the night there. He’s currently on atropica and prednisone for non regenerative anemia. His red blood count was 15% it is now 28%. They have done ultrasounds and numerous tests on him to rule out cancer, ticks etc.  

Last two days he started having a very minor nose bleed a few drops. 

He sneezed this out. It was one piece but I accidentally broke it in half when getting it from the floor.  Does it look like worm? It is brittle and maybe 3/4 of an inch long. 

https://imgur.com/a/1OVUzW1

I did take him to emergency room and was left with what looked like an intern who said they had never heard of a worm or anything that could be sneezed out like that and they asked their colleague who said they had not either. They did a quick red blood count test just to be sure his count was still ok but other that said nothing could be done. 

Just wanted an opinion to see if it could be something they weren’t aware of? It looks pretty worm like to me but obviously I’m a layman but they haven’t been able to figure out a reason for his anemia so I was hopeful it was this. I fully realize I might be just desperately hoping for a solution to his anemia.

1271	[Help] Methods for determining if someone will be allergic to a dog in advance?	"My Mom is looking to get a dog. She's a near perfect fit for an owner (works at home, constantly going on walks already, extremely careful, able to give it a ton of attention, etc), with the one big issue being that she's always been allergic to dogs. 

Obviously, she is looking into hypoallergenic dog breeds that might help. But here's the issue, at least as relayed by her (I can't confirm if this is medically plausible, though she is a doctor so generally I take her at her word). Her allergies to dogs varies, depending certainly on the breed, but sometimes she even thinks depending on the dog itself (two separate questions I suppose). Certainly it helps in general to be hypoallergenic (she reacts much less), but it varies a lot depending on the dog, and an individual hypoallergenic dog might cause her just as much trouble as some other non-hypoallergenic dog, it just depends on the individual (obviously, I don't imagine this has thoroughly been tested, this is just her experience when visiting friends and family).

So my question is if there is some sort of method to test for allergies from a dog in advance. Is that a thing? I'd really hate for my Mom to get a hypoallergenic dog, and then find out she's reacting anyways, and have to find another home for it. That's just a poor outcome for everyone involved. Are there any common practices for determining if you'll be allergic to a dog in advance? 

I'm asking broadly for any sort of methods that are used. I mentioned breed vs individual dog above because I think these might be separate issues. I imagine testing for allergy to a certain breed is much more doable, and once that's confirmed she could just look to get that sort of dog. But she really does think that her allergies don't correlated perfectly to breed, and that sometimes she can be allergic to one dog and not another of the same breed,  in which case I was additionally curious if there was ever a way to test for allergies to a specific dog. Any advice or help is welcome."	dogs

    * An intelligent dog who can still be happy in our current situation (apartment living + both residents have a full time jobs). I love all dogs and would prefer a medium to large dog. This dog would be alright spending time indoors during the day and then could go hike or play in the evenings. My ideal dog right now is a more chill but still enjoys to play. I'm hoping for a cuddler as well! I want a dog who is willing to play with other dogs as I plan to have multiple once I live in a house with a yard. Also my ideal dog would be alright living with a variety of other pets. Right now we have a cat. 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * Siberian huskies, German Shepherd's, Australian shepherds, and the like are my favorites but they all seem like the type of breed that would get depressed living in an apartment without a yard. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * house train, manners, come, stay, little tricks, fetch, etc

    **Care Commitments**

    8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    **Personal Preferences**

    9)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * medium to large

    10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * admittedly not too much. My apartment is 1200 sq ft and I think it'd get overwhelming fast. Happy to brush multiple times a week to cut down on shreding. 

    11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Quite! I'd like to be able to go off leash on hikes or mountain bike rides. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * Snuggly (:

    13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * in my mind I want eager-to-please, but I think do is own thing could be happier in my house. 
    
    14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * I would like my dog to be curious but not overbearing. He should not jump up on guests. 

    15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * No

    16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    **Lifestyle**

    17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * I teach middle school and am gone 6-5 M-F. My husband works three 12's and goes to school in the afternoons two days a week. I plan to take the dog to day care for the first month or two until their adjusted to the house and the cat. After that in a perfect world we would leave the dog at home. If not possible we may continue day care. 

    18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * they are happy to help! Most responsibilities will be shared. He probably would prefer a more medium sized dog. 

    19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * We currently have a very large Savannah cat who is very cuddly and friendly. I do plan to get a husky, naid, or German Shepherd in the coming 5 years. We also have an aquarium.

    * Regularly enough, I have a lot of niblings. We also plan to have a kid somewhere in the next 3-5 years. 

    21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I just want to know who will be the most happy in an apartment! I want to do what's best for the pupper. 

Thank you!! 

Edit : thank you for sharing your insight!! It is worth noting that 3 months of the year I do not work so the dog will be receiving 8-9 hours playtime every day. That's only a fourth of the year though so I didn't want to base the breed off of that. "	dogs
1274	[Discussion] My rescue dog recently started mouthing when she’s in a playful mood.	I adopted my rescue dog about a year ago and she has become more and more comfortable at home over the past few months. Recently when she gets into a playful (much more often than in the past), she starts “snapping” at me. She has never actually made contact with my skin but I’m worried if that’s normal behavior. She looks happy and relaxed and not at all aggressive but I’m concerned why she’s suddenly exhibiting this behavior. Any ideas? 	dogs
1275	[Help] My new rescue dog is chewing up everything!	"UPDATE:

I just want to thank everyone for all the advice and information! I thought a lot about how to approach the issue to make everyone happy and decided to see how night crating goes. I left her crate in the living room and she let out a little yelp every 5 or 10 minutes until falling asleep within 30 minutes or so. It was relatively painless. She didn't cry until 6 am when she was up for the day. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will be a good option until she can be trusted more because there are some things that I just can't block her access to in my bedroom at night. I also got her some rib bones, beef hooves and a couple more toys. She will be the perfect dog in no time flat with all the help I'm getting here! 


Hi everyone! 

I brought home a 1 year old golden retriever mix a couple of weeks ago. She has done pretty well... came out of her shell and loves to play, but she is chewing up EVERYTHING. 

Thus far, we have lost a pair of shoes, bluetooth headphones, a phone charger, a vase full of silk flowers, a bag of candy and the wood shutters on my French doors. Last night I caught her trying to chew the corner of my sectional couch. She has plenty of toys and bully sticks that she loves... but the minute I leave her sight, she is headed to cause destruction. 

Most of the items she chewed were retrieved from on top of a table. And if I catch her with something inappropriate in her mouth, she bolts out of sight and acts like it's a game. How do I fix this?

EDIT:
I guess I should clarify that she is crate trained (but doesn't sleep in it) and confined to the living and kitchen area. She is confined to my bedroom at night and everything is picked up, but she crawls under things to find cords or grabs things from higher places to chew. "	dogs
1276	[help] grunting sound when happy?	When ever I scratch her ears or her belly she gets all happy and make grunting sounds. Is this normal?	dogs
1277	[Breeds] Would I make a good owner for these breeds?	"**Introduction**

​

1. *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?*

Yes, it will be my first.

2)	*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a* [*reputable breeder*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*?*

No.

3)	*Describe your ideal dog.*

Medium-sized, with a compact / sturdy body. The coat is smooth, definitely not curly or wiry. Friendly, polite, cuddly; the type of dog that would happily follow you anywhere.

4)	*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*

Primarily Corgis (either breed). They check almost every box on my list in terms of appearance &amp; size, and they are intelligent, trainable, and goofy.

Other breeds I like: Teckel, Beagle, Fox Terrier, Keeshond, Swedish Vallhund. I used to want to own Pugs &amp; Frenchies, but after doing my research, their health problems (and the moral dilemma that comes with them) wouldn’t let me. Chihuahuas seem interesting, too, but my SO doesn’t agree.

5)	*What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*

Basics &amp; more-useful-than-fun stuff first, but I’d like to teach him more complex tricks if he is eager / craves mental stimulation.

​

**Care Commitments**

6)   *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*

2-3 hours dedicated exclusively to him; more in puppyhood, on the weekends, and my schedule permits on that specific workday.

7)   *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*

At least one hour daily (on a weekday) of walking, playing with other dogs, fetch, and soccer. More on the weekends, and if the weather &amp; my schedule allow it.

8)   *How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

I don’t mind brushing him daily, cleaning his ears, trimming his nails, cleaning his teeth etc. I’d let a professional groomer take care of the haircuts, though.

​

**Personal Preferences**

9)	*What size dog are you looking for?*

Medium.

10)   *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

I’m ok with shedding if it’s manageable through daily brushing, diet, and vacuuming a lot. Barking can be a problem (because neighbors), but I’ll do my best to train him not to overdo it since puppyhood. I don’t mind slobber.

11)   *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Not very.

​

​

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12)  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

Snuggly.

13)  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?*

Both are ok.

14)  *How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?*

Any reaction is good as long as it is not hostile. Barking &amp; being suspicious are ok, but I don’t want an aggressive dog.

15)  *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

No.

16)  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?*

N/A.

​

**Lifestyle**

17)  *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

It varies a lot, but at worst, he’ll be alone for 7 hours; at best, someone (my SO usually) is home with him all day.

18)  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

My SO agrees me with me on the size &amp; temperament, but he wants a lower-maintenance dog (a couch-potato). He is slightly less tolerant of shedding &amp; barking than I am. I will be the primary caretaker, but my SO will walk, feed, &amp; play with the dog whenever I can’t.

19)  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?*

I plan on bringing a second puppy to the family, after the first is between 1-2 years old.

20)  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

No.

21)  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

The apartment we live has no breed restrictions AFAIK, as long as its size is reasonable (so no Great Danes probably).

22)  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

We live in Romania. I'm aware of banned / regulated breeds (Pitbulls, Brazilian Mastiffs etc.), but I have no interest in owning those.

23)  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

July: 22 °C / 72 °F &amp; January: -2 °C / 28 °F.

​

**Additional Information and Questions**

24)  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.*

I’m not planning on getting a dog very soon. I want to wait for 2-4 years until my life is a bit more stable (I'm 20 now) + I have a few free consecutive months to raise the puppy. Right now I’m just doing my research on breeds, breeders, and puppy training so I will be ready when that time comes.

25)  *Feel free to ask any questions below.*

1281	[Help] Ways to work on recalls for a playing dog?	"Hey dudes

As expected, my six month old houndish mix is very unreliable when it comes to recalling with heavy distractions around, whether it be people, dogs, other animals etc.

I know he knows what to do, as he has no issues with his commands in a normal environment, what can I do to boost his recalls effectiveness? 

I’m not really looking to off-leash him much, but my neighbors have a pair of boxers he absolutely loves to play with, and no (only invisible) fence. When he was younger he was super good about playing only in their yard, but recently when he gets up and excited he has been leaving their yard, and with a street there and possibly people walking past it could be very problematic. 

I’m cutting off his playtimes until I can work this out. 

I do work at doggie day care, and when he is with me I always try and work on recalls and placing. His recall in daycare has gotten much better, but still leaves much to be desired. 

I know he’s being stubborn, i just haven’t worked out what to do about it yet. 

Any and all help appreciated!

(also just wanted to pop in that yesterday he got barked at and he didn’t reactively freak out, so happy to see some of my work come to fruition!!!)

1283	[Help] Yanked dog using leash?	I have a lab pup about 3 months old, and I was walking her earlier this night when we came across a toad.

I'm getting a harness for her tomorrow, but I didn't know the dangers of yanking/dragging her when walking until recently. I read online that yanking/dragging can cause dogs to have trachea or larynx damage. How do I tell if she's okay? She gets stubborn when I'm walking her, and sometimes she would lie down or sit down to resist the tug, and I thought she just didn't want to walk, so I would yank her up and drag her, not knowing it was hurting/choking her. I now am educated about this and will not do it in the future, but how can I tell if there's any damage from the past?	dogs

1287	[HELP] New dog growls at old dog when he thinks old dog is going to invade his space	"We adopted a new male dog a week ago (1.5YO so not a puppy). Our first dog is a female. They are both generally very submissive and get along quite well. There have been a few growls as they adjust but nothing worrying.

The only scuffle we’re still dealing with is on our couches. We have two in the living room. My old dog does not think anything of bodily contact with me or the new dog, so she’ll lay down wherever. But if that happens to be right next to the new dog (whether she touches him or not), the new dog will do a sharp growl, jump up, and move to a new spot. This only seems to happen on the couches, where space is most limited (as opposed to floor or bed, and I don’t think my old dog attempts to lie as close to him in either of those places for the same reason - there’s just more space).

Do I need to take any action here, or just let him learn to trust my old dog?"	dogs

1292	[Discussion] Buying a field-bred dog for companionship only	"Hi, 

I'm thinking about getting an English Springer Spaniel. I was originally looking more at Brittanys, but my understanding is that the English Springer Spaniels are a little bit less intense. I prefer the field-bred lines along several categories, like the fact that they have lighter coat, are less prone to ear infections, and have shorter ears. 

Since even dogs that hunt are companion dogs the \~9mo out of the year or so (i.e. when it's not hunting season), what are the key challenges to owning field-bred dogs as companion dogs only? I'm assuming they'll have genetically higher prey drives and higher exercise requirements. What are your opinions and insights? "	dogs

1295	[Discussion][Fluff]Expectations	"So today I realized that with my training, and probably in other aspects of life, I expect myself to advance too much too fast, and that may be holding me back. In general when I train with my dog, Calvin, I expect him to learn 1 thing at a time, so training sessions are for just 1 learning task. Today I realized that with herding training I haven't been doing that. I've been working on something, and then expecting him and I to be able to continue to apply it once we get it down in that situation. He's great at holding to the fence in whatever direction he's moving, he's also great at doing a standing stop, and we are working on getting a lie down and turning. I've been expecting to go in with him and him to be able to do the first 2 things just like that, and work on the other 2 things at the same time as him doing those first 2. I didn't realize until today, when my training said ""hey lets just work on either turning, gate manners, or lie downs, we're putting too much on him"", that I was pushing him too hard. And I realized I do this in life as well. When I have to write a program or learn a skill and I've got the basics down, I then expect myself to be able to do everything without struggle and end up frustrating myself because, surprise surprise, I'm not going to be able to do it without more research or concentrating on each aspect, and if I don't realize that I'll never get better at those things. I think I will start to reevaluate how I go about working on things. I had always thought I was breaking them down into their smallest pieces, but I guess today I realized that those pieces all have their individual steps in them that I need to conquer first. As Calvin and I make more progress I will have to remember to not raise expectations too fast, otherwise I may frustrate myself and give up.

1296	[HELP] should I get another dog?	"OK as a huge dog lover i want to get a second dog. The question is when. I want to get one like immediately, of course, but i'm trying to be objective and see whether i'm really ready. Please help in sharing your experiences and give me advice!

A bit about my current situation - I have a year-old male sterilized dog (cocker spaniel mix). He's the friendliest dog ever (he can play with any dog and not a barker at all) with high energy. I live in an apartment and work full time, but we spend a lot of time outdoor and he's mostly sleeping while i'm out. Never destroyed any furniture. He attended basic obedience and did OK. Honestly he's not the best mannered dog like you'd see in obedience competitions but he's alright. He doesn't have any separation anxiety. I take my current dog for various activities - running, swimming, etc, and train him daily.

The second dog I want to get is a female border collie. (I read generally the opposite sex dogs get along better) I know it's a high energy dog and may be challenging. But i'm an outdoor person and I plan to send my dogs for daycare once a week (right now i don't because my current dog doesn't need one)

So if I bring home another puppy now, the dogs will only be one year apart and they will age together. Is it better to have two dogs that are similar in ages or should I wait till my current dog is older?"	dogs

I fear part of it might be that he has bonded so strongly with me he doesn't want to go on walks without me. Is that a thing? Obviously that's unacceptable and he has to go out with my husband.

1301	[Help] 10 year old chihuahua won't stop whining	Hi, I'm really hoping you guys can help me diagnose/fix the problem my dog has been having. My chihuahua will not stop whining/crying throughout the day. He is around 10-11 years old, not neutered, and well trained. I believe I have ruled out worms and fleas since he is not biting his tail or rear end, isn't scooting across the floor, isn't scratching himself, and I've checked his feces several times and don't see any worms or anything out of the ordinary. This problem started about 3-4 months ago and hasn't changed much since (if anything it has gotten slightly worse over time). I don't believe he is injured or in any pain since he doesn't show any signs of pain and the only thing he does when you pick him up is wag his tail and lick your face. He stays inside except for the few times a day when he is let outside for 5-10 minutes to urinate/defecate and to get some sunshine. His urinating/defecating habits haven't changed at all. I've tried researching this problem online and I've basically ruled out any of the problems the different articles list. I also don't believe this is any kind of mental problem since nothing seems to have changed. He is also trained fairly well. He sits and stays on command, and I've also recently trained him to stay when I put a small treat on his nose and he won't attempt to eat it until I tell him to. Does anyone have any ideas what the problem could be? He is driving me absolutely crazy... He whines from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to bed, only stopping when he decides to take his afternoon nap. Yelling at him and spanking him doesn't help at all. I've stopped spanking him since it isn't helping and I don't want to punish him for whatever problem he has since I don't believe it is his fault. I plan on taking him to the vet for a blood test in the next few days. Any advice on any other tests I should have done at the vet? Other than the constant whining the dog seems to be happy and normal. Thanks for your time.	dogs

There's hundreds of street dogs just in my neighbourhood and I can't help them all, but I'm in contact with this one several times a week so I kinda feel a bit of a need to do something. I've started taking some kibble with me (he gets so excited at the sound of the bag rustling!) I was also thinking about deworming with Drontal Plus, and giving Advantix for the ticks. Is this a good choice?

The wound isn't huge or especially worrying from my perspective, but it is sleeping a bit of white liquid. Does anyone have any suggestions for care? Clorhexidine? 

Some other users of the park often see to the vaccination and spaying of the female dogs, so I'm planning on inquiring into whether anyone knows if he's been vaccinated. But is there anything else I'm missing? 

I am toying with taking him to the vet, but I'd like to try to manage the situation without that. Otherwise I'd need to trap him, transport him, board him at the vets, etc, which seems like quite a palava for both me and the dog.

1304	[Breeds] Getting a second dog for my family	"I'm a 19 year old, still live with my family and go to a local college. This dog will be for my family and then come with me when I eventually move out. I understand the concerns of a college student getting a puppy but I have all my classes two days a week, work on my father's almond farm and so have flexible hours (we don't live on the property though) and I have the support of my parents who also will take care of the dog although it is still my responsibility. I know how much of a commitment it is.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, I have a dog currently and my first dog passed away a few years ago. It will be my first time being mostly responsible for training the dog however.

no preference

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Friendly, medium sized and not overly energetic, but not a total couch potato. VERY important that it is trainable and able to be off leash eventually because then I can take it to work at the farm like we did with my first dog. Don't want a brachycephalic dog.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

Ive looked into the spaniel breeds as they seem to more or less fit these criteria, also labs but my family prefers not to have a dog that big

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

General obedience and off leash training

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

On days where I'm not at college I can spend a lot of time with it. On those two days I'm still home nights and my parents and sister will be home some of the time interacting with it.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I can be flexible with exercise needs, but 2 hours on average would be about the maximum I could go. Walks/runs and dog park trips would be included 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Willing to brush regularly, haven't done grooming at home before really but I would be open to trying

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Medium sized, probably under 50 lbs but not super tiny. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Can handle moderate amounts of shedding and average barking. Slobber is a no-go.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Very important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

Would prefer to avoid it

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

Biting

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Hard to say, as all of us have shifting hours of work. But once it is able to be trusted off leash, it won't spend very much time alone. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

They insist on a dog that is under 50 lbs. they will help care for the dog.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

Yes, a pit mix who is very lazy and not aggressive

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Only when my nephews visit

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

When I move out, I will likely rent. So pits are out.

1305	[help] Roaches + dogs: how the hell do i safely do this	"We live in an area of the country that just gets roaches this time of year, and we have an old house, so they get in. So far I tried putting a little bit of diemetacious earth around, which didn't seem to do much, and a bunch of thsoe black plastic traps, but somehow my little dog got ahold of one of them that I'd shoved under the fridge and chewed it up (she's fine! called poison control, she was fine.) But now I'm scared to do anything! 

I crate them at night so I could conceivably set something out in the kitchen  overnight, since that's when they're active. It just seems like every solution I see is pretty well negated by dog needs (don't have standing water, it attracts roaches! well they kiiinda need a water bowl) "	dogs
1306	[help] my dog bit another dog today out of nowhere. how can I prevent this in the future?	"I was walking my two dogs today when I walked past a guy walking his small dog. we stopped to let them smell each other, as my dogs are super friendly and love meeting other pups. they were sniffing each other for a good minute, tail wags all around, when all of a sudden my dog Z decided to bite the other dog on the back of the neck. we immediately pulled them apart and I asked to make sure the other dog was okay, and he assured me that he was and hadn't broken the skin. 

but I was horrified (and embarassed.) Z has never acted aggressively to other dogs before, usually he gives a sniff and then ignores them completely. however he is very excited when it comes to squirrels and rabbits and usually wants to chase them, so I think maybe that's what happened and he acted as if the smaller dog was prey? except he was just happily sniffing him for a solid minute and not chasing him or anything else.

I've had him for a year now, he's pretty well trained on leash and with basic commands. he's so friendly and relaxed, any time I have small kids over he loves to lick their faces and run around with him. I'm just at a loss as to why he suddenly did this. was there body language I missed? he just seemed excited like we he meets any other dog.

for reference, Z is 7 years old, 70lbs, a major mutt but maybe with some great Pyrenees or amstaff In him, not sure. the smaller dog was maybe 20 pounds. do I just have to avoid dogs in the future? is there any way I can teach him not to do this?"	dogs
1307	[Help] My boyfriend and I are getting our first dog , a rescue, what can we do to make him more comfortable? He has some special needs.	I should preface this by saying while this is technically our first dog, we both have plenty of experience pet sitting, raising puppies, and taking care of dogs with special needs such as anxiety. We also have a cat, Jiji who we love like our own daughter. The dog we are adopting is 1 year old, and came from a difficult past. He was rescued from a home in which he was neglected and abused, left in a kennel for most of the first 6 months of his life. We feel prepared to properly socialize him to new experiences, and he's great with other dogs and the rescue has assured us he's lived with cats with no problem. However, he has significant resource guarding issues regarding food and other dogs which we do not have experience with. He is otherwise a wonderful, mellow puppy. We've been told to feed him alone if he is around other dogs but doesn't have issues with people. Is there a good way to train him not to be as food aggressive with other dogs? I would love to hear some advice on positive reinforcement training with issues such as these. What's the best way to introduce him and our cat? I would also love some general advice on making a home transition as easy and comfortable as possible. Thanks!	dogs

He's never bitten or done anything to another dog, but I really don't like this behavior.

1311	[Help] Too many preventative flea, tick and worm medicines to chose from! Concerned about overdose. What do you use?	"My Aussie is currently on Heartguard for heart worms and K9 Advantix II for ticks, mosquitos, and fleas.

I really want to get him on hookworm, ring worm and other worm prevention like what Trifexis does because it’s so hot where we are and there is stagnant water and mud everywhere. But we can’t use Trifexis because it also kills fleas and the vet said our dog could overdose on flea medication when combined with K9 Advantix.

1313	Why do some people get dogs they know are wrong for their lifestyle? [discussion]	"This may end up being more of a rant than an actual discussion. 

At this point I’m used to hearing people say they want a husky, shiba inu, or corgi even if they’re not a great idea for the person. 

Yesterday, I talked with acquaintance who took it one step further. This person, who has very limited dog experience, wants a Caucasian Shepherd. I was immediately confused. How come a person who doesn’t have any livestock, or any land, want a huge territorial dog? Because they look “cool”. I began trying to educate the person, talking about how much training would be needed and how the dog would not like the lifestyle this person would provide (small yard and not enough exercise). Everything I said, this guy said “I don’t care the dog is cool”. I eventually brought up the fact the dog would more than likely bite someone and he thought that was “cool”. I then brought up the fact the dog could, and most likely would, be put down if it happens more than once or if it happens to be a child. 

So what is with this kind of person? I find it absolutely mind boggling that someone could have this thought process. "	dogs
1314	[Help] Medium/long haired mixed breed; How should I trim/groom her?	"Warning: long post

Age: \~1.5 years

Location: USA, Georgia

Breed: According to Wisdom Panel, \~25% Chihuahua, \~12.5% Mini Poodle, \~12.5% Mini Schnauzer, and the other 50% is some mix of Sporting, Herding, and Hound groups.

Name: Diana

​

I know that some dog breeds are alright to trim, and for others it's an absolute no-no and can lead to heat stroke and sunburns. I have a feeling some parts can be trimmed, but other parts shouldn't. I've been tracking her fur growth to see what parts keep growing and what parts stay at their current length.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shedding:** Very mild. Running your fingers through her fur, you'll only get 1 or 2 hairs. When brushing, there's a small amount of fur on the brush, but only about the size of a quarter.

​

**Flanks/Sides of the body:** Short, soft, and dense. Literally feels like dryer lint.

​

**Front legs:** Paws are short but have little tuffs of fur sticking out from between the toes. The tan part feels more wirey, but the black part has that same soft, dryer-lint-esc feeling to it.

​

**Shoulders:** Kind of merge into the neck/chest fur. Not as soft as the other fur, but also doesn't continuously grow. Slightly curly/wavy.

​

**Back legs:** Similar to the front legs, but where the black fur is, it is much longer. It is still that fluffy, dryer-lint texture. Matts very easily. Seems to keep growing.

​

**Hips:** Soft, short fur like on the flank, but with some more hair-like fur on the edges (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing.

​

**Chest:** Fluffy, long, slightly curly. Kind of a cross between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint-esc fur. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Belly:** Very long (like 3 inches), thin hair (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing. Definitely more hair-like than the ""dryer lint"" fur.

​

**Back:** Curly ""faux hawk"" trailing from her neck to her tail. More of a loose curl. Not very dense. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Tail:** Long, thin hair like on the stomach. Seems to just keep growing with no sign of stopping. Strangely enough, doesn't get matted very easily despite being a good 4.5"" long.

​

**Neck/Shoulder blades area:** Similar texture to the fur along her back. Loose curls with a hair-like texture.

​

**Ears:** Similar texture to fur on parts of the chest. Kind of like a mix between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint fur. Soft, but not wirey. Seems to keep growing. Matts VERY easily. I have a miniature schnauzer and she has similar fur on her ears. Grows continuously.

(I tried to get good pictures of everything I want to talk about, but it's hard to keep her still long enough haha.)"	dogs
1315	[Fluff] You know that moment when you come across someone in a hallway and neither of you know which way to go and you awkwardly keep trying sides until eventually one of you stays in one place while the other goes around? That but with dogs.	It’s so surreal when this happens with my dog and I love it. She’s like a little person. She just like lives here and does her own thing most of the day until she comes to me for cuddles or a walk. So when I come across her in the hallway sometimes this happens and we bump into each other and I usually end up being the one to go around her and she stops lol. But for a minute there we have a very human interaction of not knowing which way to go and not wanting to be in each other’s way. 	dogs

1318	[Help] Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia	" Lolly, 5 year old Vizsla on Saturday morning 28/07/2018 started throwing up and having diarrhea, we took her to the vet, who ran tests as follows: x-ray with full anesthesia which showed enlarged spleen (possibly due to anesthesia according to the vet), air in the intestines; blood-work showing low platelets (possibly due to enlarged spleen according to the vet), and that it is not poison; cause of diarrhea / throwing up not established. According to the vet the condition was not critical, even though it was not clear what was wrong, it was advised by the vet to go home for the weekend and come back on Monday to repeat the tests. Later that day at home Lolly was coming down from anesthesia, sleeping/lying down a lot, throwing up, seemed dizzy, had diarrhea, was panting. On the next day seemed very tired, was sleeping/lying down, refusing to drink/eat, panting a lot. On Monday went back to the vet to repeat the tests, x-ray showed less air in the bowels, thick bowel walls, blood-work showed dangerously low platelets. Further the vet established that diarrhea and throw up had blood in it (it was black, so we did not pick up on it on our own, now we know). Lolly was put on a drip and kept at the clinic for further tests. She was put on antibiotics and steroids (Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day). Platelets count went up, overall condition improved, on Wednesday she started eating on her own, on Thursday she went number 2 for the first time since Monday and there was no blood in it, so she was released home with the following prescription: Controloc Pantoprazole 40 mg per day (not to throw up other pills), after that in 30 minutes steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 35 mg per day and Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day. On Thursday 09/08/2018 steroids Corotrope Prednisolone were reduced to 25 mg per day. On 25/08/2018 a drop in red blood cells was diagnosed. New prescription was Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Course of  Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day was completed and no longer required. A week after that, today on 01/09/2018 a diagnosis of Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia was given, a course of  Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Hepatiale Forte 1 tablet per day (in order to protect liver) was prescribed, new appointment at the vet was set 1 month from now. During the appointment ultrasound was performed, enlarged liver was diagnosed (which is also visible, abdomen is enlarged) and impact to the liver was detected due to the steroids.  

At the moment Lolly seems to be not critical, but a bit tired, not very active (she used to play and run around a lot, she doesn't now), panting a lot, walking only for 10 minutes and rushing back home to the air-con, she has very good appetite, drinks a lot of water. Visibly enlarged liver gives us a great concern.

We requested all our data to be emailed to us, once it is done we will be seeking a second opinion, even though we do not have any complaints, our vet seems to be professional and caring (but what do we know?), we just need to be sure that whatever we are doing is right, nothing is overlooked, the diagnosis is correct, etc. Also, we currently live abroad in a small country with not many good  options regarding veterinary care (knowledge and equipment might be also outdated).

Therefor we are asking for any information helpful in this matter, please help! Anybody has any experience / knowledge in this area? What to do? What not to do? How to avoid further damage to liver and possibility of Cushing's Disease? Anything we need to read/know? Any online resources/communities which can help us?

Our Lolly is a very beautiful and precious doggy; she is a rescue, who was found at 2 months old almost starved and with a broken leg, life was not kind to her, but she is a fighter and our very special princess. Please help us make sure that she lives a long and happy life!"	dogs
1319	[Help] Dogs penis leaking uncontrollably	"So my big boy 160lbs Bandit ate a whole salami roll yesterday by accident. I came home with groceries and as I emptied the bags on the counter he must have grabbed it (there is a reason why his name is bandit) without me noticing. I found the wrapper 10 minutes later on the livingroom floor and one happy looking dog. He was absolutely fine for 6hrs until bed time when I woke up in a puddle next to my head. A salami smelling puddle, I was very confused and thought bandit had thrown up but it was clear and just smelled like salami. As I'm walking over to bandit ro make sure hes ok i see him sleeping on his side and clear liquid (i asume pee) dribbling out of his penis onto him and the floor, he noticed 2 seconds later and started licking himself. I let him out and he went for a good long pee. After I let him back in, I change the bed sheets and notice him doing it again. I let him out and he goes pee again for a long time ( I watched him to see if he had to pee). This happened 5 times in the middle of the night over and over again. He would dribble a little as hes relaxed inside and would full on pee a minute long later outside. 

I'm thinking he drank to much water from the salty salami, but I've never seen him full on pee 15 minutes after he just went. His poo looks normal and he is behaving fine too.   Is this going to pass on it's own or do you think he needs to see someone right away?

1320	[Help] Husky Mix is terrified of fireworks	"So, last night my wonderful neighbors blew off some pretty LOUD fireworks. to put in to perspective, it sounded like dynamite. to make matters worse, my dogs including my Husky was in the yard at the time. My other 2 were shaken but seem okay. but my husky seems to have taken the brunt of the nervousness. 

I proceeded to allow him back inside. waited a bit and brought him outside on the leash. He was shaking violently. I brought him into the yard with a leash and my other dogs. No luck. still terrified. When my boyfriend got home, we took them for a walk together. and he did use the bathroom. 

After bringing him in, he ran to my bedroom and proceeded to have diarrhea on my bed. 

This morning he did eat. but he wouldn’t leave my bedroom and he wouldn’t go outside. at all. 

I decided to remove all of them from my house and bring him to my moms. partially cause my mom has an overly confident Lab. 

So far, he’s still shaking. He still won’t go outside. and he still isn’t willing to play.

1321	[Breeds] I don't know a lot about caring for dogs, so want to see if my expectations and preferences are realistic.	"Not to long ago I started saving money so I can get a dog when I move to my own place In a few years, but was told (by people how know nothing about dogs just like me) that the kind of dogs I want would be unfit for the living conditions I'll probably have. There's nothing I want more then to get a dog, but if I need to wait 10 years until I have a bigger house then that's what I'll do. 

**Introduction**

 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs

 * yes.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

 * I would love to a rescue.

 3) Describe your ideal dog. 

* I mostly like medium to large dogs, with a medium coat (I think. Examples are golden retriever, German shepherd, border collie, Australian shepherd) . This is based on looks alone, since other than golden retrievers being friendly I don't know the personalities of dogs, and I feel that most websites don't do a good job describing them. 

 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

* pretty much listed adove. Also husky, but since I live in the middle east Im worried it'll be too hot for it. 

 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

 * probably not more than the basics at first. 


**Care Commitments**

 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* around 3-4 hours I think, but Ill be home with him longer than that.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* Im assuming I'll take it for a walk twice a day, and if its a breed that need more exorcise Ill find someone to walk it a third time when Im not home. And yes we will go to the dog park (as longs is it like to be around other dogs of course).

 8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* as much as brushing as needed. I am open to doinf these things at home, but I think I migth mess it up, especially trimming, so Ill probably pay someone/get a more experienced friend to help me. 


**Personal Preferences**

 9) What size dog are you looking for?

 * as I said earlier fairly large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * shedding is ok, just as long as its fairy easy to clean (does that even change between breeds?). Barking in general is also fine with me, just need to be able to train it to not bark at guests. Slobber I cant handle. 

 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

* I'd like that very much, but its not crucial.


**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

* snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * both I guess? I do need SOME alone time (not in a different room or something, just no playing with it) but I don't want to have to beg for its attention like with a cat. 

 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Its very Important to me that It will be (or can be easly trained to be) clam when visitors arrive and not jump on them. A good friend of mine is very uncomfortable with that and I don't want to be afraid to come to my apartment. 

 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

 * yes, but I feel that it's not a good idea since I'm new to dogs.

 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * I dont think so. Just not jumping on visitors. 


**Lifestyle** 

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

* In a week day probably a few hours. Ill try to use walkers and day cares as much as I can. On the weekend I'll mostly be home all day. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* um.. I cantnreally know right now. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

 * no

 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

* nope

 * No laws like that as far as I know. From Israel.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* hot. Summer is usually 25-30 C°, but very moist (70-80%) so feels like 30-35 C° (all according to our weather website). 


Maybe Im delusional, maybe theres a breed exactly like I want.  I have no idea. Sorry for any English/ terminology or any other mistakes.

Unfortunately I can't take him for the hikes he's used to right now due to recent surgery.  I'm exercising him as much as possible through play of various kinds but it's just not the same  as a good hike and I think maybe this is why he's gotten a little bit chubby- but I'm also not sure if he is chubby or if he's normal?  Idk how to tell he's so little

1324	[Help] exercise ideas	"We have a 6 month old English Setter/Australian shepherd/lad/collie/chow/boxer/had/supermutt mix (we did a DNA test), and our trainer suggested that the reason she's learning commands but her behavior is not improving is need for exercise. 

 We live in the South where its super hot this time of year, and I usually walk her and my older dog for about 30 minutes in the morning and again in the evening, but the trainer said that's not enough for our puppy.  She also wrestles with our older dog, but the older dog is 5 and has bad hips so wrestle mania doesnt always last very long.  The trainer suggested doggy day care, but honestly we can't afford $25/day, so I was hoping maybe y'all had some ideas for some exercises we could do with her that would tire her out without being out in the hot sun too terribly long.

1325	[Update] 3y.o. dog’s sudden fear of going outside has progressed to him eliminating indoors.	"Howdy dog-lovers!

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/9b4n3h/discussion_just_moved_from_tx_to_pa_dog_ive_had/?st=JLJIQQWZ&amp;sh=2f0d0d9a

First and foremost, we HAVE scheduled a vet appointment. I was hoping this was a fluke but now that it’s been a minute he is going to be checked out by a veterinarian for any possible medical causes. Could use some support in the meantime however.

I have also switched from calling Samson’s problem “anxiety” to “fear” because I feel like that is closer to the truth. He doesn’t bark or chew things up or anything of the sort, he just tucks his tail and cowers.

Some background I didn’t give in the last post: Samson is a pit rescue from a kill shelter that was at full capacity when I adopted him. He was so fearful of everyone and everything that I was surprised they categorized him as adoptable and had to leave with him that day before they re-considered. This has never manifested through aggression, only through the cowering/tucking I mentioned above.

The shelter was unable to give us any information on him but I do believe he was an owner surrender in large part because he was already potty trained. Our very first adventure was de-sensitizing him to the presence of humans, and then dogs, and he never once eliminated indoors.

It was about two years later that we moved across the country and I cannot stress enough that he was exhibiting no signs of fear whatsoever at that point. I, and the people around him, considered him socialized and rehabilitated.

His first three weeks went even better than I anticipated. He didn’t like the busy streets and I didn’t push him on that. We walked along the residential ones and through a nearby retirement community. He loved meeting new people and smelling new smells... until this past week he suddenly just didn’t.

Someone asked in the last post whether I had a little patch of yard for elimination and I do! Initially when he was showing resistance towards going on long walks out through the back of our building I tried taking him out to the front, which I have avoided because the street is busier, and that worked. During this time we were doing some re-conditioning with treats and he seemed very amenable to the process.

One night I went out for three hours, got home around midnight. He whined to go out so I took him out front and he urinates. He whined when we got back so I took him out again and he did nothing before hitting his fear threshold and cowering before the door. My initial thought was that I had misjudged what he wanted so we went back in and he continued whining. I tried a few other things and eventually the whining stopped but when I woke up in the morning he had defecated indoors.

Because I was not the one to potty train him I know nothing for certain but can only judge by his reactions that it didn’t go well. The first thing I noticed when I woke up was that he wasn’t sleeping with me. He was in his crate and I couldn’t get him to come out.

The next day I took him out (w treats of course), he urinated, then came back in and defecated within thirty min. I did not punish him because I know he doesn’t respond to that sort of thing.

Last night I loaded up on more treats and cheap toys that he loves to tear up for more positive reinforcement. Again I took him out, he urinated, but I woke up to him having urinated and defeated in the apartment. At the very least he is reacting less shamefully to eliminating indoors, which I am happy about.

When we are inside and he hasn’t had a recent accident he is the exact same happy, silly dog that I know and love.  But as soon as I grab the leash it’s all far. I hoped it was a bad smell emanating from an overflowing dumpster but despite an initial improvement upon it being emptied this doesn’t seem to be the case.

Initially I was resistant to potty pads as it felt a bit like de-potty training him but do you think this would be a good idea? Any advice at all would be appreciated, I am not at a point in my life where I expected to be potty training a dog so I am not as familiar with this process as I would like to be. Please keep us in your thoughts."	dogs

1327	[Breeds][help] Looking For A Running Dog	"I'm looking for dogs that would be good running partners. I run almost every day 3 miles and a 5 mile run once a week. I run at about a 6 min mile pace for my 3 miles so I need a dog that can keep up with that pace. 
I run mostly on pavment but sometimes trails. I live in Arizona and it can get up to 120 degrees in the summer. but I run in either the late evening or early mornings so ground temp shouldn't be a problem for paws.

Other than a running partner I'm mostly looking for a companion that I can hang out and cuddle on my couch with.

I work and shift job, right now I work 4-12am shift. So I have to be able to leave the dog at home for 8hrs. Sometimes I have to work 16hr shifts but usually only once a week. There are walking services in my area I can use during work and if i have to work overtime.

I don't care about shedding or anything I live alone so it won't annoy anyone else either.

1328	[HELP] Is it too soon for us to get another dog?	"Earlier this week someone cut the chain on our gate and I can only assume stole our beautiful boy, Finn. There hasn’t even been a sighting of him and I can’t see anyone going through the effort to break a chain just to be an asshole and let him out. I am absolutely devastated. He is always in his crate when we leave the house but I was running late to pick my son up from school (the street behind us) so I left him outside because he was happily laying in the sun chewing on a bone. I was literally only gone for 10 minutes. I have a dog sized hole in my heart and I hope nobody has taken him for fighting. He is the biggest sook and he’s such a mummy’s boy. He’s familiar with the area from our walks so if he was wandering around I feel like he would have come home. 

A few weeks ago we decided that in the near future we wanted to get a miniature dachshund. But now that Finn is gone I’m heartbroken and i just don’t know if it’s too soon. We have a wonderful small breeder lined up who has a litter planned for about 3 months away from now and we were hoping to get a pup from that litter. Even though we planned this before the Finn disappeared I still feel like we’re replacing him. "	dogs

1330	[help] Can't get puppy back on kibble after bout of diarrhea	We picked up a 4ish month lab mix puppy from the shelter two weeks ago. After a bout of diarrhea from either eating too many sticks or trying to slowly switch to a different food (we were doing a really slow transition from Purina One to Taste of the Wild), we put him on chicken and rice. That gives him solid poop. Once we put even less than an eighth of a cup of his original kibble (Purina One) in his bowl, the diarrhea comes back full force. Once he clears his system, we give him chicken and rice and he's doing ok. We will call the vet on Monday when they open but are looking for some tips to make our puppy feel better. We've checked for mold in the food and he had recently gotten a monthly dewormer at the shelter. Any ideas on what would help? 	dogs
1331	[HELP] How often does a negative change of behavior after spaying a female dog occur? Is it as serious as it sounds?	"Hello! I've recently adopted a female adult dog. One of the shelter's requirements is that I have to spay her. I had  no problem with it, but recently I've read that female dogs can get more agressive and territorial after spaying and I kind of hate that idea. She's a small dog and likes most dogs in my neighbourhood. Being agressive could also be a threat to her, since most dogs around here are bigger than her.

I've only had male dogs up until now and any change in behavior after neutering was usually for the better - they would get more friendly towards other male dogs etc.

So right now I am getting seriously concerned about all this spaying business. I have to spay her anyway, but I wanted to ask if I have a reason to be worried or is agression in spayed dogs actually not that common?"	dogs

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* My husband and I both grew up with family dogs but we havent had any as adults. My mother bred Pugs and spaniels so I have a reasonable exposure to training etc (but again, not for quite afew years!)

*  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Affectionate and cuddly as well as independant enough to not destroy the house if left afew hours. Active enough to enjoy playing with the children/going for long walks but not requiring hours and hours of exercise.
* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* Japanese Spitz - They seem a good mix, friendly and affectionate as well as easily trainable, their easy-care coat is a big plus too.

*  7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \*  I go for a walk most days but could easily do 2 most days. (probably 90 mins total-ish) The children would play with the dog alot too but I wouldnt want to count on this as exercise.  
* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I would prefer a reasonably easy-care dog. Brushing afew times a week would be fine, maybe a proper groom afew times a year but not much more than that.

*  9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Small to medium (I dont want too small, husband doesnt want too big :P)  10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* As little as possible of all 3  
* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Not terribly important, it would be nice to not have to worry about but also isnt a deal breaker at all.  
* \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Snuggly for sure, lots of affection!  
* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* Eager to please - But also would prefer one that isnt too likely to get anxious if let alone on occasion.   
* 14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Having abit of a bark would be fine but I dont want to have to worry about the dog biting or anything like that. A doorbell as opposed to an alarm system..  
* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No  
* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Aggressiveness towards anything.   \*\*Lifestyle\*\*

1340	[help] Fetch on a long leash?	"There are several parks in my area that I'd love to play in with my 5 year old female chocolate lab named Coco. But none of them are closed off.

1341	[Help] Punch Biopsy Kwik powder instead of stitches??	"I went to go see a vet since I felt a lump in my dogs side. I think it was a punch Biopsy that was done but he said he put some kwik while it healed.

Obviously my dog licks his wounds and this is what it looks like.

Surely it's not suppose to be exposed like this right?? I read online that normally they'll stich it up, leaving it exposed like this would probably get infected.

He said he looked at it under a microscope and the lump is benign.

Still, throwing kwik stop powder seems a bit half assed.

I'm gonna drop by tomorrow to pick up my dogs medical records and find a different vet that can stitch up my dog

1342	[Vent] I'm SO tired of people getting dogs when they aren't prepared for one	"So let me just explain this a little more. I have heard so many stories lately of people getting dogs and then complaining when the dog...is a dog. Or the most frustrating, when a puppy is acting like a puppy. 

For example: A woman I'm in a Facebook group with is freaking out because her 17 week old puppy ""pushed over"" her young daughter. Well, a puppy isn't going to purposely push over a child. She's worried about her daughter being hurt. Well, if you were worried about that, then you should've gotten an older, well-trained dog or waited until your daughter was older to get a puppy. 

I get so upset with these situations because these dogs most likely end up getting re-homed, because they couldn't handle it. A dog, and especially a puppy, is hard work...it's basically like caring for a baby. They need attention and if you can't do that, DON'T GET ONE. Ugh. People treat dogs and puppies like toys and it makes my heart hurt so much honestly.

1343	[Discussion] Are we prepared? + BONUS: dealing with staunch #ADOPTDON'TSHOP people	"EDIT: first time poster and just realised this should be a help tag 

Hey Reddit! Sorry for the essay. My partner (21M) and I (20F) are planning on getting a puppy post March next year. It'll be our second year living together, but our first year living together without housemates. For context: 

- We will most likely have a small yard, 3 bedroom house that we are renting (rental laws here say that you can keep a pet as long as it's reasonable eg. No Dane in a studio apartment, etc) 

- We are pretty sold on getting a German Spitz (Mittel) from a Registered breeder 

- We are planning on crate training, and setting up a 'puppy apartment for when we are gone (max 4 hours at a time and not in the first few months) 

- We have money put aside for maintenance of our future pup, including for a complete care membership for a vet/petstore which will give us unlimited vet visits, yearly dental care, free vaccines, and free puppy school. As well as discounts on grooming and premium foods

- We have a training plan, and we are firm on only using positive methods. 

Some more context: 

- We are both students (I know, huge alarm) but we don't do most things that students do. 

- We don't drink

- Social outings are at friends houses or at ours are very calm, and pet friendly (think movie and pizza nights, D&amp;D)

- We have good friends who are great dog parents and it'd give us a great excuse to hang out even more 

- I have experience in helping in shelters with training and socialisation, my partner recently fully trained his brother's dog, so we know what we're getting into 

- I am planning on getting my Cert III in dogtraining

-We are financially stable 

We have done hours of research on training methods, people experiences training and owning Spitzs, requirements from what type of grooming brush to use, to what is an ideal diet for their coat, health and wellbeing. 
Are we going to be prepared?

My next issue is that a couple of our non-dog parent friends are staunchly #ADOPTDONTSHOP thinking that reputable breeders are doing the same damage as BYB. We've been given a few choice words by them, disregarding the fact that there was a lot of thought put into our decision, including that the shelters around us are full of large dogs (not good for our space) and medium bully breeds (I love them, but will not be equipped for them). I am also hoping to train my dog to help me with teaching puppy school when I get my cert. This requires a dog that has a predictable temperament. We are also not equipped to deal with the behavioral rehabilitation that may be required of a shelter dog. They just don't seem to be listening. How do I explain to them that this is my partner's and my decision that we made not because we want a 'designer dog' and status, but because we're being realistic about what we can handle?"	dogs

1345	[Help] Dog's favorite toy seems to cause him anxiety	My dog, Squirt, destroys stuffed toys extremely quickly, but it isn't much of an issue since the local pet store sells 2 small ones for 5 dollars. I usually buy two of these every few weeks to gives him. One day before heading out in the morning I gave him a plastic green bone that I fully expected to come home to destroyed, however, oddly it was completely intact when I got home. Half a year later he STILL hasn't torn it up and often puts it next to him when he sleeps and sometimes just presses his nose down on it to hear the squeaky sound, so I figure it's his favorite toy. However the problem is every once in awhile he'll pick it up and start pacing around the house with it and whining. Though he doesn't seem to want to play if I try taking it nor does there seem to be anything specific that starts these little episodes. So I was wondering if anyone might know why he does this?	dogs

Anyways we go to a park, it's not even a park it's a patch of unused forest, behind their homes. So, dogs and or people can do whatever but there isn't much people who go there. there is a sign that dogs must be leashed, so that's what my neighbor and I do. We leash our dogs and play fetch with a 50ft leash connected to our dogs. 

This person, keeps coming by with her big horse sized Great Dane I think it  and chucking her ball at my dog, who hates dogs, purposely trying to get her dog to come closer to mine when I told her not to. Her dog is off leash while ours is on leash following the sign rules which makes my dog nervous and snappy because her dog will charge him. 

I told her dog needs to be leashed blah blah blah, and in revenge the next day the leash was cut up in pieces. I can't make assumptions who did it, cause I didn't see her do it, but, come on obviously it was her because I told her off, she's been doing it for awhile tho.

Soooo I need help, what can my neighbor and I do? Is there any like super long leash a dog can play fetch on, but.. Cannot be cut or broken and can hold massive muscular dogs who are 90 pounds rather than a nylon that can be skipped with ease?

1347	[Discussion] What’s your dog’s daily exercise routine? And does my schedule look enough?	"I’m starting to wonder if I’m perhaps not exercising my dog enough and I want to know what other owner’s routines are to compare so I can reevaluate mine and adjust accordingly. No behaviour changes or problems to note, I guess I’ve just been spending a lot of time combing through this subreddit and as this is my first dog I’m raising, I just want to be sure I’m doing it right and being the best owner I can be. 

Dog info: 3 y/o rescue Canaan/Shepherd (more than likely a super mutt). She’s very calm but can be  skittish or nervous around new people/dogs. She doesn’t really play with toys and isn’t interested in balls, kongs, frisbees, or puzzles. She’s a healthy weight according to the vet. 

Mon- Friday:
- 1x daily walk, approx 3-5 km 
- 2x week, full day daycare ~ 8/10 hours 
- 1x daily training sessions in a big field, off leash or longline for about 20 minuets in the middle of our walks

Sat-Sun:
- 1 x weekend hike, anywhere from 8 to 20 km (Feb to Oct only) 
- 1x daily walks, approx 3k (on non-hike day)
- 1x daily training (same as above) 

Do you think she’s getting enough exercise? I’m mainly concerned about the daily walks. She’s only getting one walk a day when most dogs I think get 2-3 walks a day. When we first got her she had a morning and afternoon walk (dog walker) each up to 30 minuets but she was refusing to go out in the mornings (around 5:30 am) I don’t know if she’s just lazy or if I wasn’t being forceful enough but she hates morning walks. When I could get her up and going she’d sit at the end of the street and refuse to go further. We canceled the dog walker because she was having similar problems.

1348	[Fluff] Thanks to doggy owners that encourage others!	"I have a 4 month old golden retriever. We live in the city and have amazing large parks (and a river!) practically on our doorstep. My city truly is like a giant dog park. To see a dog on a leash is actually in the minority here vs. free range.  

I've been working on recall a lot with my pup. We spend loads of time in the middle of the field (cyclists are an attraction) and I love that other dog owners have been very free with advice as well as help. Yesterday, a standard poodle owner (gorgeous pup!) was patiently helping me with my pup staying while she walked away with hers -- this is really, really tricky for my pup still.

Also, when I apologize for xyz that my dog did, people are so great at saying ""She's just a baby, she'll get it"" or ""you're doing great with ___"". They'll offer tips, tricks, etc.

1349	[Help] Any advice for a first time (Border Collie) dog owner?	"Hi guys! 
So me and my boyfriend have been taking care of Bennie for about 2.5 months now. He was a surprise dog; I went camping with a friend, and a stray dog with no collar or chip wouldn't leave our site. I couldn't leave him there, and no one came looking for him, so I took him home.

He's about four or five according to vets. Doesn't have any major health problems thankfully! But we're using Bag Balm to get rid of some pretty nasty hyperkeratosis on his paws.

I didn't know he was part of the smartest breed until after I took him home, but he's honestly a weird one and doesn't really live up to his reputation. He's smart but not very energetic at all. He'll sniff dogs at the park but he doesn't know how to play with them. He's not neutered yet, so I'm wondering if once that's done he'll be less of an introvert. We give him a lot of attention and take him on decent walks, but he gets tired easily (not sure if it's because of his paws).

He's not super affectionate but he does like to be pet by us. However when we try and get him to jump on our bed to cuddle, he looks away from us. He seems not to want to intrude or something. Don't know anything about his history; there were some sheep and horse ranches around where I found him, so vets think he may have been a ranch dog. But considering his activity level and disinterest with other animals in general, I feel like that's not the case.

1350	Now I'm scared? Are dogs really wolves? [Discussion]	"Is that why they hate me? Dogs generally don't like me I've had close calls dogs who try to knock the fence down to kill me and the like. And three dogs I owned have bitten me and they were all dogs under 25 lbs. The large ones can't stand me. I thought they were canos familiaris. I just looked today both dogs and dongoes are the same thing as wolves? C. lupus? I got a dog three weeks ago because of overcrowding with the shelters I tried to help out I'm so glad I didn't get the big pit bull that I wanted I'd be so scared of my home right now. Still pretty freaked out right now because I don't get how is it safe to have a wolf? Even if it is a Chihuahua. I remember reading about a 12 inch wolf in Japan that had to be made extinct because they all had rabies. I mean if a 12 inch wolf is dangerous then what kind of wolf isn't dangerous? Did scientist try to lie to people about the dog being a wolf because of the marketting? I mean for the breeder's sake? He's the link their species is wolves just like dingoes!

1352	[Help] 4 poops during walk. Normal?	"I took my dog for a walk tonight. We would run for about a minute and then walk for about 3 while doing some training. He poo’d twice which didnt raise any concerns to me, as he sometimes does this.

But then later on a third and then a fourt time. So we stopped doing the run then walk thing and I gave him a rest befofe just walking back home.

We went out at 7pm and he hadnt eaten since 10am (fed once we got home-late dinner) but he did have a few training treats especially on the walk (loose leash training)

He didnt seem out of it and ate his treats with no issues...but should I be concerned about him stopping **4** times to poo?"	dogs

1355	[Help] My female senior dog has gotten very humpy lately and idk why	"I have a 12 year old female beagle. I rescued her in april 2017 and my husband and I have worked super hard on rehabbing her of all kinds of issues. Recently though, whenever she gets super excited she will get very humpy. She will start licking my arm or leg or whatever and then start clawing at me and trying to mount. I always push her off, and immediately boot her off the bed/couch until she calms down. I also try to redirect her to a toy instead since it seems to be an energy thing. The toy redirecting does help, but often she will end up dropping the toy after a couple throws and trying to do the same problem behavior. I just wanted to know if anyone else had any other solutions. 

Also I want to note, I havent been able to take her on a lot of long walks bc the heat where I am is insane and it's just not safe for her to be out longer than neccessary. I know this could be a contributing factor to the problem behavior, but until it cools down I need some kind of solution. "	dogs
1356	[Help] Making the hard decision to let my dog go	"My wife and I have been having a hard time making this decision and I was hoping other peoples more objective opinions could help us. We recgonize our own bias and are so torn.
My dog PupPup(yes a super lazy name)is an 11 year old terrier mix that has congenital heart failure with a significantly enlarged heart that pushes on his trachea which only worsens his collapsing trachea and collapsing bronchia issues. We have him on various heart medicines as well as couph suppressant.
He has always been a lazy dog so its hard to notice how hes doing or feeling. Overall he seems to have become more lethargic and cant really go for extended walks anymore because he cant breath after a while and starts making a gasping sound with an goose honk cough. He also seems to be restless at night and often lays on the tile to try and cool down. We will hear him at night trying to get air as well as different parts of the day but its everyday at this point .
Other times he seems totally normal and eats food and water and will chase his tail and play, but his breathing seems to be getting progressivley worse and I'm concerned hes just suffering needlessly since his issues dont have a cure. 
Our biggest concern is we know hes going to succumb to his illnesses eventually but that could be who knows how long. Is it better to ease his passing now or do we wait until we somehow 100% know it is time. If we choose the latter it feels like we made him suffer so we wouldnt feel guilty and that is equally painful to us.

I'm just looking for peoples thoughts.

1362	[help] How to keep dog occupied while working from home?	"I have a 9 year old standard sized, long-haired dachshund. We rescued her when she was a year old. That entire time, my husband and I have both always worked full-time jobs, so she is left at home for a majority of the day, and given copious amounts of attention when we get home.

For the last few months, my husband and I have been working from home a day or two a week, because our jobs allow us to do so. The problem we both have with her: she sits at our feet and cries. And whines. And cries. And jumps. And whines. She will do this for HOURS until we give her attention in the form of picking her up to sit in your lap, play with one of her toys, or getting up to get her a treat from the kitchen. Once you put her back on the floor, walk away from the game, or she finishes her treat, she goes right back to doing the same thing. Over and over and over.

I fully understand that this is a result of rewarding bad behavior over the years (mostly due to feeling so guilty for being at work all day). But now that we're both staying home (not at the same time), she's driving us both insane. My husband has a worse time with it, because she does that while he's on conference calls.

​

So I'm coming to r/dogs and asking my fellow owners, what can we do to keep her busy while I'm working?? You'd think she would want to sleep, but instead she has the crazy energy of a puppy that no amount of pre-work walking can flush out.

"I'd like to be able to give my dog bones and chews-- they keep her occupied and I know she enjoys them. She comes from a very food-insecure background, however; raised in an abusive environment, then found later on the streets near starvation. 

I know that competitive/unusually fast eating comes from this type of environment. It really poses a danger when I try to give her anything to chew on, however. She's a shih-tzu, so she's quite small, and I am very conscious of the potential for choking or intestinal blockage.

Does anyone have any advice as to things I can do to circumvent this issue? Or would it be better for me to continue to refrain from giving her anything?

1368	[Discussion] dog breed, size, color: effect on strangers or intruders	"\*I'm curious if there are statistics or studies that show which dog breeds or types (if any) are most ""threatening"" to strangers on a walk or a home intrusion. Linking those would be wonderful! I also welcome personal anecdotes if you care to share them.

​

First, I'd like to clarify that I'm not looking for a dog that is actually aggressive. I have no intention of getting an attack or guard dog. I would love an alarm dog (my understand is most dogs are good alarm dogs) and be especially drawn to a breed that would bark its head off should an intruder ever come into my house. So a dog that is aloof with strangers but *not* human aggressive would be great for me.

​

You're also probably wondering why I am sounding so damn paranoid about an intruder or being attacked on a walk. I do have PTSD and now that I live alone, I get so fearful at nighttime that I can barely sleep. I also get fearful going on hikes since the trails are often secluded. I am going to therapy for this issue, but I think what would help me feel the safest is to get a dog that might ""ward off"" strangers. I currently have a small dog and her companionship has helped me tremendously. That said, she is very small and she doesn't make me feel any safer at home or on walks largely due to the stigma surrounding small dogs--people run up to her all the time, sometimes even pick her up and pet her without asking. I feel that wouldn't happen so often with a breed such as a german shepherd.

​

This brings me to my dilemma. I love herding breeds, specifically GSDS and belgian shepherds. I especially adore dobermans and beaucerons (if I could choose just one dog to have for the rest of my life, it would probably be a beauceron) . The problem is that all these dogs tend toward DA or SSA. Beaucerons in the US also tend toward HA. I don't need a ""dog park"" dog, but I would like to eventually have 3...or 4...or 5 dogs lol. So it is important to me that I get a dog that will enjoy living with several other dogs.

​

This leads me to think that I need to stick with sporting breeds and sighthounds. But those of you with experience with herding breeds, please let me know if you think any of them would be a possibility in my situation. I think a poodle could be a great option for me--I'm told they're rather velcro, biddable (I will do sports with the dog), expressive, and athletic. My concern is the stigma other people have for poodles. Would a poodle not intimidate an intruder or potentially ward off an attacker while on a hike? Again, I mean by appearance alone and do not mean for the dog to actually engage an attacker. I'm thinking a black poodle, shaved close all over, might be the most intimidating. But what if I ended up with a red poodle and wanted a [haircut like this where the body is shaved close but the ears are longer?](https://trainthatpooch.com/the-majestic-poodle/). I'm also interested in vizslas (not aloof with strangers but still might be intimidating?), GSPs (potential DA?), dalmatians (DA?), whippets (not intimidating looking)

​

I know, I know, ""any dog is a deterrent"". But my friend has a small dog and her house was still robbed while she was sleeping. The dog was barking at the intruder and they just ignored it. I truly feel a larger dog of a different breed would be more intimidating. Thank you for reading this ridiculously long post and I hope I don't sound too crazy. As for my lifestyle: I will be doing a lot of training and exercise with whatever breed I get. I currently walk/run on trails for about 5 miles a day. With a larger dog I would also like to start biking.

**​**

**TL;DR: Are there any statistics showing which dog breeds or types are most intimidating to strangers or intruders; also open to personal anecdotes. Dog needs to be relatively healthy breed and able to live in a house with other dogs. I am very interested in poodles but I worry they would not make me feel any safe than my small dog just due to the way some people perceive them**

1369	[Help]Walks	So put bluntly I need help with info on how and when I should walk my dog. My dog is a husky/cocker spaniel mix, around 8-9 years so she’s pretty old, and she’s also pretty fat because she rarely goes outside except for bathroom. She also runs near full speed whenever she goes out for walks if thats important info. Because I now have time on my hands and because I’m the only one in my household physically able to take her for walks, I’m determined to make it a part of my routine. However the issue is I know little on what to do. How often and how long? She likes to run almost the entire time, so should i encourage this or make her walk? Any patterns or tips for just starting out? I know its a shame that she didn’t get her daily walks prior to this but I want to change that, any help is appreciated.	dogs
1370	[Fluff] Hiding treats and ratting	"We have 5 border terriers. Every morning and night after they eat breakfast and dinner, we hide treats all over the yard -- along the fence, around the patio, under and on the patio furniture, around shrubs. We get 10 treats and break them up and hide those pieces. 

When we start to let them out, we get them to the door and all excited (barking, turning, scratching at the door) and as soon as we open the door, they fly out. They all scatter different directions, noses to the ground, looking for the treats. They usually find almost all of them, and have learned over time to get really good at this. 

My dad also has a barn that has a major rodent issue. He let's our 3 cats in the barn while he's working, and the cats catch mice &amp; rats and flush them out while the dogs catch the runners, and then we freeze them and feed them to the snakes. "	dogs
1371	[Breeds] 1 year out speculation	"**Introduction**

Teensy bit of context: I've been mentally/emotionally ready for a dog for two years now, since I finished undergrad. But I'm just about to move from the US to the UK for a 1 year graduate program. I do not plan on getting the dog until the program is done, I'm just excited and anticipating. Depending on employment status, I may remain in the UK and get a dog there, or I may move back to the US and get a dog here.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, but for the last year I've been primary caretaker for my parents' 11 yr old labradoodle, for 2.5 years I worked at a dog daycare and volunteered at the city shelter, and for 4 years I've been a dogsitter. I also interned with a dog trainer doing puppy classes.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* First dog, probably rescue because I'm ready for a dog and know that purchasing from a breeder can take months to years. I'm also not sure I'm ready for puppyhood.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Young, energetic, comes with or easy to train an off switch, cuddly, handler engaged, smart/innovative (yes I know...). A dog who will encourage me to go run in the morning and then sack out on the couch. Dream right now is a border collie (if in the UK) or an aussie (if in the US). Both are readily available in rescues in those locations and have the get-up-and-go I'm looking for. But those are both a lot of dog.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I LOVE herding dogs. I love their focus and drive and the problem solving attitude they bring to everything (even if there isn't actually a problem to solve). I'm also a big fan of terriers. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Probably start in rally-o but I'd love to do agility and/or obedience. In the future I'm interested in bitework and herding but those take more time and money than I think I'll have in a year. This in addition to standard obedience and any tricks I can think up. As above, I'd like the dog to run with me so good leash manners will be a priority.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 30-90 minute run (depending on where I'm at in my plan) plus 1+ hour walk, plus 2-4 (depending on where the dog's at) 5-10 minute training sessions. If (as is likely) I'm in an apartment, as many potty breaks as needed, and meals will almost certainly be done in a puzzle toy. So total, minimum of 1 hr 45 minutes of one-on-one interaction every day. Usually at least 2 hours.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I already go for a 1 hour walk a day and additionally a half hour run every other day, both of which the dog will be welcome on (once manners and joints are up to par for the run). Also a weekly dog sport. I have had good luck historically with dog parks but if the dog's not interested, that's fine too. On weekends when the weather is good, I go for hikes.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm open to hair trims and ear cleaning at home. I'm also willing to go to a groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium! Most apartments here have a weight limit around 50-60 lbs. I don't know about the UK but some time in the dog's lifespan we'll be back in the US. I'm not a big fan of tiny dogs, so at least 10 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is no big deal. Excessive barking is not my favorite thing, but I don't mind warning barks or quiet grumbles. Not a big fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Nifty if we can do it, no big deal if we can't.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggles! My parents' dog likes personal space and I really want someone to cuddle with.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* ... both? I want a handler-focused problem-solving dog. So more on the eager-to-please, but not to the point of stupidity.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A few barks and then a controlled greeting. I don't want a stranger-aggressive dog, but I can manage and train either excessive greeting or fear. I would like a dog who warns me of approach. On walks, ignoring strangers would be excellent.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Separation anxiety. My parents' dog has it, and it really makes it hard for me, as an anxious person, to leave her alone without feeling guilty. I don't want to feel guilty! I know that a lot of handler-attached dogs are SA prone and I'm willing to do some work initially, but as a rule, no big hysterics when I leave.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This is the mystery. I'm not going into a field with a lot of standard 40 hour work weeks, but I just don't know.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* When I get the dog it'll be just me. Eventually I'll move in with my girlfriend, and she also likes smart active dogs. She'll be the backup but I'll be the primary caretaker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Girlfriend is going to be getting a cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* As a rule, US apartments don't like bully breed mixes, GSDs, or other stereotypically dangerous breeds. I've also found they tend to have weight limits around 60 lbs.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Next year, Edinburgh UK and yes, no pits. After that, Tampa Florida, and not to my knowledge.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In Edinburgh it'll be about 15 C (60 F) in the summer and 4 C (40 F) in the winter. In Tampa, 85 F (27 C) in the summer and 65 F (18 C) in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I know I have a big life change coming up. I'm willing to wait until I return to the states to get a dog. I also know things will shift based on my rental status and employment. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether the breeds I'm interested in would be a good fit for me--and what others might work too.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

* It feels like I'm always one year away from being in the perfect place to get a dog. Does this ever get better or do I just need to say screw it and get the dog?"	dogs

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* At the moment I think I prefer the idea of going through a breeder, however I'm not opposed to rescuing or adopting from a shelter, I just find it to be more difficult. In my area the majority in shelters and rescues are pit bulls, which I adore, but sadly the majority of homes in my area will not allow the breed.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My only real set in stone idea is a female medium/large breed. I love the look of a merle Australian Shepherd, and I will always be a sucker for blue eyes, of course neither of these are requirements for me. I also would like something with the same fur length as an aussie.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* As I stated above, I have been highly interested in Aussies, but the activity level is what worries me.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Of course, I plan to train basic commands such as sit, roll over, lay down, etc. I would also like to teach more advanced things like how to put away toys or jumping through hoops and stuff, I do plan on taking classes to help.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I am a college student and a part time waitress. I work Saturday-Monday with a maximum shift of 5 hours. I have school Monday-Wednesday for a maximum of 2 and a half hours. In future semesters I still plan on spreading out my classes enough to spend time with pup in between. I will be walking before and after work and classes.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I plan on walking 2 or 3 times a day. Around my neighborhood. The closest dog park is about an hour away so I could make that work once a week along with the occasional hiking trail.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am more than open to fully grooming myself, well, I would need to learn how to properly do ears as that is something that would worry me. I do not mind going to the occasional groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I would like a medium/large sized dog. Nothing smaller than an Aussie, nothing near the size as a Great Dane.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding and I can deal with barking, however I would prefer a dog that does not slobber/drool obsessive. I understand it as an occasional thing but I can't deal with constant drool lol

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This isn't something important to me. I worry about animals running in the road so I would always have mine leashed in my area. My boyfriend lives more in the country so as long as my dog is properly trained to be off leash and come when called I could deal with being off leash there. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm a sucker for snuggles. My dog doesn't have to be under my feet 24/7, though I wouldn't mind if they were. But I would like a dog that wouldn't mind cuddling with me at night.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I'm not sure how to answer this one either. I don't mind my dog doing whatever (as long as it's not destructive) when I am doing something around the house or homework or something, but I would like for them to be responsive and cooperative when asked to do something like sitting or coming when called.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind barking when someone knocks or enters my yard, as I know it can actually keep burglars at bay at times. I do want my dog to be friendly towards others and show no aggression. I know this will require socialization on my part.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would prefer my dog not be aggressive towards other dogs. I know this will also require socialization on my part. Once I graduate college and get my own place I'm sure I would get more dogs and possibly a cat as my boyfriend is a cat person. I'm studying veterinary so I'm sure I'd come home with animals in that profession lol.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing else that I can think of.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* As I stated before, no longer than 2.5 hours at a time on the days I have school and no longer than 5 when I have to work. I do plan on taking a week off the week that I get a pup.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* None of my other family members really care too much, it's just my mother and two younger siblings. My siblings would surely love to play with it and I could help teach them a little of responsibility by letting them help me care for it. I would like to think my mom would help with walks if I can't but I can't count on her for that. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I would like to have more pets in the future, but that will be a while from now. My cousins have a mix breed and a chihuahua we would do play dates with though.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I have a 7 and 8 (almost 8 and 9) year old brother and sister but they are the youngest in my family.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent at the moment and will probably rent for the next couple of years. As far as I know my current place has no restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live a little south of Atlanta, Georgia. As far as I know there are no breed banning laws. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* It can get up to the 90s in the summer (Fahrenheit) and usually in the 40s in winter, but it will occasionally go into the 30s.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* There isn't anything else I can think of but I will answer any additional questions in the comments. Thanks!

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  "	dogs

Some of you might’ve seen my post a few days/weeks ago about this, but now it has a part two. This disgusts me. This is animal abuse, and people are too ignorant to see that and it got so popular to warrant a sequel. It sickens me that people can’t see how abusive and unhealthy these corgis’ lives are. Assuming this is how they always are with each other, this is torturous to them. I don’t get how someone can think this is cute or funny. Would they also think someone punching their dog and the dog yelping is cute and funny? How revolting. And to add insult to injury... now I’m no health expert, so I could be wrong, but those dogs look *heavily* overweight. Very unhealthy. I feel so bad for the dogs, their lives are awful because of their awful owners. And everyone thinks it’s cute. It makes me angry. But the owners don’t care, because free YouTube views right! "	dogs
1376	[discussion] leads are dangerous	"There’s been a lot of debate in my house over which of my dog’s retractable lead is the 8m one so this evening me and my brother decided to perform a very scientific test and pull them both to full length and see. I was correct and the one I thought was 8m (not relevant to the story but I was right!!). 

My brother had the end with the clips on and I thought it’d be funny to see how the dog reacted if we let them reel in by letting go (she finds the hose hilarious when we reel it in and likes to chase it round, I assumed the reaction would be the same) so he let the first one go and all was well, dog found it amazing, we had a laugh. Onto the second one. 
This went significantly worse and, long story short, my elbow is 3x the size and black with the imprint of the metal clip in it... and that ladies and gentlemen is the story I now have to tell the doctors and nurses at a&amp;e when they ask while I wait to find out if my elbow is broken, because I played about with the dog lead.

My Springer Spaniel, my best bud in the whole entire world, has been having sinus issues for the past year and a half. She would do this reverse sneeze at random for several minutes, sometimes multiply times a day. The vet said it is chronic sinusitis after several office visits, an x ray, anti biotics, and steroids. 

She is currently on Peroxicam that she takes one pill daily. That has kept it at bay fairly well as she rarely does the reverse sneeze anymore. However, you can tell she is still congested. 

Has anyone run into this before? Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I know shes ""getting up there"" but this dog got me through a serious bout of depression in college. If it weren't for her I wouldn't of graduated and probably wouldn't be around anymore.

1379	[Help] My 8-month old doodle keeps regurgitating water.	"Hey, looking for any help I can get here.

I have an 8 month old goldendoodle. As the title says, he keeps regurgitating JUST his water after he finishes drinking. Sometimes it's a couple minutes after drinking, other times it's 30 min later. The only time any food comes up, it's just small pieces if he ate and drank in the same sitting.

He isn't vomiting. We dealt with that before and there are no violent hiccups or anything. Just a very quick regurgitation of a bit of water. And it's not ALL of the water, just some of what he drank.

I also don't see much bile along with it.  No yellow bubbles or anything. Seems to just be water and maybe some saliva. 

I think it's because he may be drinking too fast but even when I give him just a little bit of water, he will still sometimes regurgitate that, just obviously less. He also is not noticeably less energetic either.

1383	Which breed for young family? [Breeds], [Help]	" 

We are looking at getting our 1st dog (both my husband and I had family dogs as children but not as adults) and would love to get some advice on which direction to start looking into!

Our 5 year old son has just been assessed as being a 'high emotional needs child' so thats definitely a factor but we were talking about it abit before that too. We have an 8 year old also.

I'm home most of the day, most days (while my husband travels for work often so is away alot), so I would love an affectionate buddy to have around (although obviously Im not home 24/7 so dont want a dog that will destroy the house if its left alone more than afew hours on occasion). I'd likely do 1-2 walks on weekdays and on the weekends we like to do a decent walk in the bush/at the beach etc as a family.

We have 2 cats which we've had for years. Our house has a big backyard and is fully fenced.

Would prefer one that doesnt have any intense grooming needs. 

So overall - a good family dog - very affectionate and cuddly but also keen to play with the kids and get out for some walks with me. Happy with loads of time around people but also wont wreck the house/backyard if its alone for an afternoon..

So excited to hear what you think!"	dogs
1384	[Help] How do you keep from being discouraged when training a rescue dog and there is little progress?	"Stella is a really well trained rescue dog. I have only had her for 3 months. She knows sit, stay, down, jump, speak, shake. She doesn't counter surf, drink from the toilet and only dumpster dives when nobody is home. She walks with a loose leash until she sees another dog... then she goes into full on puppy-mode, jumping and pulling and barking and circling. But she is not a puppy; she's a 90lbs Labradane and has over 300lbs of pulling force. 

We started with a prong collar per her rescue recommendation, but it cut up her neck due to missing hair (allergies). So we have been using a martingale instead. Every time we see a dog, I make sure she has seen it for a second, then I get her attention back on me and treat her. Right now we can get within 100ft of another dog before I nearly dislocate my shoulder. 

It's just so discouraging to have major slip-ups, like last week when I didn't see a puppy until we were at the top of a hill and Stella dragged me to the bottom of the hill. Today it was dark and I didn't see the dog until 30ft away. The other Lab just walked right past us like we weren't even there, meanwhile Stella is doing the mambo on the leash.

I don't have access to a training facility right now (and the thought of bringing her to a building full of dogs terrifies me). How do you not want to quit and become a hermit with your dog?

1390	[help] training methods info	"

Hi guys. So in the future I want to someday get a dog. (Definitely not in the near future) but i always like researching dog training methods and have become a bit confused and lost now. I’m getting two very different methods. There is the positive reinforcement method and a dominance or “natural” method.

 they seem to be at odds with each other.  I have recently found a dog trainer that suggests the more gruff and dominant training style. I personally have always sided with positive reinforcement but the dogs she has trained seem totally fine and socially with people and other dogs, great even. They seem well behaved and obedient. How is that achievable?  

It really confuses me because when i looked into dominance training usually the outcome is a scared dog scared of its owner. Yet its not the case? They have put up quite a few video showing their dogs behavior and how they train them. I wanted to know though if her methods are a good idea. Show you mix methods? Should i just stick to positive reinforcement? 

Heres an example of her training: 

(Socializing with unfamiliar animals)
https://youtu.be/vg0C34V4xZU
You could watch the whole video but 2:14 is a good start to see what the training method is like. 

(Dog park interactions)
https://youtu.be/JZwqo5Sqo8A
At 0:48 is a good start just to show how her dogs act with other dogs

(Dog disciplining)
https://youtu.be/1mBz9OFujyE
5:20

My goal with this post is to have a conversation about the two methods and why and how they are effective. I really want to believe that positive reinforcement is the way to go but seeing her dogs act so nice seems odd to me. It makes me think maybe thats also a good training method.  


Thanks guys! "	dogs
1391	[Help] I rescued a Dachshund who was/is overweight.	"Tl;Dr: my rescue dog was extremely overweight when I got him. Is there any advice anyone could give to help him lose weight?

Hello there! Around 3 years ago I received a Dachshund named Harley from my extended family. At the time when he arrived he was ~39lbs. Extremely overweight. Could only walk for short distances and it broke my heart to see him in such a condition. I learned that his previous owners had fed him not just scraps, but entire meals fit for human consumption, and tons of fast food.

I don't have any pictures of him on hand when he was that large but believe me when I say he used to look like the Dachshund from this video

https://youtu.be/qqofYX7vK-s

His current pictures: 
https://imgur.com/a/KPcysGg

After 3 years he's come down a lot on his weight near half, we're about to go for an annual checkup and I'll know his actual weight then. He's able to run now and even plays with our Chihuahua. However him losing has been stagnant for a while. We took him off human food when we got him and  he's been on small dog breed food. He gets fed twice daily, but likes to sneak to the big dogs bowl and grab a few bites. I'm writing now to hopefully get some advice from y'all. I'm going today to buy a small pool for him to practice water exercises, and I plan for more trips to the local dog park when my work and school schedule frees up. 

Is there any sort of meal plan that would help him get to a more ideal normal weight for Dachshunds?

Any specific exercises to help his movement and breathing without over exerting him? 

Lastly is there any sites anyone could link me to for more information about on dog weight loss?

Thank you.

1395	[Help] What options do I have for a rescue w/ awful separation anxiety that barks when I arrive?	" 

Sorry for yet another MY DOG BARKS TOO MUCH post, but I'm really out of ideas. I absolutely DO NOT want to put a basket muzzle on my dog, but I don't know what else to do.

Quick background: my dog is a 6-yr old Chihuahua-Jack Russel mix. I rescued him from a shelter who had him for a few years because nobody would adopt him. He was abused as a puppy and skittish of everything and has AWFUL separation anxiety.

He's crated with my other chihuahua mix for 10 hours during the work day (split into 5 hour parts, thanks to dog walkers). Whenever someone comes home, either when the dog walker picks him up or when I get home from work, he barks incessantly from the second he hears the front door knob turn until someone tells him to be quiet. The crate is in the living room so it takes about 20 seconds or so until I'm able to quiet him down. I can only imagine what the neighbors think during those 20 seconds (especially if I'm out at night and it happens at 1-2 AM).

Ignore him when he starts barking, then shower him with affection once he quiets? Tried it, he just kept barking and barking. Eventually my other dog started barking too.

Exercise him more? I take him for a 30 minute walk before I leave for work (around 8:30a), and he gets another 30-45 minute walk with the dog walker (around 1:30p). Doesn't help.

Leave toys in the crate? This dog can care less about toys, even if they're stuffed with delicious treats.

Work on his separation anxiety? I took one month off from work to work with a dog behaviorist and help his separation anxiety, that's $1000 I flushed down the drain.

I'm on the verge of letting this dog go, but I really don't want to. The barking isn't the only reason, but it certainly doesn't help. If I surrender this dog, nobody will ever adopt him again, and I don't want him to die.

I can't bring myself to put a basket muzzle on him - especially since he's already in a crate. But I'm at a loss here, I've tried so many things and nothing helps."	dogs

1397	[help] doggie nightmare fixes?	"So about 4 months ago my husband and I adopted a pittie mix, female, spayed, 2 years old. We don’t know much about her history, except that she’s been in various shelters for the majority of her life. She’s very sweet, sassy and has begun opening up to us a lot more. Love her to bits. 

She has some idiosyncrasies, like she does not like being touched in her abdominal or back leg area by your feet, especially when you have food. So I assume she was kicked badly multiple times, though she doesn’t have any injuries from this. She doesn’t bite, just barks and backs away. Similarly, she hates black dogs, possibly because her kennel mate was a black dog who had left a lot of bite marks on her when we adopted her (a while other story).

She’s generally a good sleeper at night, and her bed is next to ours. (Yes, we tried a crate, she wouldn’t even enter the room even for fave treats and cried when we tried to coax her; we decided it wasn’t worth her emotional anguish, please don’t lecture on that) Like most dogs she dreams and while usually they’re nice dreams where she’s relaxed and just making cute whooping sounds, sometimes she gets growly or worse. 

This has happened twice now: she bolts up into a run from a dead sleep. The first time she was pointed longways in the room and ran and barked for a couple feet before waking up. Last night, she bolted up and straight into the mirrored closet door. Aside from having the ever loving shit scared out of us, nothing was damaged and she was fine, but shaken up. Soothed her and she went back to sleep. But is there something we can do to try and cut down on this? I don’t want broken mirrors or dented walls, which is a real possibility since she’s 50 lbs of pure spooked pupper. I don’t really want to put her on anti-anxiety meds as she’s normally very calm and doesn’t have other anxiety issues. Is this just a matter of waiting it out and letting her issues get forgotten, or???

(Also, we’ve tried moving her bed to the more open area of the bedroom, but she’ll wait till we’re asleep and drag it right next to my side of the bed. So placement change is difficult lol)"	dogs
