"Context: “Yeah, I’ve always gotten the sense he’d give Boston a long term shot. I’ve heard, I think we all have, the talk about him in New York and these different situations. I just think it’s normal now… I’m sure we’ll start hearing it with Kevin Durant too depending on how the Golden State Warriors season goes because these players they’re in the last years of their contracts, teams are hoping to contend and if you’re not meeting expectations and the goals then there’s gonna be eyeballs. I think Boston relishes that challenge. I think they know eyes are going to be on them, on Kyrie, and that’s just another storyline I think to watch all year. But I’ve also gotten the sense… listen, he’s happy, he wants his own team and he got that in Boston, he has a stacked team, he’s close to Jayson Tatum, it’s a good market that he’s playing in, and I haven’t gotten the sense that Kyrie Irving is the type that’s going to going to be bolting from franchise to franchise.

20	I just watched the WNBA for the first time and I’ve gotta say	"I just watched the WNBA for the first time and I’ve gotta say IM A FAN!
These girls are legit, and the game is a lot more exciting than I was originally expecting. It seems that the general consensus has been that the WNBA was boring and slow, and lacked the athleticism and exciting plays the NBA has to offer. After watching my first game I couldn’t disagree more. 
After seeing all the news circulating about WNBA players complaining about low compensation, I decided to give the game a chance. I’m a Seattle native and was aware that the storm were playing the mercury for a winner take all game 5, and decided to tune in.
This game ended up being one of the more exciting games I’ve seen all year, including the NBA and college basketball. Sue bird absolutely took over the 4th quarter and looked unconscious draining three after three from all over the court. The game didn’t lack any excitement, and I’ve gotta say, these women know how to play basketball. Their ball movement and understanding of the game is on par with some of the better teams in the NBA. The only knock I could see was the lack of athleticism (dunks), but that didn’t bother me since the game was such a close match and had clutch performances by players on both teams. 
After today I’ll definitely be tuning in to the WNBA finals to root for my storm. You guys should check one of the games out as well, you might end up liking it a lot. If you end up not enjoying it, than at least now you know. Don’t hate on these women though until you’ve actually given their game a chance."	nba

30	Scottie Pippen Refuses to Enter in the final moments of a Playoff Game	On May 13, 1994, the Chicago Bulls were playing the Knicks in Game 3 of the ECSF. The Bulls had dropped the first 2 games of the series and needed a win to stay in the series. With the score tied at 102, and 1.8 seconds left in the game, Phil Jackson drew up a play for rookie Toni Kukoc. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kukoc did manage to drain a [23 foot buzzer beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NSpgbPcxoU) to stun the Knicks, though there wasn't much celebrating by the Bulls players. Cameras even caught a frowning Jackson storming off the court. The Bulls managed to take the series to 7, but Pippen's 20 points and 16 rebounds were not enough, as the Knicks coasted to an 87-77 victory. They would eventually lose to the Houston Rockets in 7 games.	nba

33	Little-Known NBA Story: Jerry West manipulated John Calipari out of drafting Kobe Bryant at 8th overall	"Jerry West: The Life and Legend of a Basketball Icon - pg 379

&gt;First West had to take the huge gamble of trading veteran center Vlade Divac to the Charlotte Hornets for their thirteenth pick in the draft. Then he learned that John Calipari, the coach of the New Jersey Nets, planned to take [Kobe] Bryant with the eighth pick before the Lakers could snare him at thirteen.

&gt;”Jerry wanted Kobe, so he basically called up and talked Cal out of drafting Kobe,” explained Hal Wiseel, who was with the Nets at the time. West encouraged the Bryant family to talk to Calipari and explain that their son really wanted to play for the Lakers. “He knew if we didn’t take him at eight, he’d drop to Charlotte, and he could make the deal with Charlotte,” Wissel recalled. “Cal was young in the league and, hey, it’s Jerry West on the phone.”"	nba
34	Karl Malone is 2nd on the all-time scoring list but never won the scoring title	"He finished runner-up 4 times, each time to Michael Jordan. He scored 31 ppg in 1989-1990, which would have won the scoring title most other years, but was eclipsed by MJ's 33 ppg. MJ has 10 scoring titles but is nonetheless over 4,000 points behind Karl Malone on the all-time list. This is because the Mailman played more seasons than MJ and was still putting up 20 ppg at age 39.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is #1 on the list, only won the scoring title twice, LeBron (#7) has only won it once, and Dirk (#6) has also never won it. Just goes to show that the all-time scoring list rewards consistency and longevity rather than peaks."	nba

##Interesting Trends

 - Overall 32 MVPS from West, 31 from East	

 - 2014-2018	5 years straight where MVP was from the West

 - 2009-2013	5 years straight where MVP was from the East

 - 2002-2008	7 years straight where MVP was from the West

 - 1960-1970	11 years straight where MVP was from East

 - 1978 Artis Gilmore won Eastern Conference MVP despite being just tied for 8th in actual MVP voting. The 7 vote-getters ahead of Gilmore were Walton (winner), Gervin, Thompson, KAJ, Davis, Lucas, Westphal. No other Conference MVP winner placed worse than 5th overall (and only 2 were 5th- 2007 LeBron James and 1969 Elgin Baylor)

##Dominance

 - 1958-1965	6 of 8 for **Russell** in the East	

 - 1956-1961	5 of 6 for **Pettit** in the West	

##Versatility: Players that Won a Conference MVP with Multiple Teams	

 - ^* Shaq	ORL (1995), LAL (2000), 2005 (MIA)

 - LBJ	CLE (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010), MIA (2012-2014), CLE (2015-2018)

 - ^* Moses Malone	HOU (1979, 1982), PHI (1983)

 - KAJ	MIL (1971-1974), LAL (1976, 1977, 1980, 1981)

 - ^* KG 	MIN (2004), BOS (2008)

^* Wilt, Moses Malone, Shaq, and KG are the only ones to win it in each conference (Wilt did it with Philadelphia Warriors and the San Francisco Warriors)

##Longevity: Players with 8+ years between first and last Conference MVPs

 - 9 seasons Wilt (1960-1968)

 - 11 seasons Shaq (1995-2005)

 - 11 seasons KAJ (1970-1981)

 - 12 seasons MJ (1987-1998)

 - 13 seasons LBJ (2006-2018)

*It's interesting that when people talk about their top 5/10 lists, they mention KAJ's longevity, and Shaq's peak, when they both went 11 years between their first and last Conference MVP (though Shaq's three Conference MVPs pale in comparison to KAJ's eight).*

###The Greats: 3+ Conference MVPs

 - 11 LBJ (East)

 - 9 MJ (East)

 - 9 Magic (West)

 - 8 KAJ (West)

 - 6 Russell (East)

 - 5 Wilt (1 West, 4 East)

 - 5 Pettit (West)

 - 4 KD (West)

 - 4 Bird (East)

  - 3 Baylor (West), Kobe (West), Duncan (West), West (West), McAdoo (East), Karl Malone, Moses Malone (2 in West, 1 in East), Shaq (1 in West, 2 in East)

 - Thought it was worth mentioning since he's an all-time great, and the most notable person missing from this list, Hakeem Olajuwon, only has 1 Conference MVP (his historic MVP year in 1994), all other consensus all time top 10 players have at least 3.

###Unlucky: Players that Won a Conference MVP but Never Won an Actual MVP

 - 2004	Jermaine O'Neal (3rd)	

 - 2003	Tracy McGrady (4th)	

 - 2002	Jason Kidd (2nd)	

 - 1999+2000	Alonzo Mourning (2nd+3rd)

 - 1979	Elvin Hayes (3rd)	

 - 1978	Artis Gilmore (T-8th)	

 - 1975	Rick Barry (4th)	

 - 1972	John Havlicek (4th)

41	Ben Simmons &amp; The 76ers: A Threat to a Dynasty	"Taken and reformatted from original post [here](https://theunderhand.com/ben-simmons-threat-dynasty/)

If there's one thing that NBA fans worldwide can (hopefully) agree upon, it's that Ben Simmons' first season in the league was nothing short of fantastic.

After being selected first overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, and further missing that full season due to injury, Simmons debuted this season and dominated, averaging 15.8ppg, 8.1rpg, and 8.2apg. Take into account that he did all this without any semblance of a jumpshot within his game and it continues to impress. Regardless of whether Simmons was a ‘true’ rookie in the season past, he seems destined for a bright future in the NBA.

Simmons was the key playmaker on the young Philadelphia 76ers squad, where he led them to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, finishing with a 52-30 record. This was also their first playoffs appearance in the last 6 years – not bad for a rookie. He excelled running the team’s offense, racking up dimes across the season for a total of 661 – good for 3rd place in the entire NBA. He was comfortable in his game all-around, getting his boards and points to respectable tallies. For a long while, it seemed as though ‘The Process’ was complete.


**Exposure in the Playoffs**

Simmons and the 76ers were, however, exposed in the semi-finals of the playoffs by their newfound Eastern Conference rival – the Boston Celtics. They did what many teams had tried to do all year, and found a way to semi-stifle Ben Simmons’ offensive game with what is possibly the simplest tactic of all time. They gave him space. And when I say they gave him space, I mean they gave him SPACE, which inevitably led to THIS.

https://imgur.com/a/5D1uxuI

I can’t remember a time when any NBA team disrespected a player on defence in such a way since the[ Spurs played Hack-a-Shaq 5 seconds into the 2008 season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_soY5Jg_Q). Even then, that was a joke by Popovich.

[As you can see in ESPN's stats](https://imgur.com/a/TqrBt5h), during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Simmons was held to only 1 point. It's nothing to be entirely worried about, although it's definitely worth noting. This was his first season in the league, and his first true exposure to high-stakes competition, something he didn't reach at LSU. To expect a rookie to have to carry teams with 30+ point performances night-in-night-out shows how much we, as viewers, have become acclimatised to the ability of the likes of LeBron James.

[In this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/97g7ae/oc_worst_playoff_performances_by_notable_rookies/), it's evident that many notable rookies experience similar struggles at some point. Even the Celtics' Tatum had a 4pt game this year; see also, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony circa. 2004.

[Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJdHh9a1Ok) at how Simmons scored his 16 points, though, in Game 3 - immediately following his 1pt performance:

* A mismatch in the post, where he's now 1-on-1 against Rozier (an 8 inch advantage). He goes around him and finishes.
* Goes around Morris who is slow off reading a screen and finishes with a right-hand layup just in front of Horford.
* Finishes around Ojeleye in transition.
* Comes around a screen from Embiid and fakes out Baynes, finishing with an awkward floater/layup on his right.
* Lob on transition from Reddick.
* Hits an exceptionally awkward looking left-handed fadeaway over Horford in the paint.
* Hesitates and pull-ups for a fade in the paint.
* Spins around his defender for a layup.

It's worth noting that Boston didn't give him quite as much space as in Game 2. Compare that to [THIS play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=58&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU) during Game 2.

Horford immediately drops deep and allows Simmons space. Yes, he does get the pass off to Saric who drains the shot - but the principle is right. In fact, if you keep watching the video, you'll see just how effective Boston's tactics were; cutting passing lanes, allowing Simmons space, spying on movement, and doubling down low.

This isn’t to say that it’s a make or break situation for Philly; Ben Simmons, regardless of whether he’s given space or not has shown that he is capable of getting to the rim and finishing – particularly from broken play. He also has phenomenal court vision, and an ability to find any open man as soon as they lace up and step on the court. You see, it's not that Ben Simmons is able to be completely nullified and will never score points again; **it's that Boston managed to find a way that neutralises many of his half-court threats, and this impacts heavily on the structure and flow of the 76ers' offense.**

**The Boston Defence**

Stopping Simmons using the style of defence applied by the Celtics also requires a very versatile, switchable defensive scheme, and an effective set of players – something that few teams in the league have at their disposal. [Boston defends in a very similar manner to Golden State](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/15/boston-celtics-switching-defense-pays-dividends-2018-playoffs) – a heavy usage of switching. When you look at the Celtics squad, they have a group of interchangeable wings that can easily switch assignment without having to face too much of a deficit, plus the access of a premier defender in Marcus Smart. Al Horford is also crucial in this regard, as his pure ability to read the defense and play smart basketball is what gives the Celtics an edge. To top it all off, you have by far one of the best coaches in the league in Brad Stevens, who reads the game unlike many others. Stevens actually said that [he runs a more ‘position-less’ squad](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720250-brad-stevens-says-celtics-have-3-not-5-positions-now), which is what helps the effectiveness of this system. With the use of ‘ball-handlers’, ‘wings’, and ‘bigs’, there is room for interchange.

Here's a look at how the Celtics could line-up this coming season.

First Unit:
* Ball Handler - Kyrie Irving

* Wing - Jaylen Brown

* Wing - Jayson Tatum

* Wing - Gordon Hayward

* Big - Al Horford

Bench unit:
* Ball Handler - Terry Rozier

* Wing - Marcus Smart

* Wing - Semi Ojeleye

* Wing - Marcus Morris

* Big - Aron Baynes

That's a REALLY versatile defensive lineup.

What I would expect to see from other less-capable defensive teams is the key lessons more so than the specific scheme – give him space, cut passing lanes, and limit transition opportunities. Now evidently Simmons' teammates will still have a good chance of hitting their shots; they're professional basketballers playing in the best league in the world. But, this strategy is about limiting their effectiveness, Simmons' distribution, and disrupting the offense.

Something to really consider is that[ Simmons averaged the second-most offensive touches during the 2017-18 regular season](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612755), losing to only Russell Westbrook. Simmons’ 95.0 touches per game increase to 104.6 touches during the 76ers playoff run, almost 6 more touches than LeBron per game, and more than Westbrook.

When you take into account such a high volume of touches, it’s clear that he truly is the core facilitator in the Philadelphia squad – the next highest was Embiid at 76.4 (76.6 in the playoffs). This is also the core of the issue. If your main facilitator is unable to play his normal style of game, get passes to the right place, get his shots off, and the opposition is able to spy on offensive movement, your team won’t run as well as it should. Simmons is essentially unable to adapt his game to the Boston defense, due to the fact that he can’t generate any respect as a shooting threat.

**Simmons and Shooting**

Similarly, Simmons cannot be relied upon to drain high-percentage looks down the stretch. Even if Simmons were to remain on the court during clutch situations, and acted as the primary ball-handler, his odds of getting a successful go-ahead bucket are limited. Switch this idea, having Simmons on the court but not handling the ball, and you simply have one less player that the defense has to worry about on a catch-and-shoot situation, meaning that they are able to better focus their defensive energies to threats.

[Look again at this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=255&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU). Late in the fourth-quarter, Simmons really can't do much to help the team in this situation as the main playmaker. Embiid ends up pulling up from three, and Saric gets the second-chance points.

Yes, you could play Simmons down on the low-block in these situations as a lob threat and crashing the offensive glass – but that’s a bit insulting to your players with the league-high touches per game, no? Regardless, Simmons' low-post game is nowhere near developed enough to be a respectable threat - unless it's a mismatch (see the Rozier mismatch above), and his off-ball movement is generally above Westbrook-level, but not enough to create a huge threat.

Another potential threat to the Sixers is the prospect of Hack-a-Simmons. During the regular season, he shot **56% on 4.2 attempts/game**. Although this increased to 70% during the playoffs on a much smaller sample size, the question remains: Do you risk keeping on your main offensive threat in these late-game situations, when:

* He’s a risk of being sent to the line?
* He’s clearly struggling to generate points in a half-court offense?
* You’re facing a team with a good interior defender, and a switch-heavy defense, allowing him space and negating part of the offensive flow?

Let’s take a theoretical situation where Philly decides to take Simmons OUT of the lineup during the final three minutes of a playoff game. You’re now missing the remainder of Simmons’ 104 touches, and they have to be moved somewhere. Therefore, one of your other players has to step in and run the offense. The natural solution is either:

1. The reserve PG (T.J. McConnell) steps in and runs it as per previously
2. ISO every play with your most efficient scorer (Embiid - 0.82pts per ISO possession, on 1.6 possessions per game).

The first option is much less intimidating to the defensive team; no disrespect to T.J. McConnell (for whom I have a huge soft spot), but his playmaking is below-par in comparison to Simmons. The second option, as scary as it may seem, is not justifiable for long-stretches of game time. Embiid is a great scorer, but against a good defensive centre, not only is he going to get tired, but defenders will adapt.

Simply said, Ben Simmons NEEDS to develop some form of a shooting stroke. At the very minimum, a respectable FT percentage to allow him to stay on the court during late-game situations. If he doesn’t do so, then the 76ers need an adequate replacement.

**Wrong Hand Woes**

On the topic of Simmons’ shooting, Kevin O’Connor (Writer for The Ringer - shoutout u/KevinOConnorNBA love your work and hope you enjoy this), is ADAMANT that he uses the wrong hand for shooting.

In a recent interview with Fox Sports, Simmons was asked about whether even he knows which hand of his is more dominant, to which he replied, “You come to the gym. I’m gonna work out when I’m in Melbourne. You’ll see.” As cryptic as that may be, he continued when prodded to say, “In the NBA you’ve gotta play to what your strengths are. I never had real chances of just shooting. I never played in a year where I had to develop my shooting, because I was always better than most of the guys I played. Even this season without the jumper I was able to nearly have a triple-double every game.”

On the topic of whether developing shooting will be something he looks into in the near future, he said, “It just depends where I wanna be later in life. I can be satisfied with 15/8/8, or if I wanna be at that next level and be an all-star, then I add something to my game.”

[Here's Simmons hitting a nice-looking right-hand hook shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUN4rYSekYg)

In comparison, [here's a shot Simmons took left-handed during a pre-season workout.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&amp;v=ihyFtqYng5s)

See the difference? Nobody knows for sure, but it's something Simmons himself needs to establish.

**The Impact of Respect**

To wrap this all up, let’s take a look at what the Boston defence may look like should Simmons develop some form of shooting stroke.

If Ben Simmons would even attempt proper three-pointers during games, you may find that the space between himself and a defender like Horford may slowly shrink. Hell, even Marcus Smart, arguably one of the worst decent-volume shooters in the league, is taking open threes, shooting at a measly 29.3% career clip - at 4.2 attempts per game.

Below are some edited glimpses into how the defense could look if Simmons' developed any resemblance to a perimeter threat - taken from the original image above.

3pt% = 15-20

https://imgur.com/a/ETAkBoG
3pt% = 25

https://imgur.com/a/9AUT2VJ
3pt% = 30

This seemingly insignificant increase in space, caused by the increased respect for Simmons' genuine threat of a half-decent jumpshot changes the entire dynamic of the defense that the 76ers will face.

**Conclusion**

To reiterate, the downside is that the teams capable of providing such a defensive impact are few and far between in the current NBA, as it requires such a diverse lineup and widespread talent, plus solid coaching. During the regular season, there is also MUCH less time for these teams to focus on implementing defensive game-plans simply for one team; it’s during the coming playoffs that we’ll largely see whether franchises choose to adapt to such a style, and if so, then personally I find it hard to see Philly going too much further than this season without a solid replacement and/or third-scoring option (looking at you Fultz).

Regardless, I believe that this coming season we’ll see Ben Simmons still have a great follow-up to his rookie year – at least statistically. He’s evidently one of the most talented offensive players that the league has seen, with an unreal feel and read of the game. Will the Sixers manage to make it through a balanced eastern conference this year, with a strong Celtics squad and defensively-improved Raptors, amongst others? That remains to be seen."	nba

**Introduction**

The current Basketball Hall of Fame is just that, a hall of fame for anyone who has made a great contribution to the game of basketball. This is not only limited to play on the court in the NBA, but also play in college and internationally, coaching and management at all levels, and media personalities.

This exercise is so that [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) may have its own hall of fame based only on playing accomplishments in the NBA (and ABA in some cases). The goal of this is to have a much more exclusive club of NBA greats. The Basketball Hall of Fame has inductees every year, but the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) hall of fame will have inductees every week this offseason.

**How will it work?**

The first class will be composed of players who retired in 1960 or earlier. The second class will be composed of players who retired 1965 and earlier. The third class will be composed of players who retired 1970 and earlier, and so on.

The players listed must have higher than 20% hall of fame probability according to basketball-reference (just so that the ballots don't become too cluttered).

Each voter will get to choose between 1-5 players who they believe should make the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Any player who gets 50% or more of the vote will be inducted into the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Players who receive between 10% and 49.9% of the vote will be eligible in the next class.

Players who receive less than 10% of the vote will move down to the secondary ballot.

The same process is repeated for the secondary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the primary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will move down to the tertiary ballot.

The same process is again repeated for the tertiary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the secondary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will be ineligible for all future ballots. Also, players who receive 75% or more will skip the secondary and move straight to the primary ballot. New blood will be brought to this ballot from players who have more than 2% but less than 20% hall of fame probability.

Every other day the ballot will be posted as well as the results from the previous two days.

At the end of each week the inductees, their percentage of the votes, and whether they were first ballot, second ballot, etc will be posted as well as the ballot for the next class."	nba

"MJ's average of 30.1 PPG for his career (Even higher if he hadn't spent 2 years with the Wizards) seems pretty insurmountable.

I suppose if someone were to come into the NBA with an almost inconceivable level of talent, it'd be possible, but that seems somewhat likely.

West even went on to state that Bryant's workouts were some of the best he had seen. Immediately after the draft, Dave Cowens expressed that the Hornets had no use for him. Fifteen days later, West traded his starting center, Vlade Divac to the Hornets for the young Kobe Bryant.

Was there any reason for this? Was it just a coincidence, with a lot of players improving at the same time? Was it because pretty much every team in the league had its own star this season? Was it due to pace or something? I'm just amazed how THIS many star players had career seasons."	nba

This non biased stat represents a couple of things.  
  
The strengths of these players are that they are able to score efficiently. A 62% TS was important because you wouldn’t want an inefficient chucker like James Harden, with a TS% of 61.9 making the list.  
  
It also illustrates an ability to play well defensively by reading passing lanes, intercepting well and being strong one on one or with weak side defence. 1.7% was the limit as poor defenders Mike Conley (1.6) and Clint Capela (1.4) could have snuck in otherwise.  
  
Finally an assist percentage was used to demonstrate that this player is unselfish and a strong playmaker. Someone you would want to have on your team. I decided on 22% as the limit as you wouldn’t value selfish ball hogs like Victor Oladipo (21.2%) and Jimmy Butler (20.6%)

So as you can see, not cherry picked at all."	nba
70	[OC] NBA Players are the Highest Earning Young People in America	"Bloomberg released an article today stating that only 45 Americans under 26 years old filed taxes in 2016 with gross income of $10 million or greater.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-05/young-and-rich-45-americans-under-age-26-earned-10-mln-or-more?srnd=premium

Of these 45 Americans, we can deduce that quite a few consist of NBA players.  For multiple reasons, there is not a perfect way to know exactly how many players had over $10 million in gross taxable income in 2016 - taxable income does not equal income earned, there are parts of two NBA seasons in 2016, agents take a cut of salaries, NBA players also have substantial income from endorsements, etc.  

However, if we use 2016-2017 NBA salaries as a proxy for 2016 taxable income for NBA players (salaries in 2016-2017 were higher than the previous year, but since we are excluding endorsement money, I think it's fair to use the higher salary number), we can see that the following players who are American citizens under 26 years old broke the $10 million threshold that year:

Bradley Beal
Anthony Davis
Allen Crabbe
Kawhi Leonard
Kyrie Irving
Tobias Harris
John Wall
Khris Middleton
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
Brandon Knight
John Henson
Jordan Clarkson
Solomon Hill
Derrick Favors
Austin Rivers
Alec Burks
Terrence Ross

TLDR: using this methodology, which is only an approximation of actual taxable earnings and is more of a back of the napkin calculation than an exhaustive study, 17 out of the 45 (or 38%) of the highest earning Americans under 26 in 2016 were NBA players."	nba

91	Here's why the Orlando Magic are the true heirs to the Eastern Conference throne	"Everyone remembers how good the Magic were for the first 12 games of the 17-18 season, going 8-4 with absurdly incomprehensible statistics that seemed to defy the laws of nature itself. They didn't go, uh, as well for the rest of the season, but it is clear to see that this hugely disrespected team is more than its final record would suggest. Here's why the Orlando Magic are the real successors to LeBron's dynasty:

\-Losing Shelvin ""Dishing Dimes"" Mack and his 3.9 assists per game isn't ideal, but the true solution can be found in Point Gordon. This could be the season where Air Gordon becomes the Magic's true playmaker, and if you watch his highlights ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMgQWKzQm8#t=1m38s)), he has the vision to make it work. If only he had the foresight to see that using a drone in a dunk contest isn't as good as jumping over a KIA ™ automobile.

\-Mo ""Long Boi"" Bamba is not only a solid shooter and shotblocker, but he had a rap song named after him BEFORE he even made it to the NBA! Plus Sheck Wes was really catchy on No Bystanders and his adlibs are pure heat, so I'll give Mo props by default.

\-They traded for Timofey ""Solid contributor to a title-winning team"" Mozgov. Yes, THE Mosgov that exploded for the best NBA game in history ([https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bk6qToGIIAEHmox.jpg)) with a whopping 93 points and 29 rebounds. If you can find a more dominant big man, then you're probably watching old Wilt tapes.

With solid contributors like Nikola ""He's an All-Star if teams were selected after 4 games"" Vucevic and Evan ""Don't Google his last name"" Fournier, as well as Jonathan ""KD if his elite scoring was actually elite defence"" Isaac, these players aren't to be underestimated.

92	Analysis of the Economic Impact of Constructing a NBA Arena on the Host City	"https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2014&amp;q=nba+statistical+analysis&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2938&amp;context=cmc_theses

Here’s an interesting study I found regarding the implementation of basketball arenas and the effect it has on the local economy.

**Abstract**
&gt;Using economic data collected from 24 different Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US, this thesis investigates the impact of constructing a new National Basketball Association (NBA) arena on the host city’s economy. When a simplistic model is implemented, which does not control for other economic factors or individual subject heterogeneity, significantly positive economic impacts of arena construction are observed. However, when a more appropriate model specification is implemented that controls for economic activity and individual heterogeneity, these effects are no longer statistically significant. This comparative analysis ultimately highlights the importance of appropriate model specification and supports the conclusion that new NBA arenas, by themselves, **are not significant catalysts of urban economic development.**"	nba

94	Skylar Diggins Vs Harrison Barnes (WNBA vs NBA wage gap thoughts)	"So this was planned to made into a youtube video but I figured I'd post it here to stir the pot as well. This post is in regards to Skylar digginss comments made earlier this week.


 1) What is the wage gap? The wage gap is the difference between male and female earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings, according to the OECD. Basically its the idea that women are oppressed and make less money than their male counterparts for the same job/work."" ""It's the belief that just because of the gender you identify/born into, will make less money in a unfair way. Now why am I bringing this up? 
	: ""If you follow sports even a smidget, then you've probably heard the recent noise in regards to ""wage gap"" between WNBA players and NBA players. The most recent woman to make a stir (depending on when you see this video) was Skylar Diggins. 

2) Skylar Kierra Diggins-Smith (born August 2, 1990) She is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Wings of the WNBA. She was drafted 3rd overall by the Tulsa Shock in the 2013 WNBA draft. In high school, she was the National Gatorade Player of the Year, the Gatorade Female Athlete of the Year, and a McDonald's All-American. Diggins played point guard for Notre Dame, where she led Notre Dame to three consecutive Final Fours and two consecutive NCAA championship appearances. She finished her Notre Dame career ranked first in points and steals, second in assists, and as a two-time winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award as the top point guard in the nation ""and yes this is a copy and paste from wiki-pedia lol"" 
	""The point is...... This woman is not ignorant when it comes to basketball. She has the experience, tenure, and skills to back herself up as one of the great WNBA players. She's won many accolades and stands out among her peers, buuuuuuut why are we talking about her? Well, while her skills didnt make headline news..... her mouth did. She, like others before her, made a statement by calling out the wage-gap in sports specifically WNBA vs NBA. She even fired shots at a current NBA players (WHO PLAYS IN THE SAME CITY!!!!),  Harrison Barnes. Unfortunately we live in 2018 and, understandably, while she may only have meant to use Barnes as a example, she was eaten alive by the internet. Fortunately for you I decided to do just a small amount of research and look into the comments she made as well as the accuracy of her comments. and  I also took a look at recent NBA/WNBA seasons for stats in regards to why this ""wage-gap"" might exist but we'll get to those later. Firstly I'd like to just bring up some of the comments she has reportedly made as well as links to those webpages, they'll be down in the description""

3)Quotes: *Before we start, I just want to point out that these are quotes I picked for the sake of this video. I wanted to be able to represent the argument as much as I could using both positive and negative quotes to give you a better idea of what was said and why. There may have been other qutoes that have made headline news that I just missed and I'll go ahead and apologize for it. That being said, lets begin. 
 
	
So this first quote has to be the most popular.....
	:) ""Players in the NBA get about 50% of the revenue. For women, the percentage is in the twenties. So before we even talk about base salary or anything like that, we don’t even get paid the same percentage of the revenue that we bring in, which is kind of unbelievable. People try to hijack this issue and say that women’s basketball may not be as interesting a game, because they disparage women in sports, period. But we don’t even make the same percentage of revenue! And jersey sales…we don’t get any of it. The men do. And I have had a top-five jersey for three or four years in the WNBA.""

Response: This is about as neutral of the quotes as it gets. She outlines real issues that need discussion and research. The lack of revenue from jersey sales is what I agree with the most however that's an issue you need to take up with your league but also keep in mind...... you dont sell many jerseys as it is. In regards to disparaging women sports, in this case basketball, thats just false. WNBA struggles with rating and viewership sure but NCAA womens basketball has a high viewership and the championship game received 3.8 million viewers. While you cant chalk that up as attendance I dont think you can make the claim we disparage women in sports. The truth of the matter is the WNBA markets itself horribly. She claims we dont like women sports or dont want them but do you think people know who serena williams is? Ronda Rousey? Danica Patrick? We have female sport headlines, just not in your field of expertise. Overall I see this as the prime quote because it outlines where she was right but also the sense of entitlement that I'll touch on later. 


	:) ""Only the top 1% of all women who play the game make it to [the WNBA], ""But what am I supposed to tell my daughter? This lack of gender parity and the wage gap will be there, whatever she wants to do. She will never make the same amount of money as a man. She will never make the same amount of money as my son will.""

Response: Sooooo the top 1%? Thats the same for men so no dice there. She then trails off trying to tie in the regular gender wage gap and her argument. I dont have time to discuss the full Wage-gap argument but heres the summary.... There is no statistical data to definitively prove one side or other. It's a touchy subject that has been intermixed with lies and false facts, like her comment. You're comparing the same fields of work yes, but like you said its a top 1%, hardly close to the average everyday woman complaining of the wage gap. This quote from her highlights the prime issue with wage arguments.... It's not connected together, it's a opinion not fact, and it's supplemented with no information or prime examples. I dont expect her to have them ready to go but just spouting it off in a way thats matter of fact is creates even more chaos and keeps us further from having an actually conversation about it while also pushing many away from her and her message. 

	:) ""I’m the highest paid player on the Dallas Wings, and my salary is in the low six figures. [Harrison Barnes, the highest paid player on the Dallas Mavericks, made $24 million last season.] He’s definitely younger than me. Do you know his stats? Was he an All-Star? I mean, it doesn’t matter. But last year, I was First Team All-WNBA, which only goes to five players. I was also a WNBA All-Star for the third time.""

Response: Sense of entitlement..... Im this great, I do this, I accomplished that. Why should someone I view as inferior to me, accolade wise, make more than me? Did you forget he's a NBA champion? Are you a champion? ""Did you see his stats"" hahaha hunny, I looked up both of yalls stats..... Guess what? He has/had better numbers than you. So technically speaking, yes he should make more than you on the simple fact that his production is greater than yours in the same field right? Think about this..... All of his stats, except for average assists, are better than you yet he didnt make an all NBA team or an All Start team. If we remove gender and play this equal, such is a the basis for your whole issue, then yes.... you should make less than him. 

	:) ""I'm at a loss for words sometimes, talking about this,"" she said. ""It's unfortunate that men make more money for the same amount of work, or even less work.""

Response: MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM heres the thing..... Your total season is 34 games, after playoffs it maxs at 43. The NBA almost plays twice as many games as you in the regular season, and depending on game outcomes, the playoffs make it 3x as many played games. How is that equal or less work? They play more games, they travel much more frequently, and their seasons can run up to almost 8-9 months. How is this equal work. You do less work by this logic. So yes more hours should equal more pay.

	:) ""I would be curious to know how successful we could be with such a great product if we had the same platform as the guys do,"" she said. ""Think about the marketing dollars that they spend on guys, the platform given to them. Branding opportunities, TV deals, endorsement deals. It's kind of like the chicken and the egg.""

Response: I dont think I really need to respond to this much. Unfortunately, on average women are less athletically gifted than men. Thats just factual. So yes, if the same amount of money was spent marketing you and growing your buzz, ratings and attendance might increase. But for the casual/simple fan, I dont believe theyd watch a WNBA game over an NBA game even if this all magically happened. The average fan dosnt understand the nuances of the game, by and large they are attracted to the insane feats of athleticism. Im not saying women cant be just as athletic as men, but if we had to put a number on it I'd say 1-10. 

	:) ""As athletes, we have to fight. As women, we have to fight. And we need more people at our table to fight with us,"" she told Wealthsimple. ""There needs to be more women and more people of color hired so we can curate our own sports stories. And we need men speaking out about these things.""

Response: The funniest part of all of this is she says ""we need men speaking out about these things"" well if you keep calling them out and putting them on blast for something they have no control of, why would they help you? Why should they/I fight for you when you've berated and belittled us all so you can point out how youve been neglected?  I just.... I cant, sorry no more quotes, my brain is about to explode......

So we got past the hard part..... now some fun data facts but first let me explain the issues I see with the WNBA

:) ""There’s a case they’re underpaid based on current conditions. There’s an even better case their product would improve if they were treated better. Due to the WNBA’s low wages, many WNBA players play overseas during the offseason. Couple that with long commercial flights, the players get worn down.""
	:) Not alot of marketing done for players/teams/games
	:) Far less income

Okay now stats......

NBA STATS:
	Games: 82+ playoffs
	Total revenue: 2015-2016 (5.9 billion)
	Age: Began in 1946
	Total Attendance: 14 million+ ( http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance )

WNBA STATS:
	Games: Total of 34, 43 with playoffs.
	Total Revenue: 50-65 million
	Age: Began in 1996 (50 years after mens NBA started)
	Total Attendance:  1,574,078 (2017) - 7,716 fans per game. (about the same average as NBA in 1966)
	2017: WNBA averaged 7,716 fans per game, 12 teams, players make between 39,000 - 115,000, split 11million in % revenue with players. (roughly 55 million total made). They only paid players 22.8 % of revenue that year, two years prior they were paid 33%. Link: https://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2017/09/how-the-wnba-is-underpaying-its-players/


Now just for some more reasons, in particular, of why Harrison barnes would still be worth more than you in the same league and same circumstances.

Harrison Barnes: 
	Height: 6'8
	Weight: 225lbs
	Vert: No-step (38 inches, 4rth highest in nba history)
	NBA Champion
	Stats (2018): 18.9 pts, 6.1 reb, 2.0 ast, 44.5 FG% (only averaged 7.0 FG made per game) 35.7% 3pt.

Skylar Diggins:
	Height: 5'9
	Wight: 145 lbs
	Vert: unknown * CANT DUNK
	All-star, All WNBA
	Stats (2018): 17.9 pts, 3.4 reb, 6.2 ast, 40.1 FG% (only averaged 5.9 FG made per game *11.8 PTS) 29.7% 3pt.

Didnt believe me earlier when I said she had worse stats? My man Barnes has almost a full 12 inches of height and could probably get his knee caps above your head when he jumps. Seriously though, if you wanna be truly equal then understand this..... You're as tall as Nate robinson was, half his speed, and put up worse numbers than the man you called out. So if I were to evaluate you for pay off performance, Yes I'd pay Barnes more. Maybe you didnt just mean only him but you tossed his name out and thats your own fault. 

To close, I think you can see where I stand. This was a ignorant person making ignorant comments with no evidence or information to go off. Skylar Diggins has a sense of entitlement that she is owed something. Growing up my parents taught me you arent owed anything. You work and work and even still you might not get what you ""think"" you deserve. Thats life. We can make it better, but not with half-witted conversations comming from people who cant bother to see the real issues. I cant believe this has blown up the way it has, its stupid honestly. Yes we should talk about it, yes we could do better, yes in some aspects it may seem unfair but before we start shouting to the rooftops ""WAGE-GAP!!!!"" lets remember.

Your league has 10 teams, 22 teams smaller than the NBA
Your league plays a max of 43 games, almost half of a REGULAR NBA SEASON
Your league only had about 1/14th the attendance that the NBA had
Your league pulls in 50-65 million of total revenue, the NBA pulled in 5.9 BILLION
Your league started in 1996, NBA started 50 years prior. Oh and fun fact, your league is 21/22 years old. You have a higher average attendance and views than the NBA did at 21/22 years of age. You just have to wait and grow, they did. 

There's no perfect solution to any issue in the world, but we create more issues when we speak out of turn or out our..... you know whats. I dont think she meant it all this drastically to the point the media has blown it up as, maybe she did, but once it's been said you cant take it back. You unintentionally put a person on blast and had the audacity to say that it's not fair on you. Skylar Diggins has a self sense of entitlement that cant be justified with facts or statistical data. All she runs off is opinion, feeling, and word baiting for the masses intentional or not. I dont respect her and I stand by all of the claims in the video. Thank you for watching, please leave a comment and lets have a real discussion. Bye

for me, id have to go with cov being overrated by our fans. cov is a good player but it seems like over at r/sixers many think hes clear cut the 3rd best and will attack you and call you a casual if you suggest otherwise. hes a great defender with an okay 3 ball thats extremely streaky but his 3 pt shooting is overrated because people see 37% when that is only so high because of an insane 15 game start to the year. but beyond that he shot 33% the final 74 games through playoffs. hes got pretty terrible shot selection and doesnt do anything else well offensively other then shoot 3s. he also makes some astoundingly dumb plays at times. i like cov a lot, but it frustrates me seeing people say hes easily our 3rd best player when dario is clear cut the 3rd best on our team imo

He was also clutch in Game 4 (including a huge three if front of the celtics bench)

Game 2 :

Game 4 :

And the 4th quarter in game 5 was a master piece with the big help of Wade : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgLMI784M4E

An incredible comeback, two huge cltuch shots and a game winning block.

And then Dallas happened. Such a mystery. I understand good defense, but such failure ? It is also important to remind everyone that Dallas changed Lebron skillset and mindset for the best.

"I've noticed more and more recently how people have started complaining that today's basketball is too soft and involves too much ""jacking"" of threes. Some people don't enjoy skyfuckery as much as others I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

The implication seems to be that the mid-2000s iso-ball era was more physical and entertaining.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course that's exactly what people said in the mid-2000s iso-ball era, i.e., hand-checking and all the new rules have ruined the game, no real big men anymore, too soft, etc.

I went down the list of PPG leaders, choosing a random team for every player, and when the players got bad I randomly selected rookies. So if your team has rookies, it is because they didnt get many players at the start.  It isn't a draft, as the same team can come up and get 5 players in a row if the random 1-30 number generator picks the same number. I picked 6 players for every team. Not all teams will be equal, as the Warriors roster was completely picked before the Mavericks got their first player. I then assigned a random coach to every team. Here are the results:

146	Is the 2012-2013 Lakers the biggest flop in NBA History ?	Before the season started , Many experts predict the Lakers as the favorites to win the championship some even speculate they may break the bulls 72-10 record. They have 4 all stars on their team Nash, Kobe,Pau and Dwight but Injuries, Chemistry and Bad coaching held this team back so the question Is the 2012-2013 Lakers the biggest flop in NBA History ? Or is there some team who had a bigger flop maybe the 73-9 Warriors, the 03-04 Lakers or the Big 5 Nets ?	nba
147	How is the NBA associated with the WNBA? Does the NBA own it, or just support and promote it?

Is the WNBA completely separate and the NBA just does them a solid and promotes them? How does it work? 	nba

149	"The flashiest playmakers according to NBA's official ""Top 100 Plays: 2018 Season"""	"Hey all! If you missed it, the NBA released their official [top 100 plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQ4oTKQw3o) video a couple of days ago, and I thought it could be cool to see which players had the most highlighted plays, as it's sorta of a proxy for who the NBA considered their flashiest players last season. 

**Overall Standings**: I'm counting any direct involvement in the positive side of the play - hockey assist, assist, scoring, blocking a shot, getting the steal to set up a fast break, etc. Getting dunked on doesn't count, and setting up the play outside of the highlight shown doesn't count. When players traded buzzer beaters I counted both. With no further ado:

(1) LeBron James: 14

(2) Anthony Davis: 7

(3) Ben Simmons: 6

(4) Giannis Antetokounmpo: 5

(T-5) Larry Nance Jr: 4

(T-5) Russell Westbrook: 4

(T-7) Joel Embiid: 3

(T-7) James Harden: 3

(T-7) Kyrie Irving: 3

(T-7) Khris Middleton: 3

(T-7) Terry Rozier: 3

(T-12) Carmelo Anthony: 2

(T-12) Gary Harris: 2

**Notable Snubs:** These are the All-NBA/Defensive Team/All Stars who had no featured highlights: Aldridge, Beal, Covington, Curry, Cousins, Dragic, Gobert, Draymond Green, Jrue Holiday, Horford, Love, Lowry, Dejounte Murray, Klay Thompson, and Towns.

More than half of the All Rookie Team actually made it, which is pretty darn impressive. Simmons, Mitchell, Tatum, Smith Jr, Collins, and Jackson all appear in this compilation, while Kuzma, Markkanen, Ball, and Bogdanovic do not (though Ball, Markkanen, and Kuzma do appear getting posterized).


**Team Wide Results**: Most total team highlights goes, unsurprisingly, to the Cavaliers. When LeBron already makes up 14% of the list, it's not hard to think that this is going to end up happening. Nance adds 3, JR Smith adds 2, and Hill, Green, Osman, and Zizic each add 1 for a total of 23 highlights (with some double dipping).

The most total players from one team, rather than just highlights, was a tie. The Cavs had the 7 players above appear, but the other team was more surprising - the Suns. Although none of their players had multiple highlights, Booker, Chriss, Ulis, Jackson, Len, Chandler, and Bender all appear once.

The Pistons, Wizards, Kings, Bulls, Hawks, Magic, Spurs, and Clippers each have only 1 highlighted play. About 1/4 of the teams in the league are represented by 8% of the plays in this video.

The Bulls, Wizards, Magic, and Kings all had only one player appear in a highlight. The other teams with only one highlights feature multiple players.

Interestingly, the only Warriors to make the video are Livingston (the crossover on Harden) and Durant (a great block and the clutch long shot in the finals). The NBA champs only had 3 total highlights, and none included a pass or assist. 4 of the 11 snubbed All Stars are on the Warriors 2018-19 roster, and the only 2 starters in the All Star Game are both on the Warriors roster. Maybe parity exists after all /s"	nba

169	In his last 16 games, Brandon Ingram averaged 17.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists with a 59.0 TS% in 32.7 minutes per game	"In 7 of those 16 games, he started at the point guard position in the absence of Lonzo Ball, where he averaged 19.6 points, 5.6 assists and 3.7 rebounds with a TS% of 62.2% in 34.3 minutes per game.

Another interesting thing to note is that Ingram was able to shoot 48.6% from 3 in those 16 games on 2.2 attempts per game. That is a good sign for the Lakers as with LeBron coming in he will need to attempt more 3s than he has before to reach his peak effectiveness, and this shows he could be able to do it on well above average efficiency.

Ingram had only just turned 21 yesterday so he still has a lot of room to improve upon his stellar form in the last quarter of his season and may be able to become a very reliable secondary option for a LeBron-led Lakers squad in the coming years."	nba

The one guy came to mind is Jamaal Magloire. He's probably one of the worst all stars ever, but he was productive as a player with 14 years of experience. But in today's NBA, I honestly feel he would not get drafted in the first round, and will be out of the league in less than two years. We just don't see that type of slow post player anymore.

"Players can be from any era and are in the prime of their career (unless stated otherwise). This is more so me pondering the best team you could put together and not asking the best five players ever. Won’t take personal chemistry/ability to get along into account and the team would play with the rules of today’s NBA. 

My lineup:

-PG: John Stockton 
-SG: Michael Jordan 
-SF: LeBron James 
-PF: Kevin Durant 
-C: Hakeem Olajuwon 

-Offense: Stockton pick and rolls/pops with LeBron, Durant, and Hakeem would be nearly unstoppable. If LeBron runs the offense Stockton is capable of hitting shots from behind the arc. Jordan and Durant can score at will giving the three others plenty of open looks. 

-Defense: This is where Stockton and Hakeem earn their spot. Can you imagine being glad you aren’t being guarded by Jordan only to get locked up and stripped by Stockton? Hakeem stops dominate low post scorers from taking over and is quick enough to switch up to most 3s. Not to mention if LeBron actually tries he can be an amazing defender given his IQ and athleticism. "	nba

182	What are your most FLAMING hot takes ?	"Basically the hottest takes. The downvoted comments will be considered the HOTTEST.
I’ll start:

Kawhi Leonard is an amazing player but he gets so much credit from one series(Memphis 16-17). One series doesn’t really do much imo. He’s still top 5 tho


AD isn’t a top 5 player right now.

Steven Adams is massively overrated on this sub mostly because he’s likeable and says mate a lot.

A lot of all stars today are better than majority of all stars in the past era 

Warriors didn’t ruin the NBA. They made it more exciting. We have teams who can harm them now: mostly Rockets and Celtics/Raptors.

Pacers will got to the ECF

JR Smith is actually a very good player

Carmelo is still decent(not a very hot take)

194	Oldest and Youngest Teams in NBA History	"With teams like the Phoenix Suns stockpiling young players over the last few years, it got me wondering about the youngest and oldest teams in NBA history. Here's what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

YOUNGEST TEAM: 2005-06 Atlanta Hawks-- average age of 22.7 years old. The youngest player in the rotation was rookie Marvin Williams (19) while the oldest player was Ty Lue (28). Other members included Josh Smith (20), Zaza Pachulia (21), and Joe Johnson (24). Overall, 10 players with less than 4 years of experience saw the floor that season. Their final record was 26-56. 

&amp;#x200B;

OLDEST TEAM (tied): 2000-01 Utah Jazz-- average age of 32.0 years old. The oldest player in the rotation was John Stockton (38) while the youngest was Jacque Vaughn (25). Other members included Karl Malone (37), Olden Polynice (36), and John Starks (35). Overall, 8 players over the age of 30 saw the floor that season. Their final record was 53-39, losing in the first round to young Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks.

&amp;#x200B;

OLDEST TEAM, pt. 2: 1997-98 Houston Rockets. The oldest player in the regular rotation was Eddie Johnson (38), though Charles Jones (40) also played sparingly throughout the season. Others included Clyde Drexler, Kevin Willis, and Hakeem Olajuwon (all 35) as well as Charles Barkley and Mario Elie (both 34). The youngest players in the rotation were Othella Harrington and Rodrick Rhodes (24). They finished with a 0.500 record and ironically lost to a slightly younger Malone/Stockton duo in the first round. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I doubt any team is poised to break the record for youngest this year, but that could change once the league reopens the draft for high school grads-- especially with more teams taking a ""process"" approach. "	nba

It's NOT a good thing to force yourself to wake up way too early (and let's not kid ourselves and think these guys are going to bed at 8:30 to account for the five AM alarm clock). It's actually extremely stupid.

Cutting your sleep short is literally harmful to your body, and NBA level athletes are people who need every bit of the rest since their bodies are pretty much on a constant recovery mode. Studies have shown that only an extremely small part of the population - MJ and Kobe are good examples of these kind of physical and mental freaks - actually gets enough REM sleep by sleeping under 7,5 hours a night even though most of us think we are OK with 6 hours a night."	nba

207	Kobe's 06 season is the best Scoring season since 1990.	"The only 2 players with seasons that might be close are KD in 14 and Curry in 16

Kobe 05-06 35.4 5.3 4.5 45/35/85 

Durant 13-14 32 7.4 5.5 50/39/87

Curry 15-16 30.1 5.4 6.7 50/45/91 

So kobe's efficiency is worse and it just looks like volume but he was playing in the Iso Era where league Average Ts% was .525 Kobe was at .559 ts% which is .34 % better than average 

Kobe had  50 point Games 

In 50 point games he averaged 

57.5/7/3 and he shot 54/45/90 shooting 

KD had 2 50 point games he averaged

52.7 /8/6.5 And he shot 56/57/80

Curry had 3 50 point games he averaged

51.8/6/6.2 and shot 65/61/93 

From this it looks like when Kobe went off he was very efficient but curry blows KD and Kobe out of the water with his 65/61/93 

Another thing to take into consideration is Kobe played in a slower pace pace was only at 90.1 where Durant was at 93.9 and curry was at 95.8 its currently at 97.3

So if we look at per 100 possessions 

Kobe 45.6 ppg 

Durant 41.8 

Curry 42.5 

So even if we keep everything even for them Kobe still put up more points

The most telling thing to me is Kobe scored 36% of all lakers points that's even more than Jordan's 37 ppg season where he only got 34%

Kobe 36% of team points scored

Durant 30% of team points scored 

Curry 26% of team points scored

Curry led his team to the #1 offense with Klay Thompson Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes as his starters 

Durant led his team to the #6 offense with Westbrook, Ibaka and Reggie Jackson as his starters

Kobe led his team to the #8 offense with Odom, Smush Parker, Kwame Brown and Luke Walton as his starters. 

As a matter of fact the lakers were the #3 offense with Kobe on the court vs the #30 offense with him off the court.

The final point i want to make is Kobe averaged 40+ ppg twice 

In January he averaged 43/6/4 on 47/40/90 shooting 

In April he averaged 42/6/4 on 52/41/83 shooting 

In fact Kobe from December 12th until February Kobe averaged 40/6/4 on 47/37/86 shooting

Durants best stretch is when he averaged 35ppg through 28 games without Westbrook 

Curry was pretty consistant but his best month by far  being 37 ppg on 55/53/87 shooting

So if you take all my points into consideration then i think it's pretty obvious Kobe had the best offensive season since 1990 "	nba

220	Nick Young and Cocaine Arrests, a Correlation? [OC]	"As we know, Nick Young loves cocaine, so much that he [suggested that cocaine should be legalized](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8simcz/nick_young_calls_for_the_legalization_of_cocaine/). This got me thinking, could there possibly be a correlation between the number of cocaine-related arrests and his performance that year (according to his PER). 

&amp;nbsp;

[Here is a graph showing the number of cocaine-related arrests and his PER.](https://imgur.com/uVtzNfh) 

The correlation coefficient or the 'r' value is -0.703. Due to the fact that -0.703 relatively close to -1, perfect negative correlation, we can see that the two variables may be correlated. 

&amp;nbsp;

The negative correlation shows us that as the number of cocaine-related arrests increases, Nick Young's PER decreases. From this, we can draw ONLY ONE conclusion, that Nick Young performs worse when more people are arrested for cocaine, as he is directly affected by their plight affecting his performance.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, we can now see the underlying reason for Nick Young's view on the legalization of cocaine. It is not based on ethics or legal reasons, but actually, because he knows that if it is legalized and arrests go down, his performance as shown by his PER, has no limits. Thus this will enable him to become one of the best players in the NBA without the plight of his fellow cocaine lovers weighing him down.

222	Idea for 87 game NBA Season/League restructure.	"Most ideas I see about restructuring the NBA's regular season/playoff formats involve getting rid of conferences, redrawing divisional lines, weighting team's schedules with divisional play, and rewarding division winners with playoff spots as they do in the NFL. 

I don't like it. 

You still get talent disparity across the divisions. In the same way good Eastern teams benefit from the weakness of the rest of the conference, a bad division could send a mediocre team to the playoffs due to the fact that they're playing more games against inferior opponents. 

You'll still get bad teams going to the playoffs and better teams missing out. 

So here's an alternative solution. 

No conferences. 

No divisions. 

87 game season where every team plays every other team 3 times. Shorten the preseason and start everything a little earlier to fit in those 5 extra games. 

1-16 makes the playoffs. 

End of season records really show who deserves to make the playoffs because every team had the exact same strength of schedule. There's no tiebreaker scenarios because every team played each other an odd number of games. "	nba
223	KD never had 3 All Stars on his team in OKC.	"KD spend 8 years in OKC.  

In 5 of those years KD had another All Star with him (Westbrook).

He has NEVER had that 3rd All Star to help carry the load between KD/Russ.  Never in 8 years.  This is very significant.

FACT: Lebron James never won a Championship without at least THREE ALL STARS on his team. In Miami he had Wade and Bosh.  In Cleveland he had Love and Irving. 

FACT: And when KD had a 'near' All Star in 22 year old James Harden he made the Finals at age 23 and lost to one of the All Time GOATS.

Instead of a 3rd All Star here is who KD had:

2010/2011 - Jeff Green played the 2nd most minutes. When Jeff is your 3rd best player you are in a world of hurt.

2011/2012 - James Harden. 22 years old. 6MOTY.  Very talented but his youth showed up in the Finals. Not quite an All Star in 2011/2012.

2012/2013 - Serge Ibaka. A solid player. But way to limited to be an All Star. Can't dribble. Can't pass.  Can't post up. At this point he was averaging 0.7 three point attempts a game. His main weapon was a mid-range jumper.  Again a solid role player but not the 3rd Star you need to win the Finals.

2013/2014 - Serge Ibaka. Same deal as previous year.

2014/2015 - Serge again. This is when he started shooting more 3 pointers. Problem he takes so long to shoot that teams can close out at the last second. Also he has no passing or dribbling ability so you can totally sell out on close outs without worrying that he will make you pay.  At this point his defense was also beginning to decline.

2015/2016 - Ibaka again. His shot dropped HARD. Shot only 32% from 3FG. His athleticism declined hard and was no longer an elite defender.

So there you go.

KD never had that 3rd Star necessary to win Rings.

Again Lebron never won a Ring without THREE ALL STARS on his team.  Yet we expect KD to win a Ring in OKC with only TWO STARS?  "	nba

233	LeBron could very plausibly overtake Dirk for sixth all-time in scoring when they play each other this October	"LeBron is currently 149 points behind Dirk for all-time regular season scoring. The Mavs and Lakers play for the first time on October 31, the eighth game of the season for each team. Last season, LeBron and Drik averaged 27.5 and 12.0 PPG, respectively. If they kept up this rate, LeBron would be 41 points behind Dirk going into this matchup. While it's unlikely that LeBron would outscore Dirk by 41, it's very plausible that by the time they play each other, LeBron will be well within 41 points (or possibly already ahead of Dirk by then) given that Dirk is probably declining at a faster rate (will score fewer PPG), LeBron will supposedly be playing off the ball, Dirk might miss a game or two beforehand, etc. So essentially, there's a very real chance that LeBron will overtake Dirk for the sixth all-time scoring position when they play each other in person. 

This would be really cool. It would also allow for the possibility of Dirk's regaining his spot in the same game, which would be pretty fun."	nba

235	Underrated Candidate for Greatest Game of All Time:Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals	"The 1976 NBA Finals were played between the Boston Celtics and the Phoenix Suns. The Celtics finished at the top of the East with a 54-28 record behind the stellar play of Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White. The Suns meanwhile, were the 3rd seed in the West with a 42-40 record. They upset the defending champion Golden State Warriors in 7 games in the WCF to advance to the finals. The Celtics won Games 1 and 2, but Phoenix clawed back to win Game 3 and Game 4, tying the series and setting the stage for a Game 5 at the Boston Garden. The game was pretty ordinary throughout regulation, though there was some controversy, as Paul Silas of the Celtics attempted to call a timeout near the end of regulation with the score tied 95-95. The Celtics did not have any timeouts, so this should have been a technical foul and a free throw should have been awarded to the Suns, but the referee didn't grant it. The game went into OT, where it again ended with the scores level, though there was another controversy regarding the clock, as the clock did not start when Havlicek attempted a game winning shot. The final 20 seconds of the second OT were the most notable part of the game. In those 20 seconds, here's what happened.

1.Dick Van Arsdale hit a jumper for the Suns to cut the C's lead to 1. The score was 109-108 at this point.

2. The Celtics attempted to inbound the ball to Havlicek, but Paul Westphal was there to knock it out and somehow managed to save it to Van Arsdale, who passed to Curtis Perry, who missed an 18 footer.

3. Havlicek went for the rebound, but couldn't secure it, tapping the ball back to Perry.

4. Perry drained a 15 footer to put the Suns ahead, 110-109 with just 6 seconds left.

5. Havlicek then drove into the teeth of the Phoenix defense and banked a leaning one hander off the glass to put Boston ahead as the horn sounded.

6. The Celtics fans poured onto the court to celebrate taking a 3-2 series lead and the Celtics headed back to their locker room. However, the game was not over. As Rick Barry, who was analyzing the game on CBS, pointed out, there were still 2 seconds left on the clock when the ball went through the hoop. The officials agreed, putting 1 second back on the game clock, and ordered the Celtics back onto the court to finish the game.

7. The Suns still didn't have much of a chance, as they were inbounding the ball under their basket with one second left. Then Paul Westphal showed his brilliance. He signaled to the referee for a timeout, even though the Suns did not have one. Since this was a technical, Boston received one free throw. Crucially though, the Suns now received the ball at half-court. Jo Jo White drained the free throw to give the Celtics a 112-110 lead.

8. During the Suns' timeout, the fans were still on the floor, interrupting Suns coach  John Macleod as he was drawing up a play for the final basket. Suns' players repeatedly had to shove the fans out of the way, and Phoenix general manager Jerry Colangelo even threatened to not bring his team back to the Boston Garden for Game 7. Once play finally resumed, Phoenix's Gar Heard took the inbounds pass from Perry and made a buzzer-beating shot (a turn-around jumper at the top of the key) for the Suns that tied the score yet again, 112–112.

Late in the 3rd overtime, Boston held a 128-122 lead, as Glenn Mcdonald, a reserve who had averaged 5.6 PPG for the Celtics that year, scored 6 in this overtime alone. Westphal scored the next 4 for Phoenix, but could not get the ball back for the rest of OT. He nearly stole a pass at half court as the clock winded down, but the Celtics were able to hold on for a thrilling 128-126 victory in 3OT. Jo Jo White led both teams in points and assists with 33 and 9 respectively, while Westphal scored 25 for the Suns. After the loss, the Suns were ready to avenge the defeat heading into Game 6 in Phoenix, but a spirited Celtics team sparked a 4th quarter run to win the game 87-80, and the series 4-2. Jo Jo White was named Finals MVP and the Celtics slowly went into a rebuild, eventually winning their 14th championship in 1980. The Suns would not reach the finals again until 1993, by which time Westphal had become their head coach. That season also featured another [heads up play by Westphal](https://new.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9c5h3s/charles_barkley_with_05_seconds_left/), though they would eventually lose to the Bulls in 6. They have not made the finals since.

248	Unpopular opinion from a Warriors fan but I feared CP3 more than Harden in the WCF	"Yeah Harden is an elite 28+ PPG scorer, but I felt CP3s scoring came when the rockets needed a bucket when GS went on a run or if it was s close game down the stretch. I feel Harden doesn't have the stamina to last a full grueling 7 game conference finals series, The first half Harden is lights out, I feel most second halves he just fades away maybe it's due to his playstyle dribbling so many times I don't know. I knew that if CP3 was out for game 6 the series was over because I don't know if Harden is mentally or physically strong enough to get over the final hump, I still would have feared more if Harden went down, because CP3 is obviously not as skilled as Harden but maybe it's his demeanor on the court and I know he would die on the court to get a win those final two games, while I don't think Harden would.

Also I know he choked 2015 but this Houston team is better offensively and defensively than that clippers team.

260	What is your unpopular or controversial opinion relating to the NBA?	"Based on my search it's been 19 days since we had a straightforward unpopular opinion thread, so it's about time for another.  I'm asking for opinions that have been downvoted in other threads, but I ask that you be ready to defend your opinion.  It's no fun if you toss it out there and won't defend it.  And to those of you who disagree, try to refute the central point rather than just ridiculing the opinion or the person expressing the opinion.

I like to see these threads about every two weeks because the nature of Reddit discourages unpopular or controversial opinions, even when they are well reasoned and argued.  So I find these threads an outlet for those opinions.

Of course, because of the nature of Reddit, often the comments that rise to the top are not, in fact, unpopular.  So I suggest sorting by ""controversial"" or ""new"" or, if you sort by""top"" or ""best,"" scroll to the bottom of the list and work your way up.

I'll put my opinions in the comments so you can vote on them.  In this thread, try to resist downvoting opinions because you disagree.  Please reward people who stick around to defend their opinions, and do so well, even if you still disagree with them."	nba

Current DPOY Rudy Gobert highest bpg season is at 2.6, while last year bpg leader is Anthony Davis with 2.57. In fact, last year AD 2.57 bpg is the lowest league leading blocks per game ever recorded.

______________________________________________________

**The average league leading Steals per game is 2.3 in recent years**

Last season spg leader is Oladipo with 2.36, last DPOY to lead to league in spg was Draymond with 2.03

You would think spg is higher but in fact, the last player to hit 2.5 spg mark is CP3 back in 2011-12. The last players to hit 3 spg is Alvin Robertson in 1990-91. Alvin also holds the record of highest spg at 3.7 in a season.

Michael Jordan tie John Stockton with their highest steals per game at 3.2

**Introduction**

The current Basketball Hall of Fame is just that, a hall of fame for anyone who has made a great contribution to the game of basketball. This is not only limited to play on the court in the NBA, but also play in college and internationally, coaching and management at all levels, and media personalities.

This exercise is so that [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) may have its own hall of fame based only on playing accomplishments in the NBA (and ABA in some cases). The goal of this is to have a much more exclusive club of NBA greats. The Basketball Hall of Fame has inductees every year, but the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) hall of fame will have inductees every week this offseason.

**How will it work?**

The first class will be composed of players who retired in 1960 or earlier. The second class will be composed of players who retired 1965 and earlier. The third class will be composed of players who retired 1970 and earlier, and so on.

The players listed must have higher than 20% hall of fame probability according to basketball-reference (just so that the ballots don't become too cluttered).

Each voter will get to choose between 1-5 players who they believe should make the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Any player who gets 50% or more of the vote will be inducted into the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA) Hall of Fame.

Players who receive between 10% and 49.9% of the vote will be eligible in the next class.

Players who receive less than 10% of the vote will move down to the secondary ballot.

The same process is repeated for the secondary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the primary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will move down to the tertiary ballot.

The same process is again repeated for the tertiary ballot. Players who receive 50% or more will move up to the secondary ballot, players who receive 10% to 49.9% will stay, and players who receive less than 10% will be ineligible for all future ballots. Also, players who receive 75% or more will skip the secondary and move straight to the primary ballot. New blood will be brought to this ballot from players who have more than 2% but less than 20% hall of fame probability.

Every other day the ballot will be posted as well as the results from the previous two days.

At the end of each week the inductees, their percentage of the votes, and whether they were first ballot, second ballot, etc will be posted as well as the ballot for the next class."	nba

268	Would this player be considered the GOAT shooter?	"Steph Curry is largely considered the GOAT shooter at this point in time due to his efficiency despite his volume shooting, as well as his ability to create off the dribble.
For his career, he averages 23.1 points on 47.7/43.6/90.3.

However, would a role player that is strictly a catch and shoot player(similar to Kyle Korver) that has awful ball handling on a career splits of 55/50/90 for 15 points a game be considered even better than Curry? Yes, he isn’t going to be the leader of a championship team, but his efficiency would be off the charts and would force a good defender on him at all times."	nba

278	NBA Realignment: 32 teams in 4 conferences	"My idea for NBA realignment is to expand to 32 teams and divide them into four conferences. For the expansion I chose Seattle, which I feel should never have lost their team, and southern coastal Virginia. So the league looks like so:

NORTH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . SOUTH

Minnesotta Timberwolves ......... Oklahoma City Thunder

Milwaulkee Bucks ..................... Dallas Mavericks

Chicago Bulls ........................... San Antonio Spurs

Indiana Pacers .......................... Houston Rockets

Detroit Pistons .......................... Atlanta Hawks

Cleveland Cavaliers ................... Phoenix Suns

Toronto Raptors ........................ Charlotte Hornets

 Memphis Grizzlies ..................... New Orleans Pelicans                      

WEST . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . EAST

Portland Blazers ........................ Boston Celtics

Golden State Warriors .............,,.. NY Knicks

Utah Jazz ...................................  Brooklyn Nets

Denver Nuggets ......................... Philadelphia 76ers

LA Clippers ................................. Washington Wizards 

LA Lakers ................................... Miami Heat    

Seattle Supersonics .................... Orlando Magic

Sacramento Kings ....................... Hampton Roadies 

Twice each season I would have each team play a three game series against every team in their conference. This is a main focus of the realignment: having actual series against conference opponents during the regular season. Teams would also play a 2 game (home and away) series against the teams in one of the other conferences on a rotating basis. 

Against the other 2 conferences teams would only play home OR away and these games would take place in what I am calling a ""schedule smash"". Every team in a conference plays every team in the opposing conference on consecutive nights. So teams play eight games in a row against the entire opposing conference alternating home and away games. 

That's six games against conference opponents, 2 games against the matched conference opponents, and one game against opponents in the other 2 conferences. A team would play 42 conference games and 32 nonconference games for a 74 game season.

I think this schedule has enough games to maintain the current NBA salary structure while at the same time by packing so many nonconference games into short periods of time it leaves most of the season to flow at a more natural pace. No more back to backs. Teams would have days to hold practices and they could use them to game plan against the opponent they were playing a series against. Fans would still get to see the league's stars since teams would be playing in nonconference arenas 2 out of three years. I believe fans will like having the regular season games that look more like the playoffs. Those who enjoy the current haphazard regular season can look forward to the chaos of the schedule smash when teams are just doing their best to adjust on the fly.

294	Is John Wall becoming underrated?	"It looks like John Wall is becoming really underappreciated these last few months. He played only 41 games this season, some of them while being injured, and put up okay stats. 19.4/9.6/3.7. Did he deserve an All-Star? No, in my opinion. Wizards weren't that good, and Beal was the leader of the team for the most of regular season.

But Wall was back for playoffs, and man, he played amazing. Took 2 games from seed 1, and although Toronto disappeared in the next round, they were hitting their shots against Wiz. Wall averaged 26/11.5/5.7. Only 4 players averaged 25/10/5 (Magic, IT, Oscar, Westbrook x2). True, he didn't shoot so well but compared to these players, only Magic and Oscar had better TS than him. He really proved he's back, although the team didn't step up.

What next? Wall is in a very interesting situation. Coming back from serious injury, after his best season, he has a lot to prove. And it looks like the opportunity is there. Wizards have the best team in his career (I know y'all don't like Dwight, but he is replacing Gortat, and Rivers is a really good signing), he looks like he's putting work this offseason. East looks very interesting, and if things work out for Washington, I can see them taking 3rd seed, and maybe finally making a real playoff push. If not, don't be surprised if you see one of their stars on market before the trade deadline."	nba
295	What players in the league are definitely better than Lebron in atleast one aspect of basketball?

296	The last time Brandon Knight was healthy in '16-17, the Suns had a much worse net rating with him on the court (-9.4) than they did this past year with G-League PGs like Shaq Harrison (+13.8), Isaiah Canaan (+10.8), Mike James (+9.5) and even Tyler Ulis (-0.7).	"Not trying to beat a dead horse here, just legitimately curious about the intention behind the Knight acquisition. All signs point to him being one of the worst PGs in the entire league BEFORE tearing his ACL...he's a long way from what he was in Milwaukee.

Here's a chart with the stats I was talking about.



Player | Min | Team Net RTG ON | Team Net RTG OFF | DIFF
------|---|---------------|----------------|----
Knight ('16-17) | 1140 | -12.1 | -2.7 | -9.4
Harrison | 384 | +2.9 | -10.9 | +13.8
Canaan | 418 | 0.0 | -10.8 | +10.8
James | 669 | -1.9 | -11.4 | +9.5
Ulis | 1658 | -10.1 | -9.4 | -0.7

What this chart shows is that while the Suns weren't a ""good"" team starting any of these random nobodies and G-Leaguers throughout the season, with a couple of them they were playing either neutral or even slightly positive basketball on the court. Compare that to Knight and Ulis who significantly dragged the team's rating down throughout the past 2 years.

Keep in mind that in OKC in his scoring peak he averaged 30 points per game on 62% TS.  And this was before the league went pace and space.

Keep in mind in OKC he had terrible spacing. The 2 guards were horrible shooters (Westbrook and Roberson) and the Center also provided zero spacing (Perkins then Adams).  Now imagine if KD played with guys who spaced the floor with him but didn't play with another elite scorer like Curry?

IMO, on a team where he would be the go to scorer and had a couple of elite spot up shooters and a stretch big he would score ridiculous amounts of points.

I think KD could average 35 points per game on 60% TS. Easy.

329	[OC] Collection of Wilt Chamberlain's clutch performances (all playoffs)	"Okay, i always wanted to list some of Wilt's clutch performances (partly to crush the choker myth, and partly because it's fun), and i finally have the time to do it. I'd say that the list's quiet impressive.

Credit goes to dantheman9758 for coming up with many of this before [in one of his forum post.](https://www.basketballforum.com/nba-forum/465788-wilt-chamberlain-would-destroy-todays-nba-6.html#post6753246) This post has more context for his performance though, including some where he choked, how he changed his role between game and game, and what his teammates doing, whether they played well with him or not, and whether Wilt could be blamed for this or not. Also, despite what i implied here, Jerry West couldn't be blamed completely for Wilt's losses because by the time Wilt arrived he already became injury prone, which explain games where he got outplayed or just played poorly.

Overall:

11 game winning shot, 2 in playoffs in recoverable newspapers clip.[ \(according to Dantheman\)](https://www.basketballforum.com/nba-forum/465788-wilt-chamberlain-would-destroy-todays-nba-6.html#post6753246)

Probably only player in NBA history to average at least 20 points and 20 rebounds while shooting at least 60% from the field across Game 7s in the playoffs according to Jaranarm and several forum posts.﻿ I haven't verified it, mainly because i couldn't find the posts anymore (it's all in memory, lol), but Wilt did have two G7 games where he shot at least at 80% (1965 and 1969 vs. Russell). However, with G5 vs Syracuse in 5-game series where he shot 22-48, he definitely didn't shot at that percentage if we also counted G5 in 5-game series.

1962 overall- Major gameplan overhaul that turned Wilt into 'normal' 35 PPG scorer and do other things instead. Warriors went from the worst defensively ([Opponent PPG wisely](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHW/1962.html)) into [second best](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1962.html) at the cost of scoring (second worst now). Gola was hurting in all but G7 ECF, and Arizin was unreliable as second scorer (went 18.2% in G7 vs Boston.) On the other hand, Meschery was on fire, scored 32 points vs Celtics in G7 as a rookie.

G5 1962 first round/ECSF G5- 56 points, 35 rebounds and 12 blocks. The only game in that playoff where Wilt scored more than 50 points, [mainly because his coach only wanted him to score 50 points in that game](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNC6uzGPMAI/VTwgVIhdVvI/AAAAAAAAGJc/5rmjr-Rrfc8/s800-Ic42/NBA%252520EDSF%252520Warrios%252520vs%252520Nationals%252520G5%2525201962%252528better%252520version%252529.jpg). Also, since it was just 5 game series (first team who won 3 games first win the series), this means that Wilt had the most points game in G7 or other series absolute last game equivalent by large margins (vs 47 points by Dom Wilkins and Sam Jones.)

G7 1962 ECF- 22 points and 22 rebounds on 7-15 shooting. Not impressive by his standard, but he shot 8/9 from the freethrow line, [and scored 5 points in 35 seconds in the last minute and nearly sent the game into overtime had Sam Jones didn't hit a miracle shot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/96rsxq/oc_wilt_chamberlains_g7_in_1962_ecf_had_him_only/). Also arguably got screwed by a controversial goaltending against Heinsohn before (according to Wilt's biography by Cherry.) His poor stats also explainable by him played out of pivot in the last three games according to Jaranarm, screwed his high percentages shot and rebounds. Unfortunately unverifiable, but plausible
considering that all of Warriors' starters suddenly got double digits rebounds in [G6.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196204030PHW.html)

G7 1965 ECF vs Boston: [30 points and 32 rebounds with 80% shooting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196504150BOS.html). Nearly won without healthy Luke Jackson (PF starter, only played for 18 minutes that match, replaced by 6-6 forwards who got fouled out). [Also scored 4 clutch points in the last minute and probably scored the last 10-12 points of the match \(according to him and several other 76ers account\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain#Philadelphia_76ers_\(1965%E2%80%931968\)) Wilt considered it as the match where his loser image became widespread instead, and Havlicek stole the show. Had Wilt won the game, the match may would be remembered as Russell's biggest choking moment instead, as he committed turnover with 5 seconds left from a botched inbound pass.

1966 G5: [46 points and 34 rebounds](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196604120PHI.html). However, Wilt screwed team chemistry by not train with his teammates the day before and angered them, which made the rest of them shot below 40%, except Luke Jackson.

1967 overall- Triple Double average against Boston, [two](https://twitter.com/WiltCArchive/status/594194553143480320) [Quadruple Doubles](https://twitter.com/WiltCArchive/status/595996779193176066), 6 blocks in fourth quarter in one of the Finals match (unverifiable). [Also turned Thurmond into unreliable scorer \(34.3% shooting compared to his 55.2% before vs Beaty's Hawks.\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/1967-nba-finals-warriors-vs-76ers.html)

First match vs GSW in Finals: 16 points (4-9ft) 33 rebounds 10 assists 9 blocks. [Wilt blocked Thurmond's layup/hook shot in the last seconds to sent the game into overtime.](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KRNKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gYUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=allintext:+wilt+chamberlain+blocked+shots&amp;pg=1543,4981995&amp;hl=en)

1968 ECF: Not good performance by Wilt (blew up 3-1 lead), [thanks to injuries by many players, including Wilt](http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19671968.html). [Wilt had a very bad shooting night in G6](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196804170BOS.html), and only got 23 offensive touches in G7, just two in fourth quarter, probably due to his bad night before.

1969 Finals: Wilt unarguably choked throughout the series, but he [managed to step up in G7](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196905050LAL.html), scored 18 points on 7-8 shooting, with 27 rebounds. Breyda Koff screwed up by took him off when he sprained his ankle just to spite at him and proved that he didn't need big center to win. Real tragic hero was Jerry West though, the first and only Finals MVP from losing team with 42 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, played with injured hamstring.

1970 overall- In a herculean effort, Wilt overcame a big injury (ruptured patellar tendon) and returned just before the playoff, [scored 23 Points and 24 rebounds on 62.5% shooting against Willis Reed in the Finals.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1970-nba-finals-lakers-vs-knicks.html) The same injury took Jeremy Lin and
Roberson off the season, decades after advancements of medicine and surgery. Wilt wasn't playing at his best in G7 though, but the whole Lakers were outplayed by Knicks, especially West who got torched by Frazier with 36 points and 19 assists on 70.6% shooting. West was playing with injured shooting hand in G7 however.

[1971 G7 WCS vs Bulls](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197104060LAL.html): 25 points after spent the last four matches as low-scoring defensive player, won the series without injured Baylor and West. [He went to averaged 22 points vs Kareem in next series](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1971-nba-western-conference-finals-lakers-vs-bucks.html), higher than his 20.7 regular season average.

1972 overall- [Wilt scored 10.8 PPG vs Kareem,](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1972-nba-western-conference-finals-bucks-vs-lakers.html) and [19.4 PPG vs Knicks \(no Willis Reed\)](https://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/1972-nba-finals-knicks-vs-lakers.html). In both series, Wilt was showered by praises, despite much worse shooting vs Kareem (45.2%). Probably best example that Wilt's a reliable performer in playoffs regardless of stats and style of play.

1972 G6 WCF vs. Bucks- Wilt scored 20 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in 66.7% shooting after spent the last five games as 9 PPG defender. Rallied Lakers to won the game and overcame a 10 points deficit in 4th quarter, and outsprinted Kareem in fastbreaks. Jerry West called it as the greatest ball-busting performance he has ever seen.

1972 G4 Finals vs Knicks- Two blocks in OT, played aggressive defense with 5 fouls, shattered myth of him played too carefully when he got 5 fouls (probably still valid criticism in Reg. season, although his 2.0 fouls average made those matches very rare in the first place).

1972 G5 vs Knicks. Chamberlain with 24 points, on 10-14 shooting, with 29 rebounds, 4 assists, and 9 blocks. Finals MVP with broken hand. He won with Jerry West having subpar shooting performance, never shot above 40% in any match vs Knicks. Unlike other poor performances listed in this post, West just flat out admitted that he played a terrible series, despite his 8.8 assists average.

1973 WCS Game 7 vs Chicago Bulls: Wilt get 21pts and 28rbs. He also blocked a shot with 30 seconds left and threw a full court pass to Goodrich, who scored and give a lead for Lakers for the first time in second half.

1973 G5 Finals vs Knicks: Wilt scored 23 points and grabbed 21 rebounds, but lost the Finals thanks to subpar performance by West and Hairston, who were injured.

330	How important is mental fatigue?	"The Warriors still seem like the team to beat heading into the 2019 season. But the core of the team (besides Durant and Boogie) have gone to 4 straight finals and might be headed to their fifth. 

How much do you think mental fatigue will impact their play this season? Can they be upset by the Rockets or Jazz? 

Bonus Question: In the MJ documentary ""His Airness"" Jordan said he didn't have that same motivation or ""fire"" after his first threepeat. Could Phil Jackson have found a way to motivate him and maybe win 8 straight if Jordan had not retired?"	nba

**76ers vs Bucks** we got young International Stars going against each other! Simmons of Aus, Embiid of Cameroon, Saric of Croatia, Giannis of Greece, Ersan Illyasova of Turkey, Furkan Korkmaz of Turkey...

Any combo from OKC, Houston and Denver would be so fun

**OKC vs Nuggets** regular season game in Feb 2018 at Denver was prolly one of the better games last season, that ended with Gary Harris buzzer beating game winner, Jamal Murray and Jokic went off, Russ had like 20 assists and PG13 got 40 something points. Love to see this 7 game series

**OKC vs Rockets** bc Melo; the PnR dynamic of Russ and Adams vs Harden and Capela; a classic rematch from 2017 Playoffs

**Rockets vs Nuggets** also fun bc Melo, here's a fun fact: Melo has not been able to win a single game in Denver ever since he demanded a trade from Denver. 

**Spurs vs Lakers** classic LeBron vs Popovich, 2 basketball masterminds, DeMar been beaten by LeBron for what seems to be his entire Playoff careers now got traded to a new place, with lots to prove, I hope he can reach new heights within Pop system to beat LeBron, or at least put up a fight.

344	The recency bias concerning Durant vs Kobe is insane.	"Prime Kobe destroys Durant as a ball-handler/passer/play-maker. The recency bias around here is insane. Did everyone forget how awful and uncomfortable Durant looked in the 13/14/16 post-seasons whenever he was asked to handle the ball and create as the lead guy?  He's hidden this narrative being on a team where he doesn't need to do that. 

Seriously, there's a reason that prime Kobe beats Durant in EVERY impact metric we have available (RAPM, CORP, On/Off, WOWY) despite Durant's superiority in the box-score. No, Durant hasn't surpassed Kobe yet. The fact that such a consensus believes that he has, IMO, is a symptom of how over-reliant we have become on individual scoring efficiency as a measure of player performance. Individual scoring efficiency is important, and to be as absurdly efficient as Durant at such a high volume is more impressive still. But there are other aspects to the game, and I don't think they're given enough weight in many of the discussions here.



Part of the reason that individual scoring efficiency is so focused upon is that every ""advanced"" box score metric relies heavily on it. But since they have different names, people often site them as if they are giving different results. For example, Durant's advantages in TS%, PER, Offensive Rating and Win Shares all tie strongly to Durant's scoring efficiency advantage. Thus, citing each of them individually doesn't strengthen the case much IMO, since it's repetitive."	nba

351	Top 20 career VORPs under 60, inactive players not yet in HoF: 1.S. Marion, 2.L. Nance, 3.B. Wallace, 4.C. Webber, 5.V. Divac	"I kept VORP under 60 to knock out Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, and Paul Pierce, recently-retired stars who are shoo-ins for the Hall of Fame when they become eligible.  Shawn Marion is likely going into the Hall of Fame as well, but I still think of him as a role player.  

I actually think of Ben Wallace as the best player on his team, but defensive stars are ordinarily considered role players, even on a team that won with defense.  Larry Nance, Sr. was usually the best player on his team, but he's been eligible for the Hall of Fame for a long time without making it.  

Horace Grant is my favorite on this list simply because he's a former Bull, and I consider him very underrated.  I never heard of Alvan Adams before I made this list.  I must have missed him because I was more of a Eastern Conference fan in the 1980s.

VORP is a box score estimate of the points per 100 TEAM possessions that a player contributed above a replacement-level (-2.0 BPM) player, translated to an average team and prorated over an 82-game season.  Multiply by 2.7 to convert to wins over replacement.  

BPM and VORP can only be calculated going back to 1973-74, based on the statistics in the NBA box score.  It's an attempt to simulate more advanced stats that cannot be calculated going back more than a few years.  [Here's an article on BPM and VORP.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html)

352	It seems like a large part of the reason Bill and Wilt are highly rated is because they were tremendously athletic and therefore people believe they would be successful in any era ...	"Yet there are plenty of tremendously athletic players who are not successful in the modern NBA. 

Now you could say ""Wilt and Bill weren't just tremendously athletic, they were among the best athletes ever"" to which I would say that players today are on average more athletic than their predecessors *even accounting for their medical, training and equipment advantages*, largely due to the deeper talent pool and greater financial incentives. 

If Wilt and Bill had a 20% athletic advantage over their contemporaries and it drops to 10% in the modern era it is possible that their athletic advantage is no longer enough to overwhelm opponents.

Don't get me wrong now, Magic has done 100000x more than simmons and is far better in ""HIS"" era than Simmons. But Simmons is just far more athletic, Magic is a better passer but I just don't see him being a superstar in this era. He's not a freak athlete and he can't shoot. In his era he had athletic advantages but in this era he wont'. Bird wouldn't be as good as Durant in this era but he'd still be an absolute superstar."	nba

Just thought I'd share an incredible non-cherry picked stat to illustrate the greatness of Joe Ingles. His raw numbers for his career don't pop out to you but he has some of the best advanced stats that really fly under the radar. This in particular illustrates his diverse skill set and how well he plays as a support player.  
  
Adding on to that where does Joe Ingles rank in the NBA?  
  
In 2016-17 he averaged 7/3/3 on 45/41/74 shooting and during the offseason he was ranked the following in top 100 lists.  
-Unranked by ESPN and Sports Illustrated  
-94th by the Washington Post  
-84th by Yahoo  
-64th by Bleacher Report  
  
This year he improved completely posting career highs in almost every stat and averaging 12/4/5 on 47/44/80 shooting (2.5 threes per game). He also continued his form into the playoffs where he averaged 15/4/3 on 47/46/65 shooting with 3.2 threes per game. Joe isn't just an ordinary 3&amp;D player and what sets him apart is his playmaking skills including averaging 6.4 assists per game post all star break and 7.0 for his last 20 regular season matches.  
  
Where do you rank him in the entire overall and for his position."	nba
364	How good is Jason Tatum?	The Celtics are my second favorite team and I like Tatum, but don’t get the hype. Yes he makes plays and showed out in the playoffs, but everyone is acting like he’s gonna be a superstar in the NBA. While that could be true as crazier things have happened, if I’m building for the future there are many other young guys I would rather have in my organization. Honestly, in the superstar era we are in today with championship teams needing a player like Lebron, KD, or Steph, i am very concerned as a Celtics fan, because I honestly see Tatums ceiling being a prime Paul George type player, which is fine, but not going to win, especially when in a Division with the sixers, who happen to have 2 young players with clear mvp ceilings, and another one with legit all star potential and draws comparisons to James Harden. The sad part is that my Celtics are in their window right now(emerging young player with great vets), but unfortunately in two years when the warriors finally decline, it will be too late for Boston to win. 	nba

367	Dwight Howard 10-Second Free Throw Violation &amp; Technical - While Paul Pierce Counts With His Fingers		nba
368	Which NBA personnas match the Greek Gods?	"The Olympians were the chlidren of Cronus and Rhea: Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter and Hera plus the children of Zeus: Athena, Aphrpdite, Artemis, Ares, Apollo, Hephaistus, Hermes and Dionysus. They are 13 because there is a version that leaves Hestia out and a version that leaves Dionysus out (the Gods had to be 12 because they were counting in dozenal). I'll also add Hades even though he was not an Olympian he is one of the ""big 3"" (Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) that overthrew the Titans (who were the older generation of gods).

I'll focus on active or recently retired players / coaches.

**Zeus**, the youngest son of Cronus and Rhea was God of the sky and thunder. He was also the king of the gods and the god of justice. He was considered the ultimate god in terms of both power and wisdom. As such, it is only fitting to match him with **LeBron James**. Their big difference was that Zeus was a big womanizer unlike LeBron. LeBron only drops his towel in front of his wife and Lue.

**Poseidon**  was God of the sea and natural disasters like storms and earthquakes. He was extremely powerful and had a temper. Noone wanted to see his bad side as he'd become very hard to calm down once angered and wasn't the compromising type. As such, I'll say he is **Kobe Bryant**.

**Hades** was God of the underworld and the earth, night and dreams. He was the quiet type that took the job noone of the cool guys in Olympus wanted, to rule over the underworld. He was very bored with his dull job and was known to pose interesting challenges to visitors of the underworld to entertain himself. I think the one matching this description would be **Tim Duncan** as he was known to be timid but secretly playful.

**Hera** was the Goddess of marriage and family. She was married to Zeus and was loyal to him even though he cheated on her all the time. She was very jealous and punished all the lovers of Zeus. She blessed happy married couples and punished infidelity. I'd say the player that matches is **Russel Westbrook** as he was always loyal to the Thunder but he now is trying to punish KD for betraying their family.

**Demeter** was the Goddess of agriculture, the circle of life and morality. Demeter was serene. Her daughter by Zeus, Persephone was abducted by and married to Hades and became Queen of the Underworld. However, Demeter convinced Hades to let her daughter spend half the year in the overworld thus creating the cycle of the seasons. I'd say it's **Gregg Popovich** that had created a situation of permanent fertility but Kawhi left and soon the Spurs will probably have to go through the cycle of tanking.

**Hestia** was the Goddess of home, hearth and order in both family and the state. She was the eldest and most peaceful of all the gods and she only provides humans the comfort and blessing of home. She never gets confrontational and never judges or delivers punishment. She is the one who receives the offerings to the gods. I'd say Hestia is the perhaps most peaceful and loveable NBA personna, **Dirk Nowitzki**.

**Athena** was born out of Zeus' head and was the Goddess of wisdom, logic and strategy. She was one of the most loved and respected gods (hence, Athens is named after her) and in most myths was the goddess who helped the ""hero"". She also got involved in human affairs a lot, providing guidance. Athena was generally serious but she wouldn't back down from challenges. I'd say Athena is **Brad Stevens**  trying to guide the young Celtics towards contention.

**Apollo** was the God of the sun, light, knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, health and disease. Apollo was also considered an extremely important god next to Athena. His personality was very complex and his behaviour unpredictable. He often provided all kinds blessings and gave all kinds of curses. I think **Kahwi Leonard** is NBA's Apollo. Can be a game changer but can also make everything crumble. Noone knows exactly what he is thinking.

**Ares** was the God of war and violence. He represented our brutal instincts to dominate by force and is the god most hated by Zeus and most feared by humans. In most myths he is on the losing side and defeated by Athena's side (as strategy &gt; brute force) who likes to make fun of him and he hates her for that. Since Brad Stevens is Athena I think the most fit to be Ares would be **Joel Embiid** because of this year's playoffs. It could also have been Giannis but I think Embiid fits better as he is much more of a trash talker than Giannis.

**Aphrodite** was the Goddess of love, sexuality, lust, allure and persuasion.  Every human that laid eyes on her would see her in the form of the ideal woman of his fantsasies. Anyone she touched (including Gods) would fall in love with her. She oversees all forms of sexual relationships from pure innocent love to prostitution. She was quite mischievous. Aphrodite is thus **Stephen Curry** cause he is the ideal fit to any team and attracts superstars like a magnet.

**Hephaistus** is the God of fire, volcanos and also god of blacksmiths and craftsmen of any kind. He was worshipped especially in Athens that was very industrialized. He is rather plain and rough looking while all of his brothers are very handsome. He also has the least women affairs. However, he is the one married to Aphrodite (though Aphrodite has way more affairs, most notably with Ares). Hephaistus forged all the weapons of the Gods in his workshop. He was quiet and focused on his craft. I'd say he is the one that matches **Klay Thompson** the most.

**Artemis** was the Goddess of the moon, the forest and wilderness, the hunt, archery and virginity. Artemis was the wild beauty, the maiden of the Gods. Artemis was fierce, honest and pure. I'm between Giannis and AD but since the animal most associated with Artemis is the deer it has to be **Giannis**. Unlike Artemis, though, Giannis likes to foreplay at night.

**Hermes** was the God of messengers, travelers, merchants, thieves and games/sports. He was also the guide to the underworld. In ancient Greece, being messenger was one of the most honorable proffessions and messengers would be invited in the houses of the rich to tell their stories, hence the messenger of the Gods is an Olympian God himself and not just a henchman. Hermes was also the most cunning God (he was basically associated with what we call ""street smarts"") and would sometimes trick other Gods since he had control over all information. Obviously, the Hermes of the NBA is **Adrian Wojnarowski**.

**Dionysus** was the God of party, wine, ecstacy, euphoria, ritualistic madness and theatre. He was always accompanied by exotic animals and there is always an endless party around him. The dionysian rituals involved drinking and dancing till your mind lost all fear and care. There were also several cult clubs themed around Dionysus with a wide variety of rituals. Dionysus was basically the God of being high. Since Michael Beasley has wisened up, he can only be **J.R. Smith**."	nba
369	In his last 41 regular season games of the 2017-18 season, Dario Šarić averaged 15.5 PPG, 6.4 RPG and 2.6 APG with a TS% of 60.6% in only 28.8 MPG	"He also continued his form into the postseason, averaging 17.2 PPG, 7.3 RPG and 3.5 APG on a TS% of 54.6% (sizably above average in the postseason) in 32.9 MPG. He was arguably the best player for Philadelphia in the series against Boston which while was only 5 games, had mostly close games throughout.

He has played very well over his last 50 games, and is only 23 years old, which still leaves a lot of time for him to develop, especially considering the large leap he made from his first to 2nd season, especially in 3-point shooting where he went from 31.1% on 4.2 attempts per game to 39.3% on 5.1 attempts per game.

I believe that Šarić is among the most underrated players in the entire NBA currently and will become even better in the next few seasons when he is able to get more playing time and play a bigger role within the team. He definitely deserves more recognition and should be easily considered as a top 10 power forward in the league with room for improvement."	nba

374	Context vs Statistics	"Over the last week we've had daily posts that consider KD a better player than Kobe.  Allen Iverson overrated.  One comparing Giannis with LeBron at his age, and saying Giannis is better, purely based on the stat comparisons.  

There's no excuse for not going back and watching games/series of players from the 2k eras, just because Giannis has similar stats that LeBron averaged at his age, LeBron had already been to the finals and conference finals.  He's not better because he's more efficient.  Kevin Durant is *not* close to a better player than Kobe as far as careers go at this point.  Allen Iverson wasn't an overrated loser.  

Go back and watch some playoff series, they're readily available, and ones after 2006/7 are even in full HD.  Go watch how those eras played with 1 on 1 defense and iso heavy scoring.  Go watch the gravity a guy like LeBron brought to the floor, go watch how Kobe demanded a double team whenever he was hot.  Now go watch Giannis/KD in the switch friendly era.  

There's an excuse for not watching Wilt or Russell, it's not available.  The game quality of Magic/Bird is pretty shitty because the league may not have film to remaster into HD/4k.  But Kobe?  LeBron?  Not hard to do.

381	Steph Curry goes 5/5 from 3 in the 4th after Kendrick Perkins kerfuffle	"[SKYFUCKED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmgdJe7LFVM)

Steph Curry was walking backwards along the sideline when an oversized, overpaid, useless Cavs player named Kendrick Perkins appeared, with his oversized, overpaid, useless knees in the way. After bumping into him, Curry turned around to ask him politely to get the fuck out of the way, as Perkins stood up and attempted to come up with a valid reason for why he still hasn't received a Cavaliers Jersey. After getting in each other's face for a brief moment, Curry asked him ""Waddup big fella?"" and Perkins was lost for words, staring intensely as he often does.



No technicals or other violations were assessed (good work refs) and Curry went on to end the game almost single-handedly with 5 3's including 1 shot clock buzzer-beating, hail mary moonshot over Kevin Love, and a 4 point play in the corner... again over Kevin Love.  Curry finished with 9 3's on 17 attempts, breaking a record set by Ray Allen in Game 2 vs. the Lakers in 2010. Kendrick Perkins is looking to set his own record of most team games attended in a suit, but Derrick Rose still maintains a sizeable lead.

Lakers fans are left puzzled at the end of this confrontation, wondering how Larry Nance Jr. is sitting on the ground for stretches of the game, while a cheerleader is given a seat with the active players."	nba

&amp;nbsp;

You might remember [Joe Harris winning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/83igu9/the_201718_most_average_nba_player_award_goes_to/) the elusive 2017-18 Most Average Player award earlier this year. To become eligible for adding that trophy to his display case, Harris had to fulfill a wide array of statistical, analytical and eye-test requirements. The same formula will now be applied to determine who the most mediocre players are at their respective positions.

This is now the fourth year since the inception of the Most Average Lineup award. The selection process remained identical during that entire span, and since the method yielded pretty consistent results in terms of pure numbers so far, it shall remain unchanged in this rendition as well.

The first step of the process is determining the average values for five main statistical categories by using the median function on the [ESPN’s leaderboard](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics) featuring players who participated in 70% of available games. Of course, unlike in Harris’ case when the analysis was based on the pool containing all qualified NBA players, five different leaderboards for five different positions will be used. The average values established using that procedure will provide the initial framework, or rather the prototype of the average player for each position.

The next step is finding players who are the closest to fitting into the average player mold. Once the best available candidates are found, they will be compared in terms of advanced stats and the eye-test, where having no extraordinary characteristics is positively valued.

Here are the last season’s most average players for each position, along with the data for previous seasons.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **De’Aaron Fox, Ish Smith**

Both the Kings’ rookie point guard and the Pistons’ established veteran came incredibly close to the perfect average point guard in terms of basic stats. Fox and Smith posted the exact required assist average, and the deviations in terms of points and rebounds were minimal, with Smith gaining a slight advantage.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ish+Smith&amp;player_id1_select=Ish+Smith&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=smithis01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=De%27Aaron+Fox&amp;player_id2_select=De%27Aaron+Fox&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=foxde01&amp;idx=players)

Since that tiny advantage could not be considered the decisive factor, their respective Player Efficiency Rating for the previous season was consulted. For those who are not aware, PER is calibrated each season so that its average value is precisely 15.0.

Considering that Smith’s PER of 15.4 is much closer to the average threshold than Fox’s 11.2, it becomes clear that the 8-year veteran has a significantly better case for the label of the average point guard. Even common sense supports that decision, since Fox was still a rookie last season and wasn’t able to play fully to his strengths yet, while Smith is a 30-year old who has been considered a solid sixth/seventh man material throughout his whole career, which is exactly what is required in this context.

The 2017-18 Average Point Guard: **Ish Smith**

[Image of the table](https://imgur.com/gdq0bEh) for mobile users.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Tyler Johnson, Courtney Lee, Marco Belinelli**

The average shooting guard has apparently evolved into a more proficient scorer than in the past years, and the three final candidates reflect that. Johnson and Belinelli are known as strong, albeit streaky scorers, and Lee, who was *the* average shooting guard two years ago, has always been a reliable 3-and-D option.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Tyler+Johnson&amp;player_id1_select=Tyler+Johnson&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=johnsty01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Courtney+Lee&amp;player_id2_select=Courtney+Lee&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=leeco01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Marco+Belinelli&amp;player_id3_select=Marco+Belinelli&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=belinma01&amp;idx=players)

In terms of basic stats, all three would be a justified selection for the middle-of-the-pack shooting guard. Not even PER helps break the three-way tie, since all three guys were pretty much identical in terms of efficiency last season. Looking at the Box Plus/Minus, however, shows that while Lee and Belinelli were net positives on offense and negatives on defense, Johnson was average at both ends of the floor.

Finally, other than perhaps his athleticism, Johnson doesn’t really stand out on the field in any other aspect. He doesn’t particularly hurt the Heat chances of winning on any given night, but is also not that impactful of a factor on the court. The only thing that could bother the Heat fans in this case is the fact that their front office is paying $19 million for nothing more than an average shooting guard.

The 2017-18 Average Shooting Guard: **Tyler Johnson**

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Dillon Brooks, Mario Hezonja, Jeff Green, Jae Crowder**

There has been plenty of small forwards last season who neither thrilled their respective fanbases nor overly disappointed them. The two young guns, Brooks and Hezonja, had relatively promising, but not particularly strong years, while the two veterans, who were both on the Cavaliers roster at the start of the season, had pretty mediocre years – at least within the context of their careers.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Dillon+Brooks&amp;player_id1_select=Dillon+Brooks&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=brookdi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Mario+Hezonja&amp;player_id2_select=Mario+Hezonja&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=hezonma01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Jeff+Green&amp;player_id3_select=Jeff+Green&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=greenje02&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Jae+Crowder&amp;player_id4_select=Jae+Crowder&amp;y4=2018&amp;player_id4=crowdja01&amp;idx=players)

While the basic statlines of the entire quartet support their candidacy for the average small forward, advanced parameters don’t favor two of the four players. Both Brooks, who was a rookie, and Crowder, who switched teams mid-season, were too far removed from the average values in terms of PER and BPM to be considered as valid average small forwards.

Among the remaining two candidates, the PER definitely favors Green, who finished the season with an efficiency rating of 14.8. Hezonja is, however, much closer to the typical small forward in terms of BPM, and also gains an edge in all the basic categories. Furthermore, Hezonja spent more time at the small forward position than Green who often filled in as a power forward, thus making Hezonja a clear-cut option for receiving the most average SF ribbon.

[Image of the table](https://imgur.com/Tq9l1ZE) for mobile users.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Ersan Ilyasova, Trey Lyles, Marvin Williams**

Ilyasova, Lyles and Williams are the three players who are the most viable options for getting their first most average team selections. In this case, the basic stats clearly favor Ilyasova, since he is the closest to fitting the mold of the average power forward in terms of points, rebounds *and* assists.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Ersan+Ilyasova&amp;player_id1_select=Ersan+Ilyasova&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=ilyaser01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Trey+Lyles&amp;player_id2_select=Trey+Lyles&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=lylestr01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Marvin+Williams&amp;player_id3_select=Marvin+Williams&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=willima02&amp;idx=players)

The next step, i.e. analysis of advanced stats, also strongly suggests that Ilyasova is the perfect choice for the title of the most average power forward. His PER of 14.6 and BPM of 0.1 are extremely close to the league-wide average values, which, coupled with his advantage in the basic stats department, puts him clearly ahead of the Hornets’ and the Nuggets’ big men.

After all, utilizing bigs who can stretch the floor with their soft touch, rather than fielding physical forwards who mostly reside in the paint, has recently become one of the most prominent trends, and Ilyasova as the average power forward clearly reflects that trend.

The 2017-18 Average Power Forward: **Ersan Ilyasova**

[Image of the table](https://imgur.com/0smX0nL) for mobile users.

&amp;nbsp;

The nominees: **Larry Nance Jr., Jarrett Allen, John Henson, Dwight Powell**

After being titled the average center for two out of past three season, Robin Lopez is finally not even in the race this season. There are, however, four centers who may be considered average, at least in terms of their baseline numbers. At a first glance, neither of the four had a particularly outstanding season.

[Link to Basketball Reference player comparison page.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Larry+Nance+Jr.&amp;player_id1_select=Larry+Nance+Jr.&amp;y1=2018&amp;player_id1=nancela02&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Jarrett+Allen&amp;player_id2_select=Jarrett+Allen&amp;y2=2018&amp;player_id2=allenja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=John+Henson&amp;player_id3_select=John+Henson&amp;y3=2018&amp;player_id3=hensojo01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Dwight+Powell&amp;player_id4_select=Dwight+Powell&amp;y4=2018&amp;player_id4=poweldw01&amp;idx=players)

Comparing their average stats to the stats of the average center, it seems as though Nance Jr. and Powell have the best case for getting away with it this season. Surprisingly though, both were far from being mediocre this season, at least from an advanced analytics standpoint. Powell and Nance Jr. posted a PER of 18.8 and 20.2 respectively, which put them both in the [Top 50](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=bdOlH) players of the last season according to that metric.

With Allen and Henson, the situation was much closer, but Henson was more convincing in converging towards an average center in all categories than Allen was. Again, Henson seems like a solid choice since he was not a player who either greatly influenced the Bucks’ chances in a positive or a negative manner last season. He scored around the rim at a respectable clip, grabbed some rebounds, blocked some shots; exactly what you would expect from a center that is not a franchise player.

The 2017-18 Average Center: **John Henson**

---

**Smith, Johnson, Hezonja, Ilyasova, Henson** – this lineup definitely doesn’t ooze greatness; if we’re being honest, that starting five is sentenced to a tanking season from its very beginning. In a league that is so evidently driven by starpower, a team exclusively made up of average players is bound for failure, which is the likely destiny of this group.

Keep in mind, this team represents the average of all players in the league, not just the starters. Expecting a lineup composed of worst starters / best sixth men of their respective teams to consistently perform at the highest level would not be a smart move in the first place.

However, if you add two or three stars to that team, they suddenly don’t look to shabby. Guys who know their roles and offer a balanced brand of offense and defense would provide a respectable support for the centerpieces carrying the team.

While the average players might be considered the foundation of the league, the stars are what the ultimate success of a team depends on. There have been just a few exceptions to that rule throughout NBA history, and this objectively unimpressive 1st All-NBA Average Team further confirms that.

3. https://imgur.com/nYUBTzv This is the first frame where we see Andre Miller. The ball is a little over halfway to the destination and Andre Miller just crossed the half court line. Kobe hasn't even reached the 3-point line yet.

4. https://imgur.com/7nzjQCD This is the last frame we see Kobe in the picture. He's at the very back, still pretty far away from the half court line. Andre Miller is nearing the 3-point line and the ball is close to his hands. Looks like an easy layup at this point.

5. https://imgur.com/ZZTEpzm This is the final frame we get from this angle. Kobe is not in the picture, Miller has the ball, and he's about 2 steps away from the uncontested layup. How he doesn't make this, I don't know.

6. https://imgur.com/8FaAJPo This is from the replay, which is a about 0.5 seconds behind the last picture. Here we see Andre Miller with the ball inside the 3-point line. Kobe has still not crossed the half court line.

7. https://imgur.com/1EeUo54 A few seconds later and all of a sudden this looks like he actually might be able to block it. This is the first frame where a block looks somewhat realistic. Kobe just crossing the free throw line and Andre Miller has just gone up for the layup.

8. https://imgur.com/k52galv The block.


----

This is a pretty crazy chase-down block. One of my favorites. It really doesn't make much sense how Kobe actually blocked it, but he somehow did.

Lakers were up 17 with 6 minutes left in the 4th when this block happened - the game was over. There was really no reason to put that much effort for the chase down block, but Kobe did.

393	Who are some slept on players who you believe could become All-Stars at least once?	"I've always believed that Tim Hardaway Jr has had potential to be one of the most well rounded players in the league. It seems to be all about consistency with him. When he's hot, it's almost impossible to stop him. Another guy that I believe shows a lot of promise is Jamal Murray. Not only is he a good outside shooter. He has underrated athleticism and above all else, viciousness. He comes out on the court not only wanting to win, but to embarrass you as well.

So as u can see, in the context of his team, he did what he had to do.  It wouldve been nice had he made more of his shots, but no reasonable person would suggest that any one of the other guys was capable of carrying even a decent portion of the shooting workload at a good efficiency.

421	Comparing Kevin Durant's scoring from ages 21-30 to other superstars	"This in reference to this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9c80k3/kevin_durant_since_age_21_9_seasons_has_averaged/

The post compares Durant's scoring numbers in his first nine seasons, which happens to be from when he was 21 until now, when he's 29.

I didn't think it was a very fair comparison considering it included Jordan's, Kobe's, and LeBron's numbers past their 9th season. Not only is that fair in the case of Jordan because it includes his 35 year season, those players also end up having a much larger sample size than Durant - and that point was sort of missed.

So here are all four again, this time using each of their first nine seasons from when the age of 21.

---

Kevin Durant **(2010-2018)**: 28.2 pts on 62.5% TS

Kobe Bryant **(2000-2008)**: 28.3 pts on 55.6% TS

LeBron James **(2006-2014)**: 28.3 pts on 59.4% TS

Michael Jordan **(1985-1993)**: 32.3 pts on 58.9% TS

---

I also thought it would be worth it to compare their post-season numbers using the same criteria. Since Durant has been in eight post-seasons, that's the number we'll use for all players.

I was looking at some of his clutch time stats and it was actually [pretty ridiculous](https://mobile.twitter.com/ESPNNBA/status/836342916591333376/photo/1). He also lead the league in almost [every clutch time stat](https://mobile.twitter.com/royceyoung/status/849825850249949184). That year was one of the biggest carry jobs ever. Averaged 31.2 pts a game while averaging a triple double on league efficiency on around 55% TS if I’m not mistaken. Single handily won a bunch of games like the Memphis, Orlando, Nuggets, Rockets(poster on capela) just to name a few.

426	Thanos Snaps the NBA: The Los Angeles Lakers	"Again, to clarify my methods. There is a 50% chance that a player will be snapped (killed) by Thanos. This time I used random.org to determine if a player survived.

Snapped: Luol Deng, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Moritz Wagner, JaVale McGee, Travis Wear, Joel Berry II, Jeffrey Carroll

Survivors: Michael Beasley, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Isaac Bonga, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, LeBron James, Lance Stephenson, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, Alex Caruso, Jonathan Williams, Ivica Zubac


Well fuck. I guess the Lakers are going to win. That is still an incredibly solid starting 5. Yes, the team doesn't have a good center, but I think Lebron, Kuzma, and Stephenson could all handle a small lineup, especially in a league full of snapped centers. This is an incredibly deep post-snap team. The biggest loss to this team is meme potential, but they still have Stephenson, so they even keep some of that. This team might legitimately be better than last year's Cavs team. Thanos was no match for LeThanos. At least Lonzo died.

"Had a debate at the barbershop about the Lakers retiring Lebron's number.The Majority of the people said theres nothing LeBron could do to get his number retired by the lakers because he'll only be there for a short time. But heres my point:

Even tho he'll only be in LA for at Least 4 years,  IF (big if) he brings at least 2 Championship to the Lakers, he'll probably get his number retired by them. Wilt was in LA for only 5 years with 1 chip and got his number retired so why can't LeBron do the same? Whats your guys opinion?"	nba

439	Mats Wermelin: The Greatest Basketball Player That Never Played	"According to the 1985-86 edition of Guiness World Records ([as quoted by the L.A. Times](http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-04/sports/sp-9228_1_cold-fish)), a 13 Swedish boy named Mats Wermelin scored 272 points in a basketball game in February 5, 1974. That alone is insane, but it's also worth mentioning the final score was 272 points.

He scored all 272 points. The other team scored none. 272 points. None. The kid was 13 years old.

At first glance it seems we have the GOAT, perhaps surpassing MJ, LeBron, Kobe, and more if he kept it up and joined the big leagues. We could only imagine how many championships he would have won.

But let's take a closer look at this. There's unfortunately no video showcasing Mats' apparently legendary display. I decided to do some digging. I found [this article](http://www.fiba.basketball/news/-hoop-dreams-some-stories-you-might-have-missed) from FIBA discussing the matter (fifth paragraph). Funnily enough it mentions Mats actually scored 232 points, but still claims the other team scored zero points. 

FIBA, if you don't know, is the official governing body of basketball. Basically it's FIFA, but basketball. They have World Cups and sanction basketball in the Summer Olympics. 

To me the official website of the governing body of a sport would be a very reliable source. Though the point difference is odd. Everywhere else it says he scored 272. Weird. 

When you look up Mats Wermelin it comes up with images of [this guy](http://shipmanagementinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mats-Wermelin.jpg). According to his [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mats-wermelin-01309b1b), he's a member of DNB, a banking company headquarted in Norway. Various sources give different locations for what part of the world Mats works for. I bet we could access more information, like his age, on his Linkedin page, but it requires you to sign up, and yeah, I'm not signing up for something I'm going to use one time and never again. I don't really think this is our guy anyway. 

Okay, so, why am I making this? [Someone already made a reddit post about this as early as a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6wzvhi/in_1974_13yr_old_mats_wermelin_scored_272_points/).

Well, it's simple really. This whole thing seems...incomplete, I guess. I just feel there's several pieces to this story we're missing. I wouldn't really find the story that hard to believe (even though the part about the other team scoring nothing seems unlikely), but there's not a lot of information online about this. 

I need your help, is what I'm saying. This is a mystery waiting to be solved. The mystery of who Mats Wermelin is, if he really scored 272 points at the age of 13, if the other team didn't score at all, why didn't he continue playing basketball. If you find anything, please let me know in the comments. Thanks.

445	Who's the better basketball player? Kevin Durant or prime Larry Bird?	"*Note: This is not a comparison of their careers. Obviously Larry had a better career than current KD.*

---
Let's look at their best seasons per 100 possessions:

* **1985 Larry Bird**: 34/13/8 on 52/43/88 shooting splits (59 TS%)

* **2014 Kevin Durant**: 42/10/7 on 50/39/87 shooting splits (64 TS%)

Advanced stat comparison: Both players lead the league in PER, VORP, and win shares. Larry also lead the league in BPM, while KD was 2nd behind Lebron. However KD lead the league in scoring, something Bird has surprisingly never done. 

* PER: Durant

* W/S 48: Durant

* VORP: Tie

* BPM: Tie

---

There are lots of things to consider here. For example, style of play. 

Would Larry have taken more threes in this era and increased his TS% and scoring output? 

Would KD be able to get to rim and lead the league in free throws in an era where you could chokeslam drivers out of the air? 

How would Larry match up against today's athletes? 

Just looking at the numbers KD seems better. I didn't actually watch Larry play other than on youtube, so i don't really know.

**James Harden – [Enchantress](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Enchantress)**

Enchantress deals heavy damage at long range. In fact the longer the range, the higher the damage she can deal with her ult. She has a skill called untouchable which slows the attack speed of anyone who attacks her to comically low levels. She abuses this skill to dominate nearly anybody in a 1v1 lane. James Harden is similarly untouchable, with anyone who attempts to defend him immediately whistled for a foul, resulting in constant free throws slowing the game down to comically low levels. Also, her signature skill is enchant which allows her to take control of neutrals for a short duration. Playing against enchantress, there is a constant risk of being ganked by groups of large creeps under her control. This is the exact same risk facing anyone who encounters James Harden at a nightclub.

**Lebron – [Spectre](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Spectre)**

Nobody is more terrifying late in a game than Spectre. She scales harder than anyone and is capable of coming back from enormous deficits by abusing her ult, allowing her to be everywhere on the map damaging anyone on the enemy team. She needs support to get there, but simply put: Spectre is the hardest carry in the game.

**Steph – [Enigma](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Enigma)**

Enigma uses his ult, Black Hole, to suck in the entire enemy team with his inescapable gravity. He is also able to summon an army of demonic conversions to fight for him, much like Steph is able to summon an army of ring chasing vets to fight for him.

**Klay – [Sniper](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper)**

Takes a while to come online, but can deal unparalleled damage from long range.

**KD – [Venomancer](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Venomancer)**

Venomancer is obviously a poisonous snake, but the connection goes deeper than this. Venomancer’s signature skill is plague ward, allowing him to place small immobile units around the map dealing poison damage to anyone they attack. This is analogous to KD’s burner accounts which leave toxic comments all over the internet, poisoning the minds of those who read them.

**Derrick Rose – [Techies](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Techies)**

Techies is iconic, and following his release in dota 2, he was a strong, borderline broken hero. But after a series of nerfs, he has been relegated to the dumpster. Possibly never to return. His signature skill, Blast Off, allows Techies to launch himself at an enemy, dealing massive damage to both himself and enemy heroes in the blast radius. Much like Derrick Rose recklessly launches himself at the rim, with a chance to score and to blow out a knee.

**Kyrie – [Timbersaw](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Timbersaw)**

Timbersaw is a mobile, fast paced hero who zips around fights dealing large bursts of AOE damage to the enemy team. He is also a [paranoid schizophrenic](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/0/0a/Timb_kill_13.mp3) who [believes](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/b/bb/Timb_spawn_04.mp3) that [trees](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/9/95/Timb_begin_02.mp3) are [trying](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/1/17/Timb_ally_01.mp3) to [kill](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/7/77/Timb_death_11.mp3) him [everywhere](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/c/ca/Timb_attack_08.mp3) he [goes](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/1/10/Timb_rare_01.mp3). Nobody understands the burden of this kind of knowledge like Kyrie does. (warning: loud voice responses in the links. RIP headphone users.)

**Joel Embiid – [Axe](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Axe)**

Axe is loud and boisterous. He knows he is the best and makes sure everyone else knows it too. He taunts enemy heroes into attacking him and deals counter damage with his passive. He also throws down massive dunks on low HP heroes.

**Ty Lawson – [Brewmaster](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Brewmaster)**

Brewmaster is an alcoholic.

**Kawhi – [Ursa](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ursa)**

Ursa is adept at pursuing and destroying a single target. Stacking up massive amounts of damage with every swipe of his claws.

**Ricky Rubio – [Crystal Maiden](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Crystal_Maiden)**

Crystal Maiden is fragile and offensively limited, but her support enables her teammates to run amok with roots, slows, and bonus mana regen. They are also both beautiful people.

**Steven Adams – [Centaur Warrunner](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Centaur_Warrunner)**

Centaur has the highest strength of any hero in the game. He is an absolute unit. Although Centaur is usually picked for the utility he provides, he can output a surprising amount of offensive damage when given the chance.

**Russell Westbrook – [Chaos Knight](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Chaos_Knight)**

Chaos Knight is an agent of chaos. He has the highest natural variance of any hero in the game. All of his attributes and skills incorporate this variance. His stun has a random chance to be a useless 1 second stun at the low end, or a game changing 4 second stun at the high end. Westbrook has similarly high variance, sometimes appearing to be the greatest player on earth as he attacks the rim, runs the floor, and nails every jumper. Other times he seems to shoot his team out of games with brick after brick. The Thunder rise and fall as Westbrook does.

**Manu – [Broodmother](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Broodmother)**

A Broodmother pick at the right time can single-handedly win the game against an unprepared team. Everyone knows what Broodmother brings to the table and yet, there seems to be no way to stop it once she gets going. When used at the right time, she can take over games and leave opponents wondering how they let that happen to them.

**Season Awards**

MVP: Anthony Davis

Rationale: New Orleans only got better after Boogie got injured and that was mostly because of AD. After one season, not much has changed for them - in fact, they look even better on paper after adding Randle and the drop-off from Rondo to Payton isn't that significant, given that they have a similar skill set. If he remains active on both ends of the floor and puts up the same numbers from last year,  New Orleans could become a 50 win team, which should be enough for him to win the award. Harden would be my 2nd pick and Lebron my 3rd. Sleepers: Giannis, Kawhi, Embiid

​

ROY: Marvin Bagley III

Rationale: Bagley is, in my opinion, the most NBA-ready player in his class and as such, I could see him putting up an impressive basic stat-line, which, as we all know, would be enough to impress most sports journalists. Behind Bagley, I have Doncic and Sexton. Sleepers: Ayton, Trae Young, Kevin Knox

​

DPOY:  Kawhi Leonard

Rationale: Kawhi's the best perimeter defender in the league and has joined a team that a top-5 defensive team last season. Regardless of whether or not he stays in Toronto, he has a lot of incentive to play well this year if he wants to get that $$$ and a DPOY award, as well as an All-Team selection, basically guarantees him a max contract. My only concerns about this prediction is his injury and how defensively-oriented Nick Nurse is. I wouldn't say he's the clear front-runner, but I think he's definitely a favorite. Behind him are Rudy Gobert and Draymond Green. Sleepers include Embiid, Giannis, AD.

​

6MOY: Tyreke Evans

Rationale: He's the best player in the league that's on the bench. I would say Lou Williams, but he's kind of streaky and is turning 32 this year. At 2nd and 3rd, I have Lou Williams and Eric Gordon. Sleepers include VanVleet, Kuzma, Rozier.

​

MIP: Dejounte Murray

Rationale:  He's in his  third season, getting major minutes on a perennial playoff team that's coached by Popovich. He already has one All-Defensive team selection under his belt and is only going to get better offensively.  In 2nd place is Brandon Ingram and in 3rd is Jamal Murray. Sleepers include Jabari Parker, Dillon Brooks, Malcolm Brogdon.

​

COTY: Brad Stevens

Rationale: I know he has an excellent roster, probably the 2nd best in the league, to work with but I think he should be judged more on how the kind of system he'll set up for these players to thrive in. Additionally, he's shown himself to be incredibly capable with injury-ridden rosters and is a big reason behind the development of Brown, Rozier and Tatum. At 2nd and 3rd, I have Snyder and Gentry. Sleepers include McMillan, Popovich and Malone.

​

EOTY: Masai Ujiri

Rationale: Full disclosure - I'm a Raptors fan. I've tried to be as objective as possible with my other predictions, so I'm going to indulge on this one and give in to my wishful thinking. If Kawhi signs an extension, trading away DeRozan becomes Ujiri's most significant milestone during his tenure as President of Basketball Operations for the Raptors. In fact, I think it could be considered one of the best trades of the decade.  Behind Masai is Magic and Myers. Sleepers include Morey, Ainge, Presti.

​

Rationale: I'm not an expert on advanced analytics, so these are not ESPN-type standings. I just looked at last year's win-loss records for each team and considered how many wins new players and team personnel could add to that.  I think pretty much everyone can agree that Toronto, Boston and maybe Philly are in a tier of their own in the East, which is why the drop-off is so significant after Philly.

Below are explanations for a few of the team's records.

Boston: Irving-Brown-Hayward-Tatum-Horford with Smart, Rozier, Morris on the bench. I think 60 wins is a bare minimum. A starting lineup composed of an All-Star PG with 4 All-Star caliber wings in their 20s, as well as one of the most versatile defensive centers, is destined to win at least 60 wins in today's league.

Toronto: On paper, they look better than last year so it would make sense for them to increase their win percentage. However, I think chemistry issues and Kawhi's injury concerns will cause them to lose some games. Also, if the coach is smart, he'll rest Kawhi and Lowry during the last during the last 5-8 games of the season, which should cost them a few games.

Philadelphia: Like Boston, they have a young core that's only going to get better, hence the 3 extra wins. However, a lot of this is contingent on Embiid staying healthy and Fultz regaining his shooting form.

Chicago: I know they won less than 30 games last year, but when they had their core of Dunn, Mirotic and Markkannen together, they were a playoff-bound team.  it was only when they got serious about tanking that they looked bad. Add Wendell Carter, Jabari Parker and a healthy Zach LaVine to that lineup and I think you have the makings of another young playoff team.

Cleveland: Only reason I didn't have them lower is because I think Kevin Love is great, Sexton will have a great rookie season and Rodney Hood will make the comeback of the century.

New York: This entirely depends on Kristap's recovery. I actually think they're good enough to make a push for the playoffs and they'll look like it when he comes back, but by then, it'll be too late.

Charlotte: I think they're gonna blow it up this year and trade away Kemba and Batum. Hence, the 30 wins.

Orlando: Someone had to be in last place and, although they have some great franchise pieces in Gordon and Bamba, it seems to me that, out of all the teams in the East, they're the most at peace with being a perennial lottery team for now.

GSW: It'll be the same as last year; they'll coast through the regular season, preparing for the playoffs - only this time, they'll do it with Boogie for at least 20-25 games.

HOU: I think losing Ariza and Mbah a Moute will hurt them more than people think, but no significant changes than that,  so 60 wins it is.

DEN: Honestly, they should have won at least this many games last year, had it not been for Millsap's injury and the initial issues with how he fit in the team. I think they'll finally get it together this year and secure their rightful place in the playoffs.

LAL: I would rank them higher, but LeBron seemed to indicate that he was fine waiting for Lonzo, Ingram and Kuzma to fully develop before seriously committing to a championship run.

POR: I think we're approaching the end of the Lillard-McCollum experiment. One of  them is getting traded and the return for either of them won't be enough to keep them in the playoffs.

MIN: Chemistry issues will be the death of this team. That, in addition to Thibodeau's unwillingness to adopt a more modern style of play, will prevent them from staying competitive.

466	Projected Finals MVPs for every year in NBA history	"[Justin Willard of Nylon Calculus has looked at the stats that correlate with winning FMVP.](http://analyticsgame.com/nba/predicting-a-finals-mvp.html)

470	Who is D'Antoni's more ideal guard? Harden or Curry?	"Two of the best offensive players in the nba, botn today and all-time. Who fits D'Antoni better? 

Harden Advantages: Better slasher to collapse the paint and create open 3s (in the corner specifically).

Better/more tireless iso scorer. 

Better at drawing FTs by a big margin, critical when offense stagnates. 

Better passer (although I think this is closer tha people think), especially on drive/kick.

Can switch onto bigs in the paint on defense and hold his own. 

More durable. 

Curry advantages: More efficient scorer at all 3 levels (Harden's volume at the rim is notably higher though, that area is basically a draw) 

Better gravity on the perimeter, which opens up driving lanes for players/allows higher % shots in the paint. 

Better off-ball, so more effective with another ball-handler, causes more havoc for the defense to create open 3s. 

Plays passing lanes well/better hands to force turnovers.

To this point, appears to have better intangibles.

474	Who do you think will end up higher all-time? Curry or KD?	"In terms of the all time great rankings, where do you think those two will end up? Personally I say Curry will end up higher, if not a spot or two. Durant may be the better player, but in terms of overall greatness and impact on the game, I believe Curry has the edge. I also believe that all time great players must have their own team. What I mean is when you think of a team, you automatically think of that player. Ex. Lebron and Cavs, Jordan and Bulls, Bird and Celtics, Duncan and Spurs, etc. 

While Durant has spent most of his career with the Thunder, the majority of his success has come from the past two years with Curry’s Warriors. Durant won’t have a team associated with him when it’s all said and done, and his career will be unique precedent that is shrouded in controversy and doubt. 

While I’m not saying Curry’s impact on the Warriors isn’t the sole reason he’ll end up higher, it certainly has considerable influence. That and being called the second greatest pg, greatest shooter of all time, first unanimous mvp certainly helps Curry’s case as well.

What do you guys think? Will KD or Curry be higher all time? I personally say Curry. I’d love to hear any counterpoints."	nba

476	What is your ideal triple double statline?	"Triple doubles have been a pretty big buzzword lately with Russ basically getting the MVP over it, and although getting a triple double is a bit overstated right now, it’s still incredibly impressive and can be a huge contribution to a team’s success.

But which aspect of the triple double do value most? Would you rather a player score 50 and get 10 rebounds and assists, or do you think a more well rounded statline is more important towards winning?

Some of the greatest triple double statlines:

**Hakeem Olajuwon** (1990): 29 points, 18 rebounds, 11 blocks, 9 assists

**Shaquille O’Neal** (1993): 24 points, 28 rebounds, 15 blocks (My vote for GOAT triple double)

**Wilt Chamberlain** (1968): 22 points, 25 rebounds, 21 assists

**Fat Lever** (1988): 31 points, 16 rebounds, 20 assists, 6 steals (Did you know Far Lever is 6th all time in triple doubles?)

**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar** (1975): 50 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists 

**Russell Westbrook** (2017): 57 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists"	nba

Would you rather add Butler to your team or remove one of Klay or Draymond? What about Embiid? Davis? Etc. 


Note: The Warriors due to their cap situation wouldn't be able to sign someone to replace the player you take off their roster.

Edit: For the purposes of making the discussion interesting let's say the player you add can't be Draymond or Klay. Otherwise you get to cheat and simultaneously improve your team and weaken the Warriors.

The question is supposed to be a tradeoff between improving your team and weakening the Warriors.

486	I wouldn't be surprised to see Durant switch teams next Summer	"Assume the 5-star Warriors super-team wins the title.  Steph/Klay/Draymond will now have 4 titles.  Durant will have 3.  

I just think at some point the guy is going to want to add another layer to his legacy.  

The obvious team to keep an eye out on is the Lakers and their max cap space.  Some think they'll use it on Kawhi.  Others think Klay is a possibility.  I think we should take the possibility of Durant seriously.

Think about it ... Durant and LeBron will both have 3 titles.  Teaming up to try and surpass Steph/Klay/Draymond's 4 would be a hell of a story for the league.  Perhaps Durant would sign a 3 year contract to align with LeBron.   After those 3 seasons they could potentially both have 6 titles.  At that point, Bron probably joins whatever team drafts Bronnie and maybe 34 year old Durant joins an expansion Sonics team or something to end his story on a feel-good note.

It would also be interesting for the legacy of Steph/Klay and Draymond.  Even without Durant, that's a 73 win team perfectly capable of winning titles.  They'd likely still be a contender - possibly even the frontrunner.  If they managed to win another one in spite of Durant/Bron teaming up, it would cement their legacy as one of the greatest trios in NBA history.

It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.

488	If the best 13 players in the league abandoned their own teams to form a super super-team, would they be able to win a championship if they were only allowed four players on the court at once?	"Let's say the league were to create an expansion team that would play in the Eastern conference. This team could draft any thirteen players from any teams it wanted with no protections, however it could only let four players on the court at a time.

The current warriors super-team would probably be stripped of at least three players and would no longer be a major contender. LeBron would obviously be taken from the Lakers, Kyrie probably from the Celtics (even if he's not top 13, it would help to neutralize Boston as a threat), and Harden from the Rockets. So essentially, would an absolute death squad of LeBron, Steph, KD, AD (or some other combo) with the ability to draw from the 5th-13th best players for its subs be able to beat the remaining teams in the league despite being perpetually short one player?

Additionally, if you were forming this team, which other players would you pick more for the purposes of weakening other potential contenders than for actually improving your team? And if this new super-team didn't win, which remaining team would be the championship favorite?

489	MVP Derrick Rose had the filthiest lay-up package the NBA has ever seen. Change my mind	"I don’t think any player in the NBA ever topped Derrick Rose’s variety of finishes and the speed at which he could execute them. 

Kyrie and Steph have pretty nice layup packages, but I have never seen them do anything around the rim that prime Derrick Rose couldn’t. He had the touch, floaters, reverses, underhand, crafty moves, dreamshakes etc. - but could also straight up finish overtop of almost any player in the league, whether it was taking the contact in the air and finishing like butter regardless, fully extending and perfectly releasing the ball at ridiculous points of the backboard with perfect backspin, or just banging on players heads.

Change my mind.

What is it about Kobe's game that can't be captured in this stat, and why does it match the eye test narrative for Jordan, LeBron, and Kareem so well? Freakish coincidence? Luck?

Both great defenders, both great scorers, but Bird has the edge in shooting and is a much much much better passer, along with rebounder. Kobe could score more and was a better defender.

520	Trying to create the best possible offensive playoff run of the post zone-defense era, and then comparing it to Lebron's best playoff runs	"In the 2001-2002, zone defense was introduced, forever changing the way defenses have tried to neutralize great scorers and offensive players.

There have been 16 different series of playoff runs since then. I thought it would be interesting to try to create the best possible offensive playoff run by pulling from the playoff highs in **PPG, Assists per Game, and TS%**,...and then comparing it to Lebron's best playoff runs

**The rules are:**

1. A player must play a minimum of **10** games in a playoff run, and a minimum of **30 mpg.**  Also, he must average a minimum of **25 ppg** to at least make it somewhat interesting.
2. The highest stat that I will pull from **cannot be from Lebron**

Here are my results. There were are a total of 49 different playoff runs over this 16 year span to choose from **not from Lebron.**

Here are the top 3 best playoff runs I could create

# 1

**32.1 ppg**(*Kobe Bryant: 2002-2003)*

**11 assists**(*Westbrook: 2015-2016)*

527	The Lowest Scoring Game in NBA History	"Didn't see this up when I posted earlier, so I'm reposting it:

Thought I'd do this as a follow up to my original post, The Highest Scoring Game in NBA History.

On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons were matched up with the defending NBA champions, the Minneapolis Lakers. The Pistons coach knew he didn't have a lineup that could compete with the Lakers, who had won their last 29 games at home behind the dominant play of star George Mikan, so he ordered his team to stall. Despite their tactics, the Pistons were down 13-11 at the end of the half, and 17-14 after 3 periods. Despite only scoring 1 point in the whole fourth, the Lakers led late, till rookie Larry Foust cut to the basket on an inbounds pass and layed it in over Mikan with 6 seconds left in the game, to give the Pistons a stunning 19-18 victory. Mikan scored 15 of his team's 18 points (83.3%) on 4 of 11 shooting, while his teammates shot 0 for 6 from the field. Lakers coach John Kundla commented that, ""Play like that will kill professional basketball,"" but it was not till 4 years later that the NBA introduced the 24 second shot clock."	nba
528	Charles Barkley with 0.5 seconds left.	"On April 22, 1993, playing their 3rd to last game of the regular season, the Phoenix Suns were locked in a close game against the Trail Blazers. Down 1 point with half a second left in the game, coach Paul Westphal drew up a desperate last second play. Westphal had 6' 9"" forward [Oliver Miller](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/oliver-miller-of-the-sacramento-kings-during-the-game-against-the-picture-id470128485) throw an inbound pass from the sideline off the backboard, telling the Suns in their huddle that the Trail Blazers would stop playing, thinking the game was over. After setting a decoy screen, Barkley would circle around, pick up the ball, and shoot.

[The play somehow worked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFe-71tNPQk)

Barkley won MVP and the Suns made it all the way to the finals before losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. This is still one of the craziest NBA plays I have ever seen."	nba

530	Suns PG acquisitions: tier 1 (Kyrie), tier 2 (Dragic), or tier 3 (Russell)?	"These are the three most logical targets for the Suns imo.  All ECF PGs, so the teams are more willing to deal with each other (they aren’t directly competing for playoff bids).  

1.  Kyrie would be the Celtics attempting to do the Nets trade 2.0.  Kyrie for Tyson Chandler, Mikal Bridges, the Suns unprotected 2020 first rounder, and a 2021 pick swap. 

Suns lose zero pieces from their current core, and acquire a bonafide star to save their GMs job in this apparent ‘progress or bust’ season.

Celtics drop $4M in payroll to duck the luxury tax, and acquire 3 pieces for an eventual Anthony Davis or Giannis pursuit, and they make their rotation minutes clearer, and they avoid the awful decision of overpaying Kyrie or losing him for nothing.   

2.  Dragic.  We know he doesn’t want to be in PHX, so even though that is the rumored deal, I find it less plausible than the one below.  

3.  D-Lo.  This is the one I predict.  He’s cheap for salary matching ($7M in his final year of his rookie deal).  He should require the least talent in return from the Suns (in other words, Kyrie and Dragic will require a greater sum in return).  Russell is also best friends with Devin Booker.  Lastly, the Nets might want to get something in return for D-Lo now, since it helps their plan of keeping two max salary slots open for next summer.  D-Lo’s cap hold is too high to keep him on the books and recruit a max FA tandem (like Kyrie and Butler).  

I predict one of these 3 guys will be the Suns opening day PG.  In order of likelihood:  D-Lo, then Dragic, then Kyrie is the pie-in-the-sky option."	nba
531	Toughest divisions in the NBA this upcoming season?	"The Southwest used to be the toughest, but with Dallas and Memphis rebuilding it's pretty much left only the Rockets, Spurs, and Pelicans as playoff caliber teams.

The Pacific is Golden State, then the Lakers, then everyone else, with the Clippers being a bit above the Suns and Kings.

The Northwest has all playoff caliber teams, but none of them are 50 win contenders, though Oklahoma City might come close.

The Central has declined from its glory days, though Milwaukee is roaring back to relevance behind Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Southeast is probably the most irrelevant division right now.

I think the Atlantic is the toughest this year. Three teams which could make the Finals if the cards fall their way, a hungry Nets team that, even if they don't win a lot of games, will be a tough one to play every night, and even the Knicks aren't as dismal as other teams.

Anyone in NBA history with more than 7?  This does not include shots that happened with more than 5 seconds left, or shots that tied the game.  If it did, Vince would have several more.  In my quick and lazy research, Kobe doesn't have 7 (he does have more mid-range game winners).  Ray Allen comes close, but many of his clutchest shots happened with around 10 seconds left, or tied the game.

All told, I think Vince's lack of playoff success is to often confused with him somehow being unclutch.  Dude has ice in his veins when it came to game winning shots (outside that Philly game, of course...)"	nba

546	in the 1968 NBA season when Wilt Chamberlain lead the league in total assists, he would not pass to hof teammate Chet Walker because of the assist rules from back then where if you dribbled or faked a shot the passer would not get a assist.	"testimonials from two of wilts teammates from that season, [Billy Cunningham](https://books.google.com/books?id=9BaqPfGcI84C&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=wilt+was+very+goal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWm-_qrprdAhXJY98KHVj_AV4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wilt%20was%20very%20goal&amp;f=false) and [Matt Guokas](http://www.nba.com/2012/history/features/01/09/season-of-giants-part3/) (there is no link to the paragraph from this article i'm about to show, just control+f the paragraph on that page)


Billy Cunningham:

 ""Wilt is a very goal-oriented person, and and under Alex (Hannum) he wanted to win a title and become the first center to lead the league in assists. He liked to pass to Hal Greer or myself, because we just caught it and shot it. Chet Walker usually caught the ball, took a dribble or two and then shot it - no assist for Wilt (under the assist rules of that time). So Wilt preferred to give the ball to us.""

Matt Guokas: 

""He said in training camp that he wanted to lead the league in assists. He thought that would be cool. Of course, we all thought that would be cool too. But he didn't want us to run. He wouldn't throw outlet passes off rebounds. Only Billy or Chet were allowed to run out and score on the fastbreak if they got long rebounds.

""Wilt wanted to be involved in every half-court play, so he stood there in the middle and all of us would run around him and he tried to pile up his assists. You've got to remember that assists were kept much more strictly back then. There was none of this stuff like today where you can take three dribbles and a head-fake and it counts. You got assists if you caught the pass and made the shot. So that meant Wilt would only pass it to guys who could catch and shoot -- Luke, Billy sometimes, Wali, Hal and me. In my case, he'd try to get me to just go backdoor for a layup, because he didn't trust me to do much else. And he'd never pass it to Chet Walker, because Chet always had to be pump-faking or use a dribble and take away the assist.""


Chet's numbers did not drop much despite Wilt not passing to him on offense. His ppg average only dropped by 1.4, and he actually took 22 more shot attempts throughout the regular season."	nba

549	Now that both stints are over, who was the more impressive player: Miami LeBron, or 2nd Cleveland-stint LeBron?	"There seems to be a consensus that 2013 LeBron was the best LeBron, but his most recent post-season run was the best I've ever seen him for a sustained period of time.

Not to mention the 2017 Finals where he averaged a triple double. And also not to mention the 2016 post-season run, which we all know included the legendary defeat of the Warriors.

I mean there's no question that he was more of a physical freak of nature during the Miami stint, but after following both stints closely, I really think what he lost in physicality, he more than made up for in other facets (post-game, playmaking, intangibles, general BBIQ, clutchness).

557	Comparing Lebron's top 3 offensive playoff runs with those of the greats	"What I want to achieve here is a comparison of ""peak"", offensive playoff Lebron with the peaks of the best scorers/offensive players of all time. I think 3 playoff runs is enough to qualify as peak. For some people, 2 may be enough as well. Just 1 playoff run is too small of a sample size to legitimately qualify as the entirety of someone's peak for me though.

​

For this I'm going to look at playoff runs with a **minimum of 3 series played**. 2 playoff runs is only half the conceivable length of the playoffs, and is most often in the 6-11 game range. A sample size of say 8 or 9 games is ridiculously small relative to long playoff runs, in which people end up playing 15+ games. A playoff run with at least 3 series played generally ends up being a considerably larger fraction of the playoffs.

The reason I have included Kareem's 1970 playoff run despite only playing 10 games(2 series), is that teams could only play a maximum of 3 playoff series during that time, not 4. So Kareem still played the majority of the playoffs.

558	What is your favorite NBA in-game dunk of all time?	My favorite in-game dunk of all time is Vince over Frederic Weis in the Olympics... but my favorite NBA in-game dunk would have to be Dr. J’s “Rock the Baby” against the Lakers. Curious to hear what other fan favorites are.	nba
559	LeBron James first 40 point game at 19 yrs old, NBA record [Mar. 27, 2004]		nba
560	The time a PF tied the record for most 3's in an NBA Game	On March 13, 2005, the NBA record for most 3's in a game was tied by Donyell Marshall, a PF for the Toronto Raptors. In 28 minutes off the bench, Marshall dropped 38-10-3, shooting 13 of 22 from the field and a scorching 12 of 19 from beyond the arc. He did this despite averaging less than one triple a game for his entire career. Curry and Kobe played 38 and 37 minutes respectively in the games where they had 12 3's. Curry did eventually break the record with 13 3's in a game against the Pelicans, one game after going 0 for 10 from 3. Another insane fact about Donyell, he is just 1 of 11 players to ever rack up 10,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, 750 3-pointers and 750 blocks. The other guys on the list are Lebron, Dirk, KD, Pippen, Shawn Marion, Vince Carter, Sam Perkins, Rasheed Wallace, Tracy Mcgrady, and Clifford Robinson.	nba
561	How can the East ever become equal or better than the West?	Ever since I've been watching basketball (around age 8, born 1991) the West has been better than the East, and often it's not even close in terms of talent/superstars.  Right now maybe 1 or 2 players (assuming Kawhi returns to form) of the top 10 players are in the east, and if you expand that to a top 25 it's still barely 5 out of 25, if that.  So the West has 80%+ of the leagues stars, and no superstars, how do they stop the cycle?  Especially with the lottery rules changing.	nba
562	One of the greatest in game alley-oops of all time!		nba
563	Luol Deng has played a grand total of 57 games (~1497 minutes) for the Lakers. This mean he's earned about $1,13m/game or $43k/min he's played with them.	"Obviously, all assuming my math is correct and so are the reports.

Basically, Luol Deng he is the Sudanese-British player but the Lakers he is the (well-paid) American stars.

567	Why do people feel that Loul Deng deserved minutes in LA?	"The first season of his new contract in LA, he averaged 7/5/1 on 38/30/73 while clearly being the worst defender on the floor at all times. He was still given nearly 27 minutes per game for the majority of that season, he played like a scrub. His advanced stats reflect that, he was a huge negative according to offensive and defensive ratings. His BPM and Vorp was among the worst in the entire league. 

The only reason he even deserved the minutes he got was because in the first half of his rookie season BI was one of the worst players in the league. By the second half, he was already better then what 31 year old Deng was bringing to the table. "	nba

571	Tired of all the switching on defense	"I’ve been watching a few older games this offseason. Last two have been Lakers-Celtics (2010) and Celtics-Knicks (2011)


After watching these games I realized how much I don’t like watching switching defense. Watching Kobe and other players go against their matchup every time was great to watch develop throughout the game. 


Now half the time on offense teams just try to get a switch for a mismatch. Not as exciting watching Steph Curry or Harden try and crossover Stephen Adams. You already know what’s gonna happen 9 times out of 10. 


Or watching the Cavs PG last season set a ball screen for LeBron, hold his man just so he can get guarded by the opposing PG. no shit he’s just gonna bully him to the rack or shoot a short fade over him every time. 


Switching is obviously a legitimate strategy that most teams use bc they thinks it’s the best option. It allows to stop their defense from scrambling to defend the p&amp;r. Just not fun to watch for me at all, hope a new strategy comes up soon. Seems like we’ve gone from hedging puck and rolls, to sinking, now everything is switched"	nba

576	Could Milos Teodosic be the next Steve Nash?	He plays just like him and his long flowy hair is the same greasy consistency as Nash's hair when he was dishing assists between defenders' legs. They're also both late bloomers and international players. 	nba
577	Who are the top 5 centers in the NBA going into next season?	Feels like center ratings are volatile, we can't read too much into the playoffs because of team composition but KAT, Gobert where a shell of themselves playoffs, no doubt they'll eat again regular season. Jokic is very much loved, but he's a 1 way player, his assist ability helps boost him. Out East, Embiid has climbed the ranking cos of his healthy season, same reason why we can't be putting Boggie top 5 cos we don't know what he is right now. Guys like Drummond put up numbers but it never translates to Ws, wheras a guy like Al Horford may not have the numbers but Celtic fans will tell you he's the most important piece who brings it all together and he gets the Ws.

So, here are the Metal Gear Solid equivalents of NBA players.

​

SPOILERS: if you plan on playing any Metal Gear Solid game, then come back when you've finished. There will be many spoilers below and you don't want to see them.

​

[**Big Boss**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Boss) \- **Michael Jordan** \- The GOAT. After surviving Soviet GRU soldiers (Bad Boy Pistons), defeating the Cobra Unit (Late 80s Celtics), and finally killing his mentor, The Boss (Magic Johnson), he became a legend and earned the title of Big Boss. He's also kind of an asshole at times.

[**Venom Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Venom_Snake) \- **""The Black Mamba"" Kobe ""Vino"" Bryant** \- The non-genetic clone of Big Boss' appearance and abilities. One of the greatest ever, but he never reached the level of Big Boss. He embraces his role as the villain. He's also kind of an asshole at times.

[**The Boss (The Joy)**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Boss) \- **Magic Johnson** \- Revolutionized combat. She paved the way for all the soldiers who came after her. She was also very team-first and selfless, but could dominate any situation if necessary. Was also code-named ""The Joy,"" probably because she has 5-Star smile [like this](https://www.google.fi/search?q=magic+johnson+smiling&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSvcyIkpbdAhWIh1QKHcF4A4cQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=763). Defeated by Big Boss at the end of Operation Snake Eater ('91 NBA Finals).

[**Zero**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Zero) \- **Danny Ainge** \- The grand architect. A decent soldier who grows to eventually become the Root of All Evil. He is obsessed with controlling the world and has no loyalty beyond that end. Everybody, rightfully, hates him.

[**EVA**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/EVA) \- **Scottie Pippen** \- The surrogate mother of the Sons of Big Boss. What happens when you get the Perfect combination of Jordan/Pippen? See below.

​

**The Cobra Unit** \- **Late 80s Celtics**

[**The End**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_End) \- Larry ""Leg-End"" Bird - Legendary sniper who is reduced to a wheelchair when not in battle. The End is reeaaaally old, so let's say he's in the wheelchair because of back problems.

[**The Fear**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Fear) \- Kevin McHale - Defenders feared McHale's legendary ""Torture Chamber.""

[**The Sorrow**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sorrow) \- Bill Walton -  Can communicate with the dead. Probably a skill Bill Walton has too.

​

**GRU** \- **Bad Boy Pistons**

[**Revolver Ocelot**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Revolver_Ocelot) \- **Dennis Rodman** \- former enemy, then close ally of Big Boss (MJ). His flashy personality during battle and willingness to work behind the scenes with no recognition has led many to forget how truly great he was. In his later years, he allies himself with his own enemy (Kim Jong-un) in order to Save the World , even if it means he will die a villain.

[**Volgin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Yevgeny_Borisovitch_Volgin) \- Bill Laimbeer - the big guy

[**Raikov**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Ivan_Raidenovitch_Raikov) \- ~~Isaiah~~  Isiah Thomas - the little guy. Incidentally also Volgin's secret lover.

[**Granin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Aleksandr_Leonovitch_Granin) \- Chuck Daly - The architect of the organization. He first conceived of the super-weapon ""[Shagohod](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Shagohod)"" (the Jordan Rules). It would eventually be transformed into the ""[Metal Gear](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_(weapon)),"" a bipedal nuclear tank.

​

**Sons of Big Boss**

[**Solid Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solid_Snake) **- Russel Westbrook -** An imperfect clone of Big Boss. A pure soldier who only cares about completing the mission and the occasional smoke.

Solid Snake's allies - 2019 OKC:

[**Jonathan**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Jonathan) \- Steven Adams - The muscle.

[**Hal Emmerich / Otacon**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Hal_Emmerich) \- Billy Donovan - The brains. Helps out a lot but is clearly second banana to Solid Snake.

[**Drebin**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Drebin_893) \- Paul George - An ally out of necessity at first. Eventually proves to be trustworthy.

​

[**Liquid Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Liquid_Snake) **- Kevin Durant -** Another imperfect clone of Big Boss. He is Solid Snake's [BROTHER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o72FGjCgUX8) and bitter rival. He cares too much about what Big Boss thinks of him and wants to make him proud by taking over the world, by any means. He assembles a very talented crew for that purpose, (the similarities end here) but is defeated by Solid Snake.

Liquid's allies - 2019 GSW:

[**Sniper Wolf**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Sniper_Wolf) \- Stephen Curry - Perhaps the greatest shooter ever.

[**Vulcan Raven**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Vulcan_Raven) \- Draymond Green - wise but always angry. His armor and heavy weapons makes him effective at defense.

[**Psycho Mantis**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Psycho_Mantis) \- Andre Iguodala - a psychic. Can anticipate his opponent's next move (i.e. high BBIQ).

[**Fortune**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Fortune) \- Shaun Livingston - Extremely lucky, so she can never die. Kind of like how Livingston's had a successful career, despite the injuries.

[**Fatman**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Fatman) \- Javale McGee - A joke character. (I know he's not a warrior anymore).

[**Vamp**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Vamp) \- Klay Thompson - idk how they are equivalent, but I can't leave out both Vamp and Klay.

​

[**Solidus Snake**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solidus_Snake) **- LeBron James -** A perfect clone of Big Boss. Eventually becomes President of the US. LeSnake is defeated by Raiden.

​

**Other Characters**

[**Raiden**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Raiden) \- Giannis A... - Young and counted out. Eventually becomes a badass Cyborg Ninja (a ""unicorn"").

[**Gray Fox**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Gray_Fox) \- Ben Simmons - A promising soldier who seemingly dies, then comes back as another badass Cyborg Ninja.

[**Master Kazuhira Miller**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Kazuhira_Miller) \- Grant Hill - A highly skilled soldier who suffered major injuries, but continues to be effective in a reduced role.

[**Skullface**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Skull_Face) \- Reggie Miller - Constantly thwarted by Big Boss. Is eventually defeated for good by Venom Snake. Also **Horrifically Ugly** .

[**Quiet**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Quiet) \- Peja Stojakovic -  Deadly Sniper who can't speak English. (I'm sure Peja can speak English, but I just chose the best international shooter that came to mind). [Here is what Peja might look like in Quiet cosplay.](https://www.google.com/search?q=borat+swimming+suit&amp;rlz=1C1LEND_enUS507US512&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK6ImCn5jdAhVLz1QKHRvtD9AQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=763) (Maybe NSFW?)

[**Huey Emmerich**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Huey_Emmerich) \- Phil Jackson - Was the lead engineer/scientist for both Big Boss (MJ) and Venom Snake (Kobe). Helped perfect the concept of the [Metal Gear weapon](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_(weapon)) (the Triangle Offense).

[**Sunny**](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Sunny_Emmerich) \- Steve Kerr - a relative youngster who creates a [weapon](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/FOXALIVE) to surpass Metal Gear (Pace and Space Offense)

Well that's that. I had to leave out a few characters and notable NBA players because then it would be longer than it already is. Feel free to come up with your own comparisons in the comments, and I hoped you enjoy it!"	nba
581	Help me understand this	How is LeBron blocking Jimmy Butler’s attempting shot in end of Wolves vs Cavs then LeBron clutching to win the game few minutes later ... best play of this year? NBA posted the number one play of year and it was that. Don’t get me wrong, I’m LeBron’s biggest fan but I cannot put finger to it. I could think of few other plays being better than that. Was it because Cavs were going downhill and they needed to see bright light? 	nba

My pick is Joe Ingles.

If you're feeling generous, give me your starting 5 of these type of players.

Edit: We'll define a rotation player as someone that averages at least 12 minutes of playing time but isn't an all-star caliber player.

Applaud him for everything he does to make himself good enough and like he had nothing else to accomplish at GSW. We need to call all 14 year olds to get on twitter and give him complements until there are no more haters on his TL. I believe this will be the best strategy fans can use to get him out of GSW and restore the competitive balance in the NBA.
I’m going to go first: 
KD if you’re reading this... don’t ever get a haircut or brush your hair. It is perfect as it is. Everyone got their own style, nappy just happens to be yours. Be comfortable in your own skin, until you shed into a new one. Have a great year KD."	nba

593	[NPR - How I Built This Podcast] Mark Cuban insinuates his relationship with the refs probably cost him a championship in 2006	"Guy Raz (host): 

'Do you cause trouble for fun or do you just do it because you like to fight?'

Mark Cuban: 

'Just depends on the circumstance, If I'm playing pick up or I'm playing in the league, I'm never arguing over calls. If I'm in a league and there's a bad call ok that's the way it goes. In the NBA it's a lot different particularly when I first got there. When I first got to the NBA refs really worked at managing the game rather than calling the game by the rule back. **I remember early on reading something from the Director of Officiating back then who said we don't call the game the same in the last minute as we do in the first minute. Which just enfuriated me to no end and then from their it was like ok I'm on a mission to make this fair and it set me off with a lot of those guys and probably cost me a championship in 2006** but it's come a long way since and I think I'm better for it and the NBA is better for it.'

597	What do you guys/girls think about Andrew wiggins career so far, and what do you expect for him this upcoming year.	For me wiggins really hasn't met a lot of peoples expectations of being a phenom, instead his been quite disappointed. Based on the fact he hasn't been a good defender, isn't a good playmaker nor a good 3rd option. He seems better as a n1 or n2 option on a bad team, but on a playoff team that has Towns and butler. He didn't fit well last year, I expect him to at least this upcoming year to be more of an off ball scorer threat. As well as a consistent defender, his shown moments and stretches he can be good defensively. But other stretches he looks worse than most bad defenders in the league.	nba
598	Realistically, what could Al Horford do to escape the Hall of Very Good?	"Current Notable Accolades:

5x All Star

Back-to-back NCAA Champion

1x All NBA Third Team

1x All Defense Second Team

&amp;nbsp;

It could be difficult for Al to get another All-Star berth without being an injury replacement. Lebron and DeRozan left, Porzingis won't make it, but on the other hand Kawhi will take a spot and most likely Simmons and Griffin as well. On his own team, Hayward could take one of the frontcourt spots assuming his health. That was just for next season but after that Al will probably take a lesser role on the team.

All-NBA would be very difficult but another All-Defense team isn't out of the question. The Celtics have continuity on their side and the defense will most likely stay elite.

Al's team playoff success has been decent (major piece in 10 series wins and 10 series losses) but is a championship realistic with Al as the 2nd/3rd best player? And when his role is reduced down the line will the ring mean as much as the 4th/5th best player?

&amp;nbsp;

Unless he wins a title, the rare B2B college chips would probably be the most impressive thing on his resume. That wouldn't be enough to squeeze into the HoF so some more deep playoff runs is mandatory."	nba
599	The Most Inspirational Moment in Finals History	"The 1970 NBA Finals was one of the greatest finals series of all time. The Lakers were fresh off a painful Game 7 loss in the 1969 Finals, while the New York Knicks stormed into the finals with a 60-22 record. Game 1 went to the Knicks while Game 2 went to the Lakers. The Knicks appeared to have Game 3 wrapped up, but Jerry West hit a 60 footer at the buzzer to tie the game, a moment that has been immortalized today as, ""The Shot."" It wasn't enough to prevent New York from winning Game 3. The Lakers took Game 3, while the Knicks won Game 5. However, Knicks star center Willis Reed suffered a severe thigh injury in Game 5 and a torn muscle kept him out of Game 6, where the Lakers cruised to an easy 22 point victory. Due to the severity of his torn muscle, Reed was considered unlikely to play in Game 7 at the Madison Square Garden. Reed decided to try to get an injection for the pain so he could play. However, his skin was so thick that the doctor had trouble even getting the needle in. When Reed managed to hobble over to where the Knicks were warming up, the Garden roared in delight. Knicks starting forward Dave DeBuscherre thought, ""There is no place in the world I would rather be right now."" Reed scored New York's first 4 points, his only points of the game, and held Wilt to 2 of 9 shooting. By the time he left, with 3:05 in the first half, New York was up 61-37. Walt Frazier finished with 36 points and 19 assists, as the Knicks won 113-99. Reed was named Finals MVP, and in the locker room afterward, an emotionally moved Howard Cosell told Reed,""You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer."""	nba

608	"""Legit"" Rings vs ""Not Legit"" Rings - help me understand and lay out criteria. (Serious)"	"So i hear the sentiment of KD ring not being legit. I am not posting to argue for or against that statement - however because it is so common want to dig a little further and am wondering what criteria would have to be met for rNBA to say a ring is ""not legit"" and what each persons threshold is. I think the extremes are pretty obvious - where a team is clearly led by 1 person (03 duncan, 11 Dirk) vs created superteams whether by free agency (Miami/2nd stint Cle Lebron, Warriors KD, 2000 lakers Shaq) or trades (Boston). I also realize that this may be less black/white and more of a grey scale - so then I pose the question what factors do you take into account that tip the scales one way or another (Ex. If you think KDs championships in GS mean less the Lebrons in Miami because he joined a better team. But think Lebrons in Miami mean less the Dirks or Duncans because he joined a super team etc etc etc). Personally i believe every championship is legit which is why i find this subjective weighting of chips so interesting.  

PS - do not say joining a 73 win team you had a 3-1 lead on unless you believe that meeting those criteria are the ONLY way for a ring not to be legit. "	nba

616	Trying To Fix The WNBA	"With many WNBA players coming out and asking for higher wages, many basketball fans have had the chance to express their thoughts about the WNBA. From what I've read, it seems that most NBA fans find the more fundamentally-sound style of WNBA play to be boring, giving the league less viewership, and in turn, less revenue. Today, I'm gonna try to come up with some hypothetical rule changes to the WNBA thats would make games more exciting and help to differentiate the league further from the NBA.

&amp;#x200B;

1. 20 Second Shot Clock

When I have tried to watch WNBA games, my biggest gripe is how slowly the game seems to be played. Shortening the shot clock would incentivize running offenses at faster paces, which would naturally lead to more exciting play.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Lower Rims

&amp;#x200B;

WNBA player, on average, are 7 inches shorter than NBA players. Despite this, both leagues use 10 foot tall hoops. I believe lowering the rims would allow for more dunks and alley oops, two of the most electrifying plays in basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

3. 3 point alley oops

&amp;#x200B;

This one's simple enough. Make alley oops worth 3 points in an attempt to incentivize them.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these rule changes wouldn't completely revitalize the WNBA and aren't perfect, but I believe they would go a long way towards making the league more entertaining and profitable."	nba

621	Thanos Snaps the NBA: The Los Angeles Clippers	"Again, to clarify my methods. There is a 50% chance that a player will be snapped (killed) by Thanos. This time I used random.org to determine if a player survived.

Snapped: Marcin Gortat, Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Wesley Johnson, Boban Marjonovic, Sindarius Thornwell, Johnathan Motley

Survivors: Tobias Harris, Danilo Gallinari, Milos Teodosic, Jawun Evans, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jerome Robinson, Angel Delgado, Avery Bradley, Mike Scott, Luc Mbah a Moute, Montrezl Harrell

Losing Beverly, Williams, and Gortat aren't fun, but I feel like the Clippers walk away from this snap in a better place than they were pre-snap.  This team clearly isn't a world-beater, but they have depth at every position except maybe center, though you could slide into a 3F small lineup if needed (especially considering how many centers have been snapped across the league). If Shai can't handle the starting Guard spot, Teodosic can fill in just fine. I think this team can sneak into the playoffs as a 8 seed, assuming the West doesn't fill out with post-snap powerhouses.

Position | Player
---|---
G | Gilgeous-Alexander
G | Avery Bradley
F| Gallinari
F | Harris
C| Harrell
6 | Mbah a Moute

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6xatsp/grading_zach_lowes_30_predictions_for_the/dmeyue7/

in fact i totally forgot I did this......

So how did they come around?

1. Golden state repeats -- yep
2. James Harden wins MVP -- yep
3. cavs win east -- my theory is ""you choose a team with lebron to win the east until proven otherwise"". Well this definitely won't be the case this year, but history has shown that a eastern team with lebron has a great chance to win the conference, no matter how they look
4. Rudy Gobert win DPOY -- yep
5. Charlotte goes up 4 spots for pt per possession -- i actually don't know how to check this. The best I could find was offense ranking, which Charlotte only went up one spot
6. Derrick Rose plays more than 41 games -- yep. he played 50 games total
7. Lonzo Ball wins rookie of the year -- well, even without ben simmons, mitchell will get that spot, then tatum? Lonzo had no chance
8. Utah still somehow manages to win 50 -- 48 - 34 was good but not good enough to make this prediction come true
9. McDermott time! Wins most improved player!!!! -- okay this didn't happen......
10. Carmelo Anthony gets traded in Feb, not before season starts -- hoodie melo was a short-lived legend

so the result was 5 for 10, but some of them are not even that crazy. I'll need to try harder this year.

629	Those who watched Stockton play, do you agree with this characterization of his play?	"&gt; He was listed at 6-foot-1, but played even smaller. He was bothered by larger defenders and struggled among the trees, both with his vision and scoring. He was even hesitant to enter the lane at times because he had a hard time scoring or passing when in there

&gt; Unlike all offensive forces in history, Stockton rarely took the attack to his man. He was more Rajon Rondo than Steve Nash, often pounding the ball while options materialized out of Utah’s off-ball screens. 

&gt; He could architect brilliant plays, but only occasionally. 

&gt; Overall, he was a very good, but not great passer. He uncorked a number of quality assists per game, but he missed too many elite passes. 

&gt; On defense, Stockton’s rotations were excellent. He used his quickness to overcome a size disadvantage, ping-ponging from one advantageous spot to another, darting to help-the-helper when needed.

&gt; Stockton was also an expert at sniping the post.

&gt; However, his size prevented him from bothering bigger players. Larger guards like Terry Porter fared well against him, backing him into the post where he was vulnerable. 

&gt; Stockton’s inability to pressure opponents and create havoc in the lane significantly dampened his impact as an offensive dynamo. Great players don’t have to score, but their threat to score generates global impact. Stockton simply wasn’t capable of this. 

&gt; The playoffs exposed these weaknesses in Stockton.

&gt; Stockton’s regular season efficiency is deceptive. He wasn’t an unstoppable force like Shaq, nor did he gain an advantage with marksmanship like Reggie Miller or Steph Curry. Instead, his efficiency was fueled by conservatism — he shot well because he only took premium shots. 


&gt; Passing like Stockton’s can be additive, it’s not game-changing. And while his shooting scales well, he was reluctant to fire open shots. 

&gt; Still, his consistency was exceptional. For a decade, he ticked like a metronome, clocking out nearly identical seasons every year. "	nba

642	Game on the Line - which players would you pick to take the Full-Court Heave, 3, Mid-Range, 3-Footer, Dunk or FT?	"This randomly popped in my head and it got me thinking about which players I would pick with the game on the line, absolutely needing a bucket. 

You can choose a player from any era and it's assumed they are in their prime when they take the shot.

Here's my list:

Full Court Heave - I'm taking Steph from 2016. Dude was an absolute beast at hitting those shots that season and I can't think of anyone else i'd rather have.

3-Pointer - A little more tricky because their are so many good 3 point specialists. I'm gonna throw a curveball however and pick Larry Fucking Bird. Game on the line, i'm betting Larry Legend shit talks the opposing team before drilling the 3 in their face.

Mid-Range - Gotta be the GOAT Michael Jordan. We saw it in 1998, we saw it in 1989, if the game is on the line and you need a mid range from anywhere on the court you'd be a fool to not take MJ.

3-Footer - Gotta be Kareem and his sky-hook. Most unblockable, unstoppable shot in the history of the game. 

Dunk - This was tough but I think i'd take Shaq in 2001. What a beast, if he absolutely needed a dunk to seal the game (lets hope he's not fouled and has to hit FT's) I think Shaq would deliver during his prime.

FT's - Another one for MJ. Game on the line I wouldn't want anyone else taking those FT's. Yea, his % isn't the highest but its not about that. He wanted to hit the FT to rip your heart out.

That's it - what do ya'll think?"	nba

(Can't find)

The Lakers had been on a 7-game losing streak prior to this, including two back-to-back blowout losses of 36 points and 27 points. They had fallen to almost .500, and were in real danger of missing the playoffs in the West.

This is when Kobe went full nuclear mode, scoring 4 straight 50-point games and 5 straight 40-point games. The Lakers won all 5 games, and they needed all of Kobe's points, as they won every game by single digits. 

Bonus: Kobe and Carmelo Anthony had been battling for the scoring title this season. The final game of the Lakers' 7-game losing streak was against Carmelo and the Nuggets, and Melo outscored Kobe in a 27 point blowout. This really lit a fire in Kobe, and over the rest of the season he took a definitive lead in what HAD been a neck-and-neck scoring title race. Kobe finished the season with 31.6 PPG, Melo with 28.9 PPG.

651	Kobe vs Lebron's top 3 playoff series(but done correctly this time)	"There was a post titled "" Kobe vs Lebron top 3 playoff series: ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9bym0b/kobe\_vs\_lebron\_top\_3\_playoff\_series/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9bym0b/kobe_vs_lebron_top_3_playoff_series/))

This post took the ""best"" three playoff series of each player, and ""averaged"" them. The reason why there are quotation marks is that:

**No.1 :** They did not define what the ""best"" three playoff series for each player were. It was some combination of statistical dominance and defensive ranking of opponent.  For Kobe, they took two series against the **No.1** ranked defensive team in the league, and one series against the **No.19** ranked Phoenix Suns. For Lebron, it was two series against the **No.1** ranked defensive team, and one series against the **No.4**  ranked 2016 Warriors.

**No.2:** They didn't actually average the shooting numbers correctly to account for the number of games at all. They just took the overall FG%, FT%, and 3Point % and divided it by 3, as opposed to taking the total shot attempts/makes and then dividing by the number of games appropriately. Also they forgot to include TS%, which is the best measure of efficiency in terms of scoring.

I will fix this, and do what the post intended to do, but this time without misleading people. What I am doing, and I will state this, is take the ***3 most statistically impressive series for each player, list them, and then correctly average the numbers***

# Kobe's top 3 playoff series(in no order)

1. *2009 WCF against Nuggets(6 games)*: **34 ppg, 5.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, on 63 % TS**
2. *2010 WCF against Suns(6 games):* **33.7 ppg, 7 rebounds, 8 assists, on 64 % TS**
3. *2001 WCSF against Kings(4 games):* **35 ppg, 9 rebounds, 4 assists**, **on 59 % TS**

**Cumulative Averages: 34 ppg, 7 rebounds, 6.2 assists, on 62 % TS**

​

Average Defensive Ranking of opponent(via DRTG): **11.3**

​

# Lebron's top 3 playoff series(in no order)

1. *2009 ECF against Magic(6 games)*: **38.5 ppg, 8.3 rebounds, 8 assists, on 59 % TS**
2. *2017 ECSF against Raptors(4 games):* **36 ppg, 8.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, on 73 % TS**
3. *2017 finals against Warriors(5 games):* **33.5 ppg, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, on 63 % TS**

​

**Cumulative Averages :  36.2 ppg, 9.5 rebounds, 8 assists, on 64 % TS**

​

Average Defensive Ranking of opponent(via DRTG): **3.6**

​

The idea of averaging three playoff series as well is inherently pretty stupid, but this is at least the correct way of doing what that post intended to do.

657	Jason Terry averaged 20 ppg in the Finals for his career	"20.0/2.0/3.3 on .574 ts% are the averages over 12 games (2006 and 2011 NBA finals).

For his career he averaged: 13.4/2.3/3.8 on .554 ts%

In his best season (2009 imo) he averaged: 19.6/2.4/3.4 on .571 ts%

---

Anyone else surprised at how he stepped it up in the Finals? Usually where the stars rise and the role players get a reduced role. I know he was basically the second option on both teams, but it's not like anyone thinks either of the 2006 or 2011 Mavericks were a big 2 with Dirk and Jet. Also he went against Wade in both Finals. Not exactly an easy match up.

He's one of [33 players to average 20 or more in the Finals](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career_finals.html) for their careers. Everyone is in or will be in (KD, LBJ, Steph, Kobe, Dirk, Wade, Duncan) in the HOF except Kyrie (he's on the path but needs to do more while the others could retire now and make it), Billups (honestly not sure if he's a HOFer?), Andrew Toney (only played 8 seasons, tho wouldn't make it if he kept his averages for a longer career), and Gus Williams (borderline HOF career) are the others.

658	How do you think the Miami Heat(2014) would've fared with a PRIME Hassan Whiteside?	"Hassan signed with the Heat about two months into the 2014-2015 season. Less than 6 months after Lebron left the Heat and rejoined the Cavs. Even though Hassan Whiteside is a liability on the court these days, back during the 2014-16 seasons, dude was BEAST. I vivdly remember his debut game against the Bulls. He had a triple double with 12 blocks completely shutting them down. Dude was such an asset for us back than that his injury during the playoff series vs the Raptors (2016) was the swinging point in Raptors favors (Robbed us of a much awaited Wade vs Lebron playoff match up). 

But what always frustrated me as Heat fan looking back is that we discovered such a hidden gem in Hassan only after the fact Lebron had already left. During those 4 years, the Center position was our Achilles heel. Teams would kill us in reboubds and post ups. Hassan Whiteside was a force. And i believe, he would've been a HUGE help to us. Especially in 2014 against a Tim Duncan who would eat us alive on the post and Tony Parker getting in lanes. "	nba

677	The Only Finals MVP to lose the Finals	"I've been reading a bit about how LeBron should've been the finals MVP in 2014-15 despite being on the losing team, and remembered that this actually happened once. In 1969, Jerry West won the inaugural Finals MVP award despite losing the series 3-4 to the last Celtics team featuring Bill Russell. Here are his per game lines.

Game 1: 53-3-10

Game 2: 41-3-8

Game 3: 24-1-6

Game 4: 40-6-4

Game 5: 39-3-9

Game 6: 26-4-3

Game 7: 42-13-12

Series Average of 38/4.7/7.5

West pulled a hamstring 3 minutes before the end of Game 5. He put up a 40 point triple double in Game 7 of the NBA Finals on a bum ankle. That is insane.

Here's the wikipedia account of the 7th game:

In anticipation of a Lakers win, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had ordered thousands of balloons with ""World Champion Lakers"" printed on them suspended from the rafters of the Forum. Flyers were placed in every seat stating, ""When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the rafters, the USC marching band will play ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.""\[1\] Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans.\[2\] When Jerry West went to the court for a pre game shoot around and saw the balloons, he became furious with Cooke. Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, ""Those fucking balloons are staying up there.""\[1\] With only two true guards on the Laker roster and West still feeling the effects of the hamstring pull, Celtics coach Russell ordered his players to fast break at every opportunity.

Los Angeles shot poorly in the early going, and the Celtics jumped out to a first-quarter 24–12 lead which was cut to 59–56 at halftime. Then, Celtics sixth man Don Nelson scored 12 points in the third quarter, while the Lakers hardly connected on a quarter of their field goal attempts: the Celtics led 91–76 after the third. Early in the fourth quarter, Chamberlain incurred his fifth foul (he had never fouled out of a game in his career) and had to play more tentative defense. Then, with just over 5 minutes remaining and the Lakers trailing 103-96, Chamberlain landed awkwardly when grabbing a rebound and came to the bench with an injured knee. Behind backup center Mel Counts, the Lakers cut the lead to 103–102 with two minutes left. Chamberlain then informed Van Breda Kolff that he was ready to return, but the coach infamously told the superstar center ""we're doing fine without you"", and Chamberlain never got back in the game. Boston still held the 103-102 lead with 1:33 left in the game when reserve guard Keith Erickson knocked the ball away from John Havlicek. The ball went right to Don Nelson, who put up a desperation 18 foot shot from the free throw line to beat the 24 second clock; the ball hit the back rim, bounced high in the air and fell through the hoop to give Boston a 105-102 lead. The Lakers committed costly turnovers in the last moments and trailed 108-104 before making a meaningless last second shot that made the final score 108–106.

[Warren + Anderson + 2019 MIL 1^st round pick for **Kemba Walker and Nic Batum** - ](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yc68xarc)This trade is broken up into two trades because Ryan Anderson can't be traded with another player. [Here is the second trade](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y7f22mbo). Charlotte saves a bunch of moneyby swapping Batum for Anderson. They get a quality wing player (something the Hornets haven't had for some time) and a pick for Kemba.

&amp;nbsp;

**IND**


[Anderson + 2019 PHX 1^st round pick for **Thad Young and Corey Joseph** -](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ybyoy7t2) A bizarre trade at first glance, but let's evaluate this further. I think it is pretty obvious from the Suns perspective; a solid big man that can play the 4 next to Ariza and Ayton. A cheap point guard that doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective, and most importantly...cap flexibility. 

The Pacers have Collison as their pg and just spent a *first round pick* on Aaron Holiday, a young pg with professional pedigree. **ALSO** Thad Young opted into his contract this offseason, he knew he wouldn't make as much on the open market! Even the Pacers wouldn't give him a big deal, they know Sabonis is the future, and even with growing pains sharing the floor with Turner, he's their guy. Anderson is still the quality bench scorer that would play perfectly with Tyreke Evans and McBuckets. The pick is gravy.

What would be interesting is if the two teams could work out a [Warren for **Aaron Holiday and Bojan Bogdanovic** -](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y9xntufy) A move the benefits the time lines for both teams.

&amp;nbsp;

**NYK**


[Chandler + Okobo + Daniels + 2019 PHX 1^st round pick for **Frank Ntilikina and Joakim Noah** -](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ydbpa2a4) New York would only do this to clear cap space. But getting a raw prospect in Okobo, plus a potential lottery pick *and* clearing cap space....for a point guard that maybe better off ball? What else would NY need from PHX?


&amp;nbsp;


**DAL**

If we agree the Mavs are *stealth*-tanking to ~~get~~ keep their pick next year (in a surprisingly nice draft) then maybe **Dennis Smith Jr** can be bought? BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT; I'm **NOT** saying Dallas *should or would,* but if they believe a Luka/RJ pairing would be more successful than a Luka/Dennis combo then what's DSJ's value?

[Bender + 2019 MIL 1^st + 2019 PHX 1^st for **Dennis Smith Jr.** -](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=yay4p7bh) Dirk mentoring Bender might be the Dragon's only shot, but how about the Euro paring with Luka? Dallas could not-so sneakily bottom out while letting Luka, Bender and Dirk play FIBA Ball  and wind up with 20 wins. It's the Kobe-Laker-tank2.0! Having their own top-5 pick and Phoenix's lottery pick the Mavs could wind up with Cam Reddish and Bol Bol? Yes please.

&amp;nbsp;

**NOP**

What if the Pelicans trade Anthony Davis to ~~GS~~ Boston midway through the season? If Danny Ainge makes a godfather offer and pries the Brow out of New Orleans could we see the front office move Jrue Holiday too if the price was right?

[Anderson + Chandler + Bender +Warren + 2019 MIL 1^st + 2019 PHX 1^st for  **Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic** -](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=ycomwb6x) This is [another multi-part trade](http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y9obdm7l) But is it enough? Too much?


&amp;nbsp;

**SAS**

Is it crazy to think Dejounte Murray would command more of a return than DSJr? At $1.5M Murray has to be damn near untouchable. Crazy

696	"(Mar 2009) Shaq's rips ORL coach Stan Van Gundy for accusing him of 'flopping': ""Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching"""	"[One of Shaq's greatest rants](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3953133) which was in response [to this play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyk7IrlPjpQ)

 Full context:

&gt;The episode that inspired this latest Shaq rant came after O'Neal took an elbow to the chest from Dwight Howard during a third-quarter Magic possession during Orlando's 111-99 victory and crumbled to the floor looking to draw an offensive foul.

&gt;**""I was shocked, seriously shocked,"" Van Gundy said, ""and very disappointed because he knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.""**



&gt;O'Neal acknowledged he had flopped, but said it was the first time he had done it in his career. Over the years, O'Neal has been particularly critical of players (most notable Vlade Divac) who had flopped while trying to defend him.

&gt;**""Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching,"" O'Neal said, steering the conversation back to Van Gundy. ""I'm not going to just sit abound and let nobodies take shots at me, and he is a nobody to me. And if he thinks he can get in a little press conference and take shots at me like I'm not going to [give] something back, he's got another thing coming.""**


And Shaq didn't stop there either:

&gt;""I heard his comment. Flopping to me is doing it more than one time, and I realized when I tried to take the charge, as I went down, I realized that that play reminded me of his whole coaching career,"" O'Neal said of Van Gundy. ""And one thing I really despise is a front-runner, so I know for a fact that he's a master of panic, and when it gets time for his team to go in the postseason and do certain things, he will let them down because of his panic. I've been there before, I've played for him.""

\#||Team|Record|Comment				
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--				
1.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	13-3	|	The defending Super Bowl champions will start the season with Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles at QB.  While the preseason raised more questions than it answered, if the Eagles intend to repeat, then Foles will need to shine until Carson Wentz is cleared to take back the reins.
2.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	13-3	|	""Each year is a new year, and each year has its own challenges. Again, each year we all have to regain our — to the best we can — our ability to perform our jobs. That's what I'm trying to do. I think that's what all of the players, all of the coaches, we're all trying to do that."" - Bill Belichick.
3.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	13-3	|	Last year the Vikings had two top-ten-graded WRs, two top-ten-graded TEs, a surprisingly decent O-line that ranked 17th in pass blocking grade and 13th in run blocking grade, and the #1 defense in the NFL. They followed that up this off-season by upgrading at QB, signing a pro bowl DT (making it six total pro bowlers on the defense), and got Dalvin Cook back. Last time they looked this good (in 2010), everyone died, the team went 6-10 and our stadium collapsed. So fans are all pretty excited to find out how they're gonna lose their seventh-straight NFC Championship Game.
4.	| [](/NO) | Saints |	11-5	|	The Saints come into the 2018 season with high expectations. Answering the defensive questions alongside the explosion of one of fantasy football's favorite new weapons caused a big stir in 2017 and had them a play away from a title game. On paper the only limitation to them is a Drew Brees regression, which they appear to have built contingencies for.  They lose Mark Ingram to start the season, but have a pretty favorable schedule in those 4 weeks.
5.	| [](/LA) | Rams |	11-5	|	News of the Rams' big name signings and extensions were among the top NFL headlines this off-season, as massive improvements on both sides of the ball gives fans tremendous hope for this season. Still, an embarrassing early exit in the playoffs last year leaves them appropriately skeptical if this team can execute on their talent when needed.  While it is nice to have a *floor* of 8-8, instead of a *ceiling* of 8-8 (Fisher scars remain), the goal is to play football in February.
6.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	13-3	|	Straight to the point: Le'Veon Bell is betting on himself. He's betting that the Steelers will be lost without him. The Steelers are betting they won't be. The problem is that if the Steelers are right and James Conner is good enough to help the team win, saying ""See, we told you so"" doesn't build any good feelings with Bell and his camp. When you're starting a season, is this the kind of tension and drama you want?
7.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	10-6	|	The time for the Jaguars being the off-season darlings is over. It's time for them to put up or shut up. Duval vs. all y'all.
8.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	10-6	|	A middling Atlanta off-season included not much more than signing depth players and retaining current talent. If /u/Jaguargator9's preseason curse doesn't come to fruition, Sarkisian can prove he belongs in the NFL as a play caller, and Matt Ryan can stop throwing butt interceptions, ~~the sky~~ another disappointing loss in another Super Bowl is the limit.
9.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	7-9	|	With a significantly overhauled roster and a new defensive coordinator, it's an interesting time for the Packers. The Bears come to Lambeau with the highest paid defensive player in the league to face the highest paid offensive player. Predictions that the NFCN will be a bloodbath this year will be tested immediately.
10.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	9-7	|	The Cal State Dominguez Hills Chargers FC find themselves in a familiar place when it comes to expectations for the 2018 season. Fans can get excited about the return of future HoFer Antonio Gates, but will he and the Chargers finally put the pieces together for a playoff run?
11.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers |	11-5	|	The Panthers are one of the biggest question marks among the early season contenders. What will Norv Turner's new offense produce as Cam Newton works with DJ Moore and Torrey Smith? And how will the defense fair against the offenses of the NFC South?
12.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	10-6	|	There are a lot of question marks going into the season for the Chiefs.  How will second year starter Patrick Mahomes play?  Will the secondary be as bad as advertised?  Can they survive their early season brutal schedule?  What in the world is wrong with Eric Berry?  Hopefully after Week 1 some questions will be answered, for good or for bad.
13.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	9-7	|	The Titans made a bold move by firing their coach after winning a playoff game at the end of last year. The main question is going to be how quickly the players can mesh with the new defensive and offensive schemes. The biggest area of concern seems to be the learning curve for Marcus Mariota with Matt LaFleur's offense, which can take some time to master.
14.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	4-12	|	Texans fans finally have the chance to attend the Electric Circus this year, as it looks like Watt and Clowney may actually be uninjured and on the same field at the same time. And thankfully it seems our long-running QB drought has ended as fans (and coaches) expect that Watson will definitely *Be Someone* this season, but with only a few games under his belt since his injury, it's too early to crown him the People's Champ because, as everyone knows, it takes grinding to be a king (even for first round draft picks). Will the Texans finally sip the sweet syrup of victory, or will it be another season of double-cupping disappointment? Only time can tell.
15.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	9-7	|	The Lions caught an early wave of hype after the signing of new HC Matt Patricia in February, but most have cooled significantly on them since then. Less than outstanding preseason performances and roster moves by division rivals have certainly overshadowed Detroit. It's important to remember the Lions did aggressively address their biggest weakness this off-season, however, and if there is significant improvement in the run game, it could change everything for this team.
16.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	9-7	|	The biggest story entering the preseason was how first round rookie Lamar Jackson would do. But while he was having rookie growing pains, Joe Flacco had an excellent 16 attempts, and Robert Griffin III earned himself a roster spot as the backup. This high level of preseason play has become customary for the Ravens, with their 5-0 preseason following a couple of 4-0 ones, and increasing their preseason win streak to 13 games.
17.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	6-10	|	Its rare that a 6-10 team enters the season with such high expectations, but that is the result of the season-altering trade for Jimmy Garoppolo. From 1-10 to 5-0, 2017 was a tale of two seasons. All the questions around the Niners boil down to one basic question: Which team will show up in 2018?
18.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	9-7	|	The makeover of the Cowboys over the past two seasons has been disturbingly drastic. Now boasting the youngest roster in the NFC, casual fans will probably struggle to name more than a handful of starters from a roster full of question marks. Committed to building through the draft, this year will serve as first indicator as to whether or not this will be a repeat of the 1989 rebuild, which looks superficially similar.
19.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	5-11	|	The Bears took advantage of their financial flexibility to make a huge splash by trading for Khalil Mack and promptly making him rich. While the Bears are far from in ""win now"" mode, it's clear Pace thinks the young core of this team is good enough to be in serious contention over the next few seasons. With new head coach Matt Nagy at the helm, the Bears could be in store for a surprising, exciting season, even in a stacked NFC North.
20.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	9-7	|	Seattle's certainly going through a changing-of-the-guard, and not just on the offensive line. No one can act like it's no big deal that the defense lost four (maybe five?) superstars over the last 12 months, but the Seahawks have previously shown that superstars can be made out of underrated late draft picks. On one hand, veterans bring stability and knowledge. [On the other hand...](https://i.imgur.com/eDPK5wO.jpg)
21.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins | 	7-9	|	The Redskins go into 2018 with a lot of uncertainty. Nobody quite knows what to expect from Alex Smith and the rest of the offense. Preseason injuries have already quelled what little enthusiasm the fan base had and there still exists a lot of ill will over the mismanagement of talent during the off-season. Simply put, this team needs to win or they may be back to the same old revolving door of coaches and QB's who came to Washington and failed.
22.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	7-9	|	The Bengals, once again, retained Marvin Lewis in the off-season, a move that reinforces Mike Brown's love for the status quo. The Bengals may he slightly improved from last season, but likely not enough to be taken seriously as playoff contenders. Vegas has the win over/under at 6.5.
23.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	5-11	|	With a new quarterback, a revamped backfield, and a defense exchanging one criminal for another, the Denver Broncos look to improve off of their disastrous 5-11 campaign. Bronco Killers Alex Smith and Khalil Mack have gone East—where they can't hurt the Broncos anymore—creating a wide-open AFC West. Can the Broncos get back to the playoffs with Case? Or will the hopes of the mountain rest on $wag? Only time can tell.
24.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	3-13	|	New GM Dave Gettleman won the adoration of fans when he signed Odell Beckham Jr. to a long-term deal in the summer. That adoration, though, will quickly wear off if the Giants get off to a bad start in what's shaping up to be a brutal early season stretch of games. Time will tell if the moves done to address the OL were enough, and if the decision to keep Eli Apple in the starting lineup was a defensible one.
25.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	6-10	|	It is only fitting that the writer of this blurb is over 30 and was picked up off the street last minute. The players are saying the right things after the departure of Khalil Mack, but fans are going into week one feeling a bit like they've just been broken up with. A week one win would do a lot to raise the spirits and restore faith in the new regime.
26.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	8-8	|	Many are counting the Cardinals out before the season begins, and Vegas has them tied for least wins with the Browns, Bills, and Jets. A coaching change, QB change, scheme change, and one of the league's toughest schedules makes some of that understandable, but nearly all the same pieces that made the team 8-8 last year are still intact. An opening home game against Washington should be a good indication of how the season may go.
27.	| [](/IND) | Colts |	4-12	|	After an off-season full of turnover as Colts GM Chris Ballard continues to remake the roster, projections and expectations are a mixed bag for the 2018 Colts. Pending Andrew Luck's continued health and a massive improvement in the coaching department, a 12-4 record and division title could be the ceiling of this young and talented squad. But question marks at WR, RB, and along each level of the defense could mean another top 10 draft pick come season's end.
28.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	6-10	|	It's easy to knock the team that spends the off-season tossing aside 3 Pro-Bowlers and bringing in some old war equipment and a receiver that only plays well during the part of the season that the Dolphins tend to watch from home, but the Dolphins are trying something that teams don't usually do, except for the Patriots: Building a team on players that want to work to win and put in the time during the week and during the off-season to win.  Nobody that hasn't been to the Dolphins camp thinks they have a chance, but oddly, everyone that visits says they have something special.  We'll see.
29.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	5-11	|	The good news is that the Buccaneers exited the NFL preseason with as many ACLs as they had when they started. The bad news is that they're facing a brutal schedule and starting the season without their top quarterback.
30.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 	9-7	|	After a brief 17 year misstep, the Buffalo Bills returned to their standard of excellence last year with a playoff berth in Sean McDermott’s first year as HC. The defense looks to be substantially improved, with the team retaining its elite secondary talent while adding several front seven players this off-season, so the fate of the season now lies in the hands of sophomore QB Nathan Peterman as well as the ability of newcomers at offensive line to step up and perform. A failure at either of these could very well spell disaster, but improvement from last year’s 9-7 record is highly doable if things go well for the Bills in these areas.
31.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	5-11	|	On this week's episode of Hey Darnold!, [Helga Pa-Mac-i](https://i.imgur.com/XRvBKSa.png) left no doubt that the future is now by naming Sam Darnold the week 1 starting QB and sending Teddy Two-Gloves to New Orleans for a 3rd-round pick. What does the season hold? It's all on Sam now. 
32.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	0-16	|	Can we make it all sixteen games with the same quarterback? Can we manage at least four wins? Can we make it all year with our head coach? History says no, but history is stupid. As the saying goes ""those who do not study history are totally OK and things work out great"". Buckle up Browns fans, its 2018!

---

| Winner      |  | Loser          | Comments     |
|:-----------|:-:|:------------|:-------------|
[](/PHI)Eagles|over|[](/ATL)Falcons|Despite the offseason drama with both teams, I need to hearken back to the Divisional Round last season to when these two teams last played each other. And although Philly has lost a lot of key players, they still maintain a great coaching staff which I think will help them get a home opener win.
[](/PIT)Steelers|over|[](/CLE)Browns|I'm tempering my expectations on how good this Browns team could be. My gut is warning me about this pick, but my brain is telling me that Big Ben will put on a show, even if Bell doesn't make it to Week 1.
[](/IND)Colts|over|[](/CIN)Bengals|I think Cincinnati will barely lose this one to the Colts. Having Luck back for a home opener will have the whole place rocking and they'll have just enough firepower to squeak out a win. This one really depends on Luck's performance.
[](/TEN)Titans|over|[](/MIA)Dolphins|Will Mariota outperform Tannehill? I think just barely. I literally took out a coin on this one. Both teams have been pretty quiet during this offseason, so I think this first game will tell us a lot about which way either team is going this year.
[](/MIN)Vikings|over|[](/SF)49ers|I think Garoppolo has better talent than Cousins. But the Vikings have a better overall team. They didn't lose too much since last season, and I think they'll be able to pick up where they left off.
[](/NE)Patriots|over|[](/HOU)Texans|Unless you're an AFC East rival, you're going to pick Brady and the Pats by default in Week 1. It doesn't matter who they lost or gained in free agency, Belichick will find a way. That being said, I'm super excited to see Watson back on the field, and you can never count out how explosive Watt and Clowney are.
[](/NO)Saints|over|[](/TB)Buccaneers|Home opener in the Dome, you can bet Brees is going to have fun on Sunday. Winston will begin the  season serving a 3-game suspension, so it's Fitz-magic in this matchup. On the other side, Ingram will also be suspended. But you'll have the 2017 OROY Kamara taking most of the running snaps, with a good backfield to accompany him.
[](/JAC)Jaguars|over|[](/NYG)Giants|Picking up from the 2017 season, the Jags are the team to beat in the AFC South. With OBJ back, Eli will have his go-to receiver again, but I think won't be enough to beat this very good Jacksonville defense.
[](/BAL)Ravens|over|[](/BUF)Bills|The Ravens are going to be angry in this matchup. Buffalo played a major part in making them sit out in January last season. And Buffalo doesn't seem nearly ready, considering their QB situation still isn't very good (Peterman and a still raw Josh Allen is probably the worst QB duo in football.) Meanwhile, Flacco came off of the preseason on fire and the Ravens are hungry to get revenge.
[](/KC)Chiefs|over|[](/LAC)Chargers|Most likely, unless the Raiders go apeshit, whoever wins this game will probably win the AFC West. It’s been since 2013 since the Chargers have beaten the Chiefs, so I'm sticking with what I know. This will be a good game to watch, and I think a close one. But I'm picking KC on this one.
[](/DEN)Broncos|over|[](/SEA)Seahawks|The Legion of Boom is no more. I don't think Seattle is going to go all the way up to Mile High and coming out with a win this week. Keenum will shine with his new team and bring Denver some wins, starting with this one.
[](/ARI)Cardinals|over|[](/WAS)Redskins|Hey, it's two teams Adrian Peterson has played for in the last year! This looks a lot like the opener last year with the Saints and Vikings. I wonder if we'll see the same result. Speaking of former Vikings, I think Sam Bradford will have a great showing this week.
[](/CAR)Panthers|over|[](/DAL)Cowboys|This should be a great matchup. Prescott will have Elliott back and we should see some great plays from both of them. But even with that, it'll be hard to beat that Carolina defense, and Cam (love him or hate him) is basically a QB/RB combo on his own. I think Carolina barely wins this one.
[](/GB)Packers|over|[](/CHI)Bears|Rodgers got his payday, and he's going to play like it too. I think Trubisky will do well this season, but starting off against the Packers in Lambeau is not a good way of telling that.
[](/DET)Lions|over|[](/NYJ)Jets|Many folks were betting on Bridgewater to guide the Jets to a lot of wins. But now he's a Saint, studying under Drew Brees, so Darnold is the starter. I think Stafford will pull out a close victory in this matchup.
[](/LAR)Rams|over|[](/OAK)Raiders|This one will be a great game to watch. I'm very intrigued to see how good (or bad) the Raiders will do under Gruden. He came at a high cost, and I think they'll be exceptional this season, but not seeing him in action leans me towards the Rams on this matchup, given their performance last season.

Between Josh Allen being young and raw, and their offense having major issues at the skill and OL positions, the Bills aren’t really in the position to “win now”. So they should be all in on the future right?

They have 50 million in cap space next season that they can use to address some of their issues, but i don’t think anyone excepts Allen to take over next year and set the world on fire immediately , so even more assets would be useful for the future than a 31 year old RB. 

Another plus is maybe they could recoup some value that they spent moving up for Allen

831	Predicting First-Time Pro Bowlers	"Due to all the injury and fake ""injury"" replacements, the Pro Bowl distinction doesn't mean as much as has in the past. That said, it still means *something.* It's still a nice honor for NFL players, especially those who play often-anonymous positions.

Looking ahead, here are some players that may earn their first trip this season.

######**transcendent rookies**

**RB Saquon Barkley, N.Y. Giants**

Okay so Barkley is hardly ""anonymous,"" as one of the highest profile rookie running backs in years. In fact, I ranked him as [the greatest running back prospect of the entire 2000s](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/72ky1d/where_does_saquon_barkley_rank_among_the_best_rb/?st=jlnz4oy8&amp;amp;sh=499d1bbb). 

There are some hurdles to overcome in New York -- including an inconsistent offensive line. That said, he's going to get as much work as he can handle. You'd presume Barkley will flirt with 1500 total yards as long as he can stay healthy, which will put him firmly in the Pro Bowl mix.

**OG Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis**

Similarly, # 6 pick Quenton Nelson is one of the [greatest prospects at his position](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8269ar/where_does_quenton_nelson_rank_among_the_best/) in the past several decades. That speaks to his skill set, but also gives him an immediate reputation and a high profile. For most guards, it takes years to earn yourself Pro Bowl recognition. Nelson will be under that spotlight right away. Based on his resume, you presume he'll deliver on that opportunity.

######**super sophomores**

**DE Myles Garrett, Cleveland**

The easiest pick on the board, Myles Garrett is not only a Pro Bowl candidate -- he's a Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Let's not waste much time on this one.

**DT Jonathan Allen, Washington**

After arriving with a great resume at Alabama, Jonathan Allen appeared to be one of the most ""pro ready"" rookies in his class. He played fairly well (78.2 grade on PFF) before an injury derailed his rookie season after only 5 games. 

Now that he's back and joined up with fellow Alabama DL Da'Ron Payne, Allen and the Redskins defense have the opportunity to take a major step up this year. It's never easy for linemen like Allen to rack up gaudy stats, so the 'Skins team success may be vital for him to stay on the national radar.

Meanwhile, I'd list Allen's college teammate Reuben Foster as a similar first time Pro Bowler himself, if not for a 2 game suspension to start the year. In fact, Foster is *so* good that he may get it anyway.

**DB Jamal Adams, N.Y. Jets**

Like Jon Allen, Jamal Adams had been seen as the ""can't miss"" prospect of his class. He immediately became the face of the Jets' defense. Adams had a strong debut (63 tackles, 3 sacks) but to take that next step, he'll need to increase his turnovers (0 interceptions). Even if he doesn't, I suspect Adams will rack up 100 tackles and maintain the type of profile that will keep him in consideration.

**CB Desmond King, L.A. Chargers**

A mere R5 pick, Desmond King stands in contrast to our other bluechip talents. At least, in terms of pedigree. In terms of actual football skill? The kid is elite. He was a four-year starter at Iowa who translated that success to the Chargers immediately, racking up a PFF grade of 85.7, 8th best among all cornerbacks.

For an unheralded talent like King, team success is important in terms of elevating his profile. He should find that with the Chargers. Personally, I ranked them as the [best team in the NFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/9btrpp/2_x_32_minute_drill_complete_preseason_rankings/?st=jlnzkwl2&amp;amp;sh=55ca6202), largely on the strength of their defense. In fact, the team could have as many as SIX Pro Bowlers on defense alone. Three of those are likely -- bookends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, as well as CB Casey Hayward. But Desmond King, LB Denzel Perryman (a sturdy run stuffer), and rookie safety Derwin James are all darkhorses themselves.

**RB Joe Mixon, Cincinnati**

An electric talent out of Oklahoma, Joe Mixon didn't exactly light the world on fire as a rookie. That said, he was playing behind a raggedy ass offensive line in Cincinnati. If the Bengals' additions this offseason (including LT Cordy Glenn and rookie C Billy Price) can help settle that unit, Mixon should benefit in a major way. He's an explosive back who can also be a fluid receiver out of the backfield. 

######**breakthrough vets**

**OG Shaq Mason, New England**

Quite frankly, I'm surprised Shaq Mason wasn't a Pro Bowler *last* season. The 25 year old graded as the 4th best guard on PFF, and plays for a team that has a large national profile. If he follows that up with a similar year, he should be a lock. 

**DE Chris Jones, Kansas City**

Like Shaq Mason, Chris Jones probably deserved to make the Pro Bowl last season. He had 6 sacks as an end in a 3-4 (not easy to do), and graded a 89.7 on PFF's scale, 7th best for his position.

The challenge for players like Jones (and Jonathan Allen) is that their positions don't lend themselves to stats. That said, sites like PFF really do help boost their public profile among savvier voters. If Jones can keep improving his play into that elite territory, he'll be hard to ignore for long.

**FS Lamarcus Joyner, L.A. Rams**

If not for an injury, Lamarcus Joyner may have made this list himself. He's a little spark plug and natural playmaker for the position, frequently making splash plays all over the field. PFF graded him at 90.9, the 2nd highest ranking for his position last year.

At 27 and soon to be 28, Joyner's finally ready for his breakout moment and spotlight. Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh should supply the pressure up front, allowing Joyner to benefit with some big plays on the back end.

**WR Marvin Jones, Detroit**

This one is more of a projection than certainty, but I'm high on the chances for Marvin Jones to break out this season. He was seen as a solid # 3 WR in Cincinnati, and now a solid # 2 in Detroit. But my question is: what if he's even better than that?

The stats would tend to suggest as much. Last season, the 28-year-old Jones logged 1101 yards and 9 touchdowns -- on only 108 total targets. That rate (10.2 yards per target) is an elite number. And it's not a total fluke either. He had registered 7.9 and 9.0 the prior two seasons. 

Marvin Jones is part of an evenly balanced receiving core (and tends to play more of the deep threat role), but there should be plenty of passes to go around this year. I anticipate Matt Stafford zipping the ball all over the field this season, and perhaps leading the league in passing yardage. If 120 or 130 of those targets go to Marvin Jones, he'll put up the type of numbers that can lead to his first Pro Bowl trip.

If Mack lined up opposite the left tackle, the tight end would shift left. The Saints called it “Mack Protection” in the gameplan that week.

A lot of falcons fans complained that if Julio wanted more money, he should have more tds and dez signed a big contract he wasn’t performing too. So why not just sign a contract that is based on how you perform based on your stat average leading up to the negotiation?

Ex. Say Julio is getting his new contract in 2018, say he gets a base of 14 mil a year, over 5 years and half is fully guaranteed

Say a clause in the contract says he must hit these numbers which happen to be his career averages

84 catches 
1300 yards
6 tds


Once he hits all those he gets extra money per milestone. That way he gets his money as long as he performs, and if he doesn’t, the front office doesn’t have to pay all that dough for no production, a la dez bryant.

I don’t know how money games you have to play  in order to have considered playing the season, but if your injured and miss the year, you get that year fully guaranteed, but with no bonuses.

* Vikings
* Eagles

**Tier 2: Teams that can win a SB or get KO'd in the wildcard of the playoffs. Not winning the division or deep run would be a letdown:**

* GB
* PIT
* NO
* LAR
* ATL
* CAR
* JAX


**Tier 3: Teams that can make the playoffs or have a losing record. A deep playoff run would be a surprise. This is where the majority of teams are imo:**

* KC
* LAC
* OAK
* HOU
* TEN
* BAL
* DAL
* WAS
* DET
* SEA
* SF

**Tier 4: Teams that can have a big jump in play due to offseason moves and come out of nowhere to be good. These are the high ceiling and low floor teams:**

* CHI
* IND
* CIN
* NYG
* ARI


**Tier 5: Teams that are not expected to make the playoffs and you wouldn't be surprised if they had a losing season:**

* DEN
* CLE
* BUF
* MIA
* NYJ
* TB

919	I often hear Tom Brady takes a huge paycut for the Pats, how true is this actually?	Just wondering, in light of the Rodgers contract I've heard how Brady takes a huge paycut for the Pats and I'm curious how much truth there is to this.  I feel like I hear about it every now and then and sometimes I read stories that it's not actually that true that restructures his contract to shift money around but his actual pay per year is in line with his production, and I'm curious what the truth is. If he really is playing well under market value for an MVP caliber player, then IMO it seems like it demystifies some of the Pats mystique and makes it a lot easier to understand how they're so freaking good ever year. We often talk about how teams have a window with a great QB on a rookie deal, so I'm curious if the Pats have had that with the added benefit that their QB happens to be the GOAT/ 	nfl

968	[OC] How the NFL's trend to 2 QBs may be to the XFL's benefit	"As we've all noticed over the last few weeks, the NFL is continuing a league-wide trend towards two quarterbacks (rather than the old standard of three.) 

There are a few reasons for this, of course. For one, teams have started to realize the importance of keeping their players fresh by using them in rotations -- especially along the defensive line. Those roster spots, often ""wasted"" on a 3rd QB that doesn't play, can be better utilized elsewhere.

Secondly, there's a sober realization that if you *are* down to your 3rd quarterback, chances are that you're in trouble regardless. A backup may be able to keep you afloat (or win you the Super Bowl, apparently) but a 3rd QB who gets limited reps will have a hard time keeping the team competitive. 

This trend may actually benefit side leagues like the XFL (allegedly starting again in 2020) or the proposed AAU (Alliance of American Football.) While Vince McMahon may believe he can capture a market by cool camera angles and more violence, the key to garnering interest has always been, and will always be, the QB position. Fans here on reddit may take about the Khalil Mack trade or the Jalen Ramsey comments, but they don't move the needle for casual fans who only know the stars.

Obviously, the XFL (or AAF) won't be able to land the Tom Bradys or Aaron Rodgers of the world. Trying to out-bid the NFL for them (like the UFL attempted to do in the 80s) will only lead to bankruptcy.

However, these smaller leagues have an opportunity ahead of them: **become a developmental league** for players who aren't getting that time and attention in the NFL. Well-trained offensive linemen are in the highest demand, but there's also a niche market for younger quarterbacks who need time to adjust to the ""pro"" game.

The NFL has the time and patience for young and raw quarterbacks that they deem franchise worthy talents (like a Blake Bortles or Mitchell Trubisky), but if you're *not* seen as the future starter, you're out of luck. Among the fringe young bucks who have found themselves on the unemployment line recently include: Davis Webb (R3 pick in 2017), Cardale Jones (R4 pick in 2016), Christian Hackenberg (R2 pick in 2016), and Paxton Lynch (R1 pick in 2016). 

In the NFL, you're either...

a) the future (or present) starter

b) a competent backup

c) or you're out.

Those trimmed down rosters are creating a larger supply of quarterbacks, with less demand for their services. Quarterbacks like these could funnel into side leagues like the XFL or AAF and attempt to develop their habits with real pro coaches. All the players mentioned are 25 or younger; they still have upside in the tank. 

Will they actually develop that? Probably not. But possibly. And if that happens -- if say, Davis Webb turns out to the league MVP of the XFL in a couple of years -- then they're going to start acquiring newfound interest from the ""big boys"" again. Fans of teams in need of QBs will be scouring college first and foremost, but also keeping an eye on the fringe leagues to see if a star may emerge. It's not unheard of either: Warren Moon, Doug Flutie, and Kurt Warner all thrived in different leagues before becoming good starters in the NFL.

In my mind, developing young QBs like that is the best path forward for the relevance of these side leagues. There may be some temptation to chase a ""Big Three"" model, where NBA wash-outs are playing 3-on-3 and actually doing decent ratings on Fox Sports. Perhaps there's some opportunity there to go for the ""biggest name"" and try to pay some big name retired player like Kurt Warner a few million to captain a team. In my opinion, that's a gimmick that won't last over the long haul. 

Perhaps there's a compromise between the two where the XFL chases big college stars who *still* have some youth and NFL potential (like Johnny Manziel, or Robert Griffin III if he ended up cutting cut at some point), but the key would still be signing players with some actual chance of becoming an NFL player again. 

Football fans crave the sport, the more the better, but the more the XFL or AAF can do to serve a viable function (as opposed to becoming a side show), the more sustainability and utility they'll have."	nfl

974	OC: Can you pay top dollar for 2 players and Contend?	"So after the Mack trade, I have heard a lot of ""you can't tie up that much salary between 2 players and be successful"". I was curious if this was true, so I pulled the Salary Cap (SC) data for the last 3 years and the teams that made the playoffs. I chose playoff teams because, when it comes to winning the Super Bowl, and the NFL playoff system, there is too much luck involved.

First part I will look at are the teams that made the playoffs in 2015, 2016, AND 2017. Those teams are New England, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City.

The average salary cap % for the two largest contracts on each team by year:

**New England:**

2015- 15.7%

2016- 15.1%

2017- 15%

Average 15.3%

**Pittsburgh:**

2015- 18.4%

2016- 24.8%

2017- 18.8%

Average 20.7%

**Kansas City:**

2015- 16.4%

2016- 19.6%

2017- 22.9%

Average 19.6%

Three teams have made the playoffs in each of the years looked at. Kansas City and Pittsburgh have both gotten close to 20% of salary cap being shared between two players. New England is an anomaly, and has the best QB of all time playing at a discounted rate. It is hard to gauge how the team would be built if Brady received his true market value. The thing that these teams have in common is that they all had veteran QB's that are arguably top 10. Most likely the Green Bay Packers would have been part of this list if Rodgers had stayed healthy last year. 

The list is also littered with teams that have high salary cap usage between two players, as well as having the benefit of having a top 15 QB on a rookie contract (Seattle, Rams, Tennessee, Houston, Philly, Oakland, Minnesota, and Carolina).

The teams that had the highest SC % usage were:

2015 Denver - 20.5%

2015 Carolina - 22.1%

2015 Green Bay - 20.4%

2016 Pittsburgh - 24.8%

2016 Dallas - 21.2%

2016 Atlanta - 25%

2016 Seattle - 21.6%

2016 Green Bay - 20.2%

2016 New York G - 22.2%

2016 Detroit - 22.5%

2017 Kansas City - 22.9%

2017 Atlanta - 22.4%

12/36 playoff teams had a SC % Usage of over 20% for their top 2 paid players.

After looking at everything, I don't see how this can be a blanket statement that is used as an excuse to not sign a top player. Mack and Carr would have averaged 21% of their teams cap % for 2018-2021 (using Mack's Chicago contact). This % could be lower, but since negotiations never happened between Oakland and Mack, we don't know the exact figures of a contract that he would have sought. 

What we do know is that Oakland has struggled to bring in additional talent around Carr and Mack on both sides of the ball, since they have been drafted. Cooper and Crabtree have been the only two consistent offensive weapons. And defensively not many have stood out. This is due to poor drafting, giving contracts to Free Agents that haven't panned out, and some bad luck. Carr is a top 10 QB, and it would be more evident if they had a defense that would allow Carr to play with a lead. And when the Raiders do have a lead, a running game that could help manage the clock.

There is more than one way to build a team to make the playoffs and sustain long-term success. Very few teams ever figure it out, which is why dynasties are rare. Giving up known, high-caliber, talent isn't the best way to do it. You can't blame the players for earning big contracts. You have to put the blame on management for not finding the right players to fit a team. Year in and year out Green Bay, New England, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, etc. find ways to build their team to get to the playoffs. There isn't one formula, and there is a ton of risk.

At the end of the day, I think Oakland made a mistake, and I am glad Chicago was able to capitalize. Maybe they suck, maybe they get to the crapshoot that is the playoffs and make a run within the next 4 years. They took the risk. Oakland is taking a risk and they are going to try and find another defensive anchor in the draft. I believe in throwing good money at a known quantity versus gambling in the draft.

Also more specialists could be on teams, instead of relying on one guy who’s a jack of all traits to back up multiple positions, they could go for things like a specialist pass rusher. 

teams could truly try to build the best team and not have to make a decision over having a backup or not for say center. 

I’m sure there are plenty of reasons for and against and I would love to hear them.

986	How true is the Rodgers' criticism for taking too many sacks? Over the past 3 years, Rodgers' is 5th in passer rating (sacks not calculated), but 13th in ANY/A right next to Derek Carr (takes sacks into account). Over that span, he's 5th in sacks taken per game among 30 qualified QBs.	Just thought it was shocking how low Rodgers was in ANY/A given the amount of support he has as the best QB going into next season.  He had a big down year in 2015, and although Lacy regressed hard, and Jordy was injured with Adams not playing at the level he is at right now, he also had a line of Bakhtiari/Sitton/Linsley/Lang/Bulaga, which is ridiculous, and his defense wasn't bad.  Then 2016 he bounced back, but wasn't quite elite, still in that great tier, and then this past tier, he got injured, but wasn't phenomenal either, even before the injury, still in that good-great area.  I think it's interesting  to think if he can get back into that truly elite, All-Pro area this upcoming year with Adams looking much better, Graham added, and a souped up defense (though his interior line was stripped), or if he'll stick around in that 3-5 area of great, but not elite QBs.	nfl

988	NFL 2010s All-Decade Team predictions	"In case you didn't know, there is an ""All-Decade Team"" selected by the members of the HoF at the end of each decade. Because there is only 2 seasons remaining, it is mostly possible to already predict who is going to be in the First Team and the Second Team.

I based my choices on the following criteria :

* Longetivity (Going through injuries, not missing games)
* Awards (All-Pro selections, Pro Bowls, MVPs, OPOYs, DPOYs)
* Statistical production
* Pro Football Focus Grades
* Consistency

Keep in mind that is list isn't just based on past 8 seasons, but also based on who I predict can still play at a high level in the next two seasons.

1001	The last player to be traded for two first round draft picks before Mack was Jay Cutler, here's what happened to all the picks in the infamous trade	"Before the 2009 season, after not meshing with head coach Josh McDaniels, the Broncos traded Jay Cutler and Seattle's 2009 5th to the Bears for the Bears' 2009 1st, 2009 3rd, and 2010 1st. The story of these picks is actually pretty dang interesting!

##Seahawks' 2009 5th

The only pick sent to the Bears from the Broncos, the Broncos got the pick by trading receiver Keary Colbert to the Seahawks. Colbert didn't even last all of 2008 with the Seahawks. The pick ended up being 140.

**[](/CHI) Chicago Bears Select, 140th Overall**: Johnny Knox, WR, Abilene Christian 

Knox made the Pro Bowl his rookie year in 2009 and was one of the team's leading receivers in their 2010 run to the NFC Championship Game. However, in 2011 he suffered a severe spinal cord injury and never played again.

##Bears' 2009 1st

This pick was straightforward, traded to the Broncos. It ended up being the 18th overall.

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 18th Overall**: Robert Ayers, DE, Tennessee

Ayers was a disappointment as a first round pick, but was a decent player for a few years. He played with the Broncos through 2013, when they won the AFC Championship. Ayers played for the Giants in 2014 and 2015, then the Buccaneers in 2016 and 2017 before retiring.

##Bears' 2009 3rd

The Bears' 2009 3rd was then traded to the Steelers for the Broncos' 2009 3rd, for the Steelers' 2009 2nd and 4th. The Steelers' 2nd ended up being 64th overall, the Broncos' 3rd 79th overall, the Bears' 3rd 84th overall, and the Steelers' 2nd 132nd overall.

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 64th Overall**: Richard Quinn, TE, North Carolina

**[](/PIT) Pittsburgh Steelers Select, 79th Overall**: Kraig Urbik, G, Wisconsin

**[](/PIT) Pittsburgh Steelers Select, 84th Overall**: Mike Wallace, WR, Ole Miss

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 132nd Overall**: Seth Olsen, OT, Iowa

Easily the best player from this bunch is Mike Wallace, the only player still in the league. None of the other players spent more than two years with the team that drafted them. Wallace had a touchdown in the Steelers' loss in Super Bowl XLV.

##Bears' 2010 1st

And here is where it gets *crazy*. A lot of the teams in these trades would make the Super Bowl this decade.

The Broncos traded the Bears' 2010 1st for the 49ers' 2010 1st, and the 49ers' 2010 4th.

**[](/SF) San Francisco 49ers Select, 11th Overall**: Anthony Davis, OT, Rutgers

Davis played four years in San Francisco, starting for them in Super Bowl XLVII. Remember the 49ers 4th for a minute.

The Broncos then traded the 49ers' 2010 1st for the Eagles' 2010 1st, the Seahawks' 2010 3rd, and the Eagles' 2010 3rd. I'm not going to go into how the Eagles had the Seahawks' pick, but just roll with it.

Then, Baltimore traded the Ravens' 2010 1st for the Dolphins' 2010 2nd (the Broncos had it), Seahawks' 2010 3rd, and the Broncos' 2010 4th. Okay, more players!

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 25th Overall**: Tim Tebow, QB, Florida

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 43rd Overall**: Sergio Kindle, LB, Texas

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 70th Overall**: Ed Dickson, TE, Oregon

**[](/BAL) Baltimore Ravens Select, 114th Overall**: Dennis Pitta, TE, BYU

Yes, Tebow. Now the most notable players are the two TEs selected by the Ravens who both won Super Bowl XLVII. Dickson is still in the league on the Seahawks.

Okay, then with the Eagles' 2010 3rd...

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 87th Overall**: Eric Decker, WR, Minnesota

Decker just retired after eight years as a wide receiver in the league, being part of the Broncos' record breaking AFC Championship winning offense in 2013.

Now, with the 49ers' 2010 1st, the Eagles took...

**[](/PHI) Philadelphia Eagles Select, 13th Overall**: Brandon Graham, DE, Michigan

This was a great pick, Graham is still on the Eagles and proud owner of a snazzy Super Bowl LII ring.

The Broncos traded the Eagles' 2010 1st and 49ers 2010 4th with the Patriots for the Patriots' 2010 1st. 

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 113th Overall**: Aaron Hernandez, TE, Florida

Yep.

The Patriots traded the Eagles' 2010 1st and Patriots' 2010 4th to the Cowboys for the Cowboys' 2010 1st, and Cowboys' 2010 3rd.

**[](/DAL) Dallas Cowboys Select, 24th Overall**: Dez Bryant, WR, Oklahoma State

Good pick, Dez was a great player. The Cowboys traded the Patriots' 2010 4th and look, that got traded to Miami, and whatever.

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 27th Overall**: Devin McCourty, S, Rutgers

**[](/NE) New England Patriots Select, 90th Overall**: Taylor Price, WR, Ohio

Price flamed out of the league, playing most of his career in Jacksonville. McCourty is now a veteran on the Patriots, and Super Bowl XLIX and LI champion.

Okay, so that leaves one last pick, the Patriots' 2010 1st in the hands of the Broncos

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 22nd Overall**: Demaryius Thomas, WR, Georgia Tech!

WON THE TRADE. Thomas is the last member of the legendary 2013 Broncos offense, Super Bowl 50 champion, and all around cool guy.

##The Finale

So, here's what the Bears got:

**Traded to [](/CHI) Chicago Bears**: Jay Cutler, QB

**[](/CHI) Chicago Bears Select, 140th Overall**: Johnny Knox, WR, Abilene Christian 

Here's what the Broncos ended up getting:

**Traded to [](/DEN) Denver Broncos**: Kyle Orton, QB

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 18th Overall**: Robert Ayers, DE, Tennessee

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 64th Overall**: Richard Quinn, TE, North Carolina

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 132nd Overall**: Seth Olsen, OT, Iowa

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 25th Overall**: Tim Tebow, QB, Florida

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 87th Overall**: Eric Decker, WR, Minnesota

**[](/DEN) Denver Broncos Select, 22nd Overall**: Demaryius Thomas, WR, Georgia Tech

I know everyone is buzzing as the new season is starting and so am I. However, as a student doing a research of playing time distributions in North American sports leagues, I have a noobish question due to my unfamiliarity towards the sport, which I’m sure is easy for many of you to answer.

To my surprise, in football there is no ”minutes played” or ”time on field” stat to be found for each player of a team. Thus I wonder if there is any way to figure out how playing times are distributed between players in their respective defensive and offensive lineups in football? All suggestions are appreciated.

Thank you in advance!"	nfl

The 2018 playoffs were absolutely incredible, pretty much every game was a tense nail biter, with one or two exceptions (NFC Championship especially).

2013 playoffs. Notable games: 49ers vs Falcons, Ravens vs Broncos, Falcons vs Seahawks, and the Super Bowl between the Ravens and 49ers was definitely one of the better Super Bowls the NFL has had."	nfl

1081	What’s Peyton Manning’s argument over Aaron Rodgers all time?	"Skill wise/talent wise Rodgers is Manning’s superior. He’s more accurate more mobile and he takes much better care of the ball. He has a much stronger arm and is more athletic 

Stat wise on agame to game season to season basis Rodgers also has the edge. Now Manning has more bulk stats but Rodgers will surpass those in time

Manning has played with significantly better skill position talent and overall team talent. 

Team success is where Manning has the edge. But it’s not like Brady who blows him and every body really except Otto graham out of the water. Arod was 1 title/ SB appearance while Manning has two titles and 4 appearances.  But arod has one of the greatest playoff runs in history in his Super Bowl title run while manning sucked in both of his championship runs. The first one he had a 70 passer rating with 3 tds to 7 picks while the second he was carried by a top 20 defense in history.  

Generally Rodgers has been better in the playoffs and his teams haven’t been as big a disappointment. The packers have only loss one time as a favorite, and that was to the giants. The colts/Broncos made that a yearly routine 

Both their teams being crap when they got hurt."	nfl

1112	Why do old QBs seem to fall off a cliff?	"With most other positions it's pretty obvious why players have to retire; as they age their physical skills decline, hits take a toll, and their bodies break down. On the other hand QBs can play into their late 30s and even early 40s and have as much success as they did at their physical peak. In fact QBs actually seem to peak at a time when most RBs are reaching the end of their career (age 28-30). And yet old QBs often seem to all of a sudden fall off a cliff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two example are Brett Favre - at age 40 he had 33 TD, 7 INT, and a 107.2 passer rating, then the next year he had 11 TD, 19 INT, and a 69.9 passer rating. Peyton Manning at age 38 had 35 TD, 15 INT and a 101.5 passer rating, and then the next year he had 9 TD, 17 INT, and a 67.9 passer rating.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do you think this happens? I think it's probably a combination of things. The physical element has an effect - even though not as much as on other players, the decline in skills coupled with years of hits probably takes its toll. QBs are able to overcome this with their mental game, but just as it seems like players get to a point where the game clicks and everything ""slows down,"" there also seems to be a point where the game ""speeds up"" and players can't keep up anymore mentally. So all of a sudden for QBs they have to overcome their declining physical skills but don't have the mental edge to do it. So we see a drastic drop off. 

&amp;#x200B;

1200	The Effects of paying Elite Edge players market value [OC]	"Khalil Mack gets to be this year's edge player to set the market.  Over the last 10 years as the NFL has become pass heavy, elite prospects are considered insanely important.  

But how important are elite pass rushers once they get paid market value?  I looked at all contracts to Edge rushers over the last 10 years that were given top-5 Edge contracts at that time, and here's how the teams did 2 years before &amp; 2 years after handing out that contract:   

|Player|W-L 2 years before|SB either year?|W-L 2 years after|SB either year?

Robert Mathis, IND | 12-21 | N | 23-12 | N    

Of the 22 contracts handed out, 13 of the teams ended up winning more games after signing the player than before.  Overall, teams averaged 0.75 more wins per season after handing out top-5 Edge money   

Interestingly enough, no team in the last 10 years has won a SB within 2 years of paying an Edge rusher the big money.  Only 1 team in the last 10 years ever won a SB again after those big contracts; the 2012 Ravens   

**TLDR** Overall, teams who hand out top-5 Edge contracts have won about 1 more game per season afterwards.   This analysis is simply a starting point and there are tons of factors in building a great team, but I found it interesting and figured you would too

1206	[Rules] Help solve Punt Fumble Debate please	"Team A Punts from the 50.

Team B Punt Returner muffs punt on Team B's 8 Yard line and after muffed contact the ball rolls out of the back of Team B's own end zone. He did not catch the ball fully, for the sake of debate it could've even hit their leg after the ball bounced. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process is possession is flipped on a punt once the ball is touched by the returning team, the ruling is now a safety since the ball rolls out of the endzone.

&amp;#x200B;

Others are saying touchback b/c the returner didn't possess the football, but on a punt doesn't a touch initiate the possession change?

1251	I read about the NFL's 'disaster draft' procedures today. Both interesting and a little disturbing	"&gt; National Football League
The National Football League (NFL)'s contingency plan provides for both a ""near-disaster"" and a ""disaster"". A ""near-disaster"" is defined as fewer than 15 players on a team being disabled, and a ""disaster"" is 15 or more.

&gt; No special draft would be held for a ""near-disaster""; the team would instead get preferential rights on any waivers until the end of the season. If a quarterback is among the fewer than 15 lost, the team would be able to draft up to two quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each team would be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.

&gt; For a ""disaster"", the commissioner would determine whether to cancel the team's schedule for the season. If the team's season is canceled, the team would have the first pick in the next regular draft; a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players. If not canceled, the ""near-disaster"" procedures would be used."	nfl

Cedric Benson, Cadillac Williams, Darren McFadden were all high pickers that never panned out either. Also, let's remember that there isn't much of a skill difference between RB's in the early rounds compared to those taken later in the draft. I love Barkley and his amazing potential but nothing's to be guaranteed. Personally to be completely honest - I don't see him being a franchise changer for the Giants. At least not anytime soon.	nfl

Below is an NFL Pick 'Em Excel workbook for 2018. This was originally created for an office league and being that it's Excel it allowed me to manage/update the sheet during my downtime at work. (I'm sure other people work in places where all the good websites are blocked.) The worksheet has been well received the few last years so I thought I'd post it here again in case anyone is looking to use it.

If you're not familiar with it, here's some pictures of it in action, a primer on how to use the sheet, and the dropbox link to download it:

[Hypothetical - Week 1 results from 2017](https://i.imgur.com/L7AYyYo.png)

It's a fairly straight forward workbook.  The first sheet, Picks, has the full schedule already included.  The info it needs from you is the **spreads** you intend to use, the final **score** of each game, and the **pick** for each participant.  If you want to pick straight up winners then you can leave all the spreads blank and it will still function just fine.  All of the times are shown in CST. 

The second sheet houses all of the statistics.  At the top you can enter a range of seasons/weeks for stats you'd like to see.  It's set up for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons. 

The next few pages display the various statistics based on your previous selection.

1368	[OC] Jason Verrett Part 2: Detailing His Injuries &amp; The Mentality Underlying Them	"Hey everyone, this is part 2 of my piece on Jason Verrett where I get into underlying factors of his achilles rupture, the mentality that connects all his injuries, and his career prospects

Here’s [part 1]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/9bavhy/oc_jason_verrett_detailing_his_injuries_and_the/)

The full original is on my sports blog TheInjuryInsight.
____
### B. Underlying factors that weakened the achilles

#### 1 – Over-Use

“Too much, too soon” is one of the most common causes of soft tissue injury in general, including for the achilles. If there’s a sudden ramp up or overall increase in activity, the tendon gets overloaded with stress and weakens.

By all accounts, the Chargers were being very conservative with Jason Verrett in his recovery but it’s still possible that the extent or intensity of training ramped up too quickly.   That’s especially tangible with a player like Jason Verrett who isn’t one to just do things half-heartedly.

Chargers GM Tom Velesco echoed that sentiment:

&gt; “He was healthy in the offseason program and we were probably more cautious than we had to be. We probably held him back, and he probably wanted to do a lot more. We tried to gently ramp him up, just on volume. But he’s a competitive player.”

&gt;  

&gt; “He’s full go. He wants to be full go.”

In my experience with athletes, one of the toughest challenges is reigning in their intensity and activity level as they recover from injury. Most have been taught to always train at 100%, no matter what.  This mentality sets you up for a setback and risk of new or re-injury.

#### 2 – Fatigue

[Multiple studies have linked fatigue to increasing the risk of achilles tear.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3752187/)

For Jason Verrett, the months leading up his achilles rupture were the highest level of activity that he’d had for years.  After tearing his ACL the first time, he didn’t participate much in summer OTAs or training camp because he was still coming along slowly.  Then after the second ACL tear, he was again in rehab.  He was finally cleared for full practices in mid-June and was working really hard – think back to those earlier quotes from cornerbacks coach Ron Milus about Verrett’s speed and burst being back to pre-injury levels.

That speed and burst comes with more energy expenditure and higher fatigue, especially if you aren’t used to doing them for extended periods of time.  For that reason, fatigue could have played a factor in the achilles tendon rupture.

#### 3 – Changed bio-mechanics &amp; compensation following an ACL tear

The unfortunate reality with an ACL tear (or any injury really, but even more so with severe injuries) is that it doesn’t just affect the knee.  It changes the mechanics of that leg and leads to compensations, both physical and mental.

This speaks to how inderdependent the human body is – every body part mutually relies on the others, like links in a chain.  When one is affected, it indirectly affects the others as well.

https://imgur.com/tJdEXe0

As I mentioned earlier, we know an ACL tear [increases the tear risk for the non-injured ACL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27215935)due to compensations and altered mechanics.  Additionally, there are side to side differences in strength, stability, and proprioception (the proprioceptive system is how your brain unconsciously knows where your body parts are in space) between the injured and non-injured leg for [up to 2 years post surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26535266).

These changes can easily result in changed mechanics and compensatory patterns, with other muscles and tendons, like the achilles tendon (the largest tendon in the body), having to take on a greater share of responsibility.  Over time, those muscles and tendons can become overloaded and start to weaken or degenerate (“career burnout”).

We’ll never know if that was the case with Jason Verrett but it’s reasonably possible.  He had 2 straight years of ACL rehab and he and his coaches openly commented on how he didn’t look right, mentally or physically, until the end of the 2nd year of rehab.

If his achilles tendon was taking on more stress throughout that time, it could have weakened and decreased it’s tolerance to load, with that final push-off equating to the straw that broke the camel’s back.

So those are some underlying possibilities for why his achilles tendon couldn’t handle that final push-off during conditioning.  Lets now transition to the recovery, starting with surgery:

## VI. Achilles Tendon Repair

Although there’s still debate as to whether a non-operative (conservative) or operative (surgical) approach is optimal following an achilles rupture (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21969435), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21037028), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=17885221), [here](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achilles-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture/abstract-text/23224384/pubmed), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20802094) for more info), surgery surgery is recommended for athletes (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20824836), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=22802271), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24013347), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=27307495) for more info).

There are multiple types of achilles surgery but the goal is the same: re-connect the tendon and make sure the tension level is similar to where it was pre-injury.

Here’s one example of what surgery may look like (work-safe):

https://imgur.com/dMTMde3

After surgery is complete and the tendon reconnected, Jason Verrett moves onto rehab and recovery…

## VII. Jason Verrett return to play timeline

Research has shown that the [average return to play timeline after achilles rupture is roughly 6 months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=26281836). However, NFL players [have taken about 11 months on average.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993)

That would peg Jason Verret’s return around June 2018.

Normally I’d go into the full details of his rehab but since this piece is already lengthy, I’m going to skip them and refer you to [this piece](https://theinjuryinsight.com/demarcus-cousins-achilles-rupture/) if you’re interested in the deets.  However, I do want to review some overlying macro factors that could influence Jason Verret’s recovery.

### Macro (contextual) factors

#### 1 – Family, team, and social support

Rehabbing from an injury as a professional athlete can be a very lonely place, let alone when you’re doing it for the third year in a row like Jason Verrett

It’s just you and the medical staff (often times the same person) for long periods of time, days on end.  Therefore, it’s really important to stay connected and have a support system to keep the spirits and motivation up.

Even though Verrett has been injured for the majority of his Chargers career, he’s still developed relationships and connections with the team throughout his tenure there.

For example, here’s what Chargers corner Jahleel Addae[ had to say](https://www.chargers.com/news/heartbroken-teammates-react-to-jason-verrett-s-achilles-injury):

&gt; “I saw what he went through to bounce back from his knee. I saw his loyalty and his dedication to the game, his family and to his craft. To see it happen like that in a conditioning test, I love him like a brother, so to see him go down with a freak injury, it’s tough. But we’ll be praying for him and we’ll be out there for him. Jason will bounce back”

Hopefully those bonds will help inflate his sail as he moves through the rehab process.

#### 2 – Resiliency and mindset

Jason Verrett has had a resilient and tough mindset in spades (arguably to the extreme) but again, this is his third major injury in as many years.  That will wear on any player, even the mentally strongest.

We haven’t heard from Jason Verrett himself but here’s how some of his [teammates &amp; coaches responded](https://www.chargers.com/news/heartbroken-teammates-react-to-jason-verrett-s-achilles-injury), starting with Chargers LB Denzell Perryman who spent last year rehabbing with Jason Verrett:

&gt; “I missed half the season last year, and he missed the whole one, and we went through the rehab phase together…to see him go down, it was devastating. It was sad. It was a comeback season for the both of us, so this hurts my heart. But he’s in my prayers and his family is in my prayers. I just wish him a speedy recovery.”

Additionally, there was Keenan Allen who himself has been through a stretch of brutal injuries:

&gt; “I’m very emotional over it. It’s hard to watch him go down like that after he worked so hard to come back this season. I know how tough it is. I’m just sending him prayers.”

Imagine how Verrett feels.

Coming off the back to back ACL repairs and now with the achilles tendon repair, this rehab is going to be the hardest one yet mentally so it’s critical that Verrett is able to maintain that resilient mindset rather than completely give into thoughts of despair and “why me”.

#### 3 – Contract Uncertainty

There’s never a good time for an achilles rupture but this one couldn’t have come at a worse time for Jason Verrett –  he’s in a contract year.

Contract years are especially critical in the NFL because of the non-guaranteed nature of NFL contracts  – you have to show out as much as possible to earn as much guaranteed money as possible.  Being in a contract year while injured naturally creates a lot of uncertainty for Jason Verrett.

Most humans don’t like uncertainty, especially financial uncertainty, and the feelings of “why me” are inherent, especially for Jason Verrett who has worked his entire life to play in the NFL, battled through constant injuries, finally felt like he was on the brink of being healthy…and then had the rug pulled out yet again.

These feelings of doubt and negativity can and will creep into rehab and negatively impact the healing environment if they aren’t dealt with swiftly.

Normally, I’d also be very concerned (considering his “all or nothing, by any means necessary” mentality) that Jason Verret would rush back and try to play this season in order to assuage team’s concerns and land a bigger deal.

However, it’s pretty much impossible for him to make it back this year. Even on the outside chance that the Chargers make the Super Bowl, (don’t @ me Chargers fans), that’s only slightly over 6 months from his injury to February weekend.  Like I said earlier, the [average return to play for NFL players after an achilles rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993) is 11 months.

So those are some macro layers of Jason Verrett’s recovery.  Once he does get back, what can we expect performance wise and for his future prospects?

## VIII. Long-Term Implications of Achilles Tendon Rupture

The long-term implications after an achilles rupture aren’t pretty.

Many studies have followed individuals after achilles rupture and the results don’t paint a rosy picture.  [Although 80% of individuals returned to following an achilles rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5136353/#R22), there’s evidence of long-term changes in muscle strength, endurance, muscle activity, ankle range of motion, and calf atrophy – for up to 10 years after the rupture (click [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Annegret_Muendermann2/publication/224006065_Deficits_10-Years_after_Achilles_Tendon_Repair/links/00b7d5182aecfc06d3000000/Deficits-10-Years-after-Achilles-Tendon-Repair.pdf), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229048), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511694), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26791028) for more info).  In the case of athletes involved in running, bio-mechanical and muscle deficits can persist for up to 4 years after the injury (click [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22282229), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570159), and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17126970) for more info).

Additionally, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14723785) show there’s an increased risk of injuring the other leg as well.  25% of individuals develop knee or achilles issues on the non-surgical leg, with 6% actually rupturing the achilles on the non-surgical leg.

Further, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28644678) has also shed a light on performance effects after the athlete has returned to competitive play.

Of athletes who were able to play at least 2 seasons after returning from the achilles rupture (nearly 57% weren’t able to meet this criteria for a variety of reasons), they participated in significantly fewer games and had significant decreases in secondary measures of longevity and performance metrics after year 1.

HOWEVER, those athletes who were able to play 2 or more years were able to perform at a level commensurate with their non-injured counterparts.

Further, a [study came out last year that specifically looked at NFL players returning from achilles tendon rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742993).  It found that 73% returned to play but on average went on to play a year less than their non-injured counterparts.

In terms of performance, running backs and linebackers took the biggest hit when comparing pre vs post surgery, and linebackers took a significant hit when comparing post-surgery production to non-injured linebackers.

**So here’s the reality for Jason Verrett after suffering an achilles rupture**:  Odds are that his first two years back will be subpar compared to his pre-injury level.  However, if he’s able to make it through those 2 years without a major setback,  he could return to being a high level corner.  Howevr, his previous ACL injuries are a huge confounding variable that could set him back even further.

Additionally, there’s one other variable that has worked against him throughout his NFL career…

## IX.  The “Grit and Bear It” Mindset

I’ve been dropping not so subtle hints about Jason Verrett’s mindset the entire way:

https://imgur.com/oi34UmW

Unfortunately, this mentality is still pervasive in sports (amongst coaches, players, and fans alike), especially in football (a recent prominent example is the [University of Maryland football coaching staff](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/sports/ncaafootball/maryland-suspends-dj-durkin.html)).  This mindset can lead to and/or exacerbate injuries and in the case of Maryland, [a player actually died](http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/24343021/jordan-mcnair-maryland-terrapins-died-heatstroke-team-workout).

It’s a common theme we saw from Jason Verrett with nearly every injury:

- Playing through an torn right labrum his senior year at TCU (which is actually the most understandable in my opinion because he was playing to get drafted)
- Trying to play through and get a cortisone shot with his injured left labrum and torn rotator cuff during his rookie year in SD
- Chalking up his partial ACL tear as just “normal soreness”
- Going all out during summer practices in the lead-up to his achilles rupture

This mindset of “just keep playing and giving it 100%, no matter what” is commendable to an extent but can quickly become a doubled edged sword.  Two other examples come to mind:

1. Kobe, in the lead-up to his own achilles rupture, severely sprained his ankle against the Hawks when Dahntay Jones undercut him on the final shot of the game (the Zaza school of defense). He came back from that injury way too quickly and went on to play multiple games without rest in order to get the team to the playoffs…until his achilles ruptured in the 3rd to last game of the season (I was at the game unfortunately). https://i.imgur.com/LJQ7jJs.png
2. Isiah Thomas played through a hip labrum tear to lead the Celtics deep into the playoffs (all the while dealing with his little sister’s sudden death.  The amount of flack he got this past year was ridiculous).  He was promptly rewarded by the Celtics by getting dealt to Cleveland where he tried to play himself back into game shape on the floor.  After a mid-season trade to the Lakers, his hip labrum eventually got irritated to the point that he had to shut it down and have surgery…in his contract year.  Instead of a potential max offer in free agency, [he got a 1 year, 2 million (vet minimum) “prove it” deal from Denver](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24081526/isaiah-thomas-agrees-1-year-deal-denver-nuggets).

It’s one thing to try and help the team by making plays, but it’s another thing to be overly reckless, be constantly putting yourself in high risk positions, and playing through constant pain.

I like to use the analogy of hearing a little rattle in your car.

You’re driving along and one day you hear a faint rattle in your car and instead of checking it out, tell yourself “ah it’s nothing, I’m sure it will just go away”. When the rattle gets louder, still “no big deal, the car is just getting older”.  Next thing you know, you go to hit third gear on the highway and your transmission falls out.  That person you shake your head at and give advice to while they’re stranded on the shoulder of the highway is now you.

This mentality is especially risky in the NFL – a sport without guaranteed contracts where most of the teams won’t think twice about cutting an injured player (it’s just business remember? Except when the player decides to make a decision for themselves…then it’s selfish, disloyal, traitorous, etc.  Oy vey).

All that being said, I don’t blame Jason Verrett for this underlying mentality – it’s apparent that football culture still prides itself on a “no pain, no gain, just suck it up and play” mentality.  You constantly hear coaches, commentators, and fans praising that attitude so it’s only natural that players are going to absorb that mentality as well.

You’d think that NFL medical staffs would step in but unfortunately these staffs aren’t independent which lends itself towards bias and feeling pressure to do what’s best for the team rather than the individual.

Verrett’s case certainly takes that mentality to the extreme and it hasn’t helped his career prospects by any means.

## X. All in All

Overall, an achilles rupture is a brutal injury – regardless of when it happens or who suffers it.

It could be especially devastating for Jason Verrett because it’s the third consecutive serious injury to his lower body and another extended rehab period.  That takes a toll physically and mentally, which is further compounded by a murky contract situation and overzealous, ambitious, “go 100% all the time” mindset

If Jason Verrett does get back to full health and is able to stay healthy, it very well may take him 2+ years to get back to his original form and his career is likely to be shorter than other cornerbacks.

I wish Jason Verrett all the best and I try to stay as optimistic as possible in writing these pieces but lets look at this objectively:

A player who plays with reckless abandon and doesn’t listen to his own body (reinforced by the culture of the league he plays in), coming off 3 straight very serious lower body injuries, each with short and long-term ramifications.  It’s hard not to be pessimistic.

Thanks for reading, until next time.  Feel free leave comments or ask questions like always.

1380	Antonio Brown has been Amazing. He only needs to do this for 6 more years until he is 35 to keep pace with Jerry Rice.	Jerry Rice had 1200 yds and/or double digit TDs every year from age 24-34. Its insane with how good Brown is to think Rice was doing this for 11 straight years in an era that favored rushing and didn't protect the QBs and WRs the way we see it now. He avg. 1100yd/8tds his 39/40 yo seasons...incredible.	nfl

1387	Evaluating the NFC North after the Mack trade to the Bears	As a Lions fan I wasn't sure how this division was gonna shape up. The Vikings are clearly the best team in the division after the Cousins deal. I have been drinking the Kool-Aid on Matt Patricia and a possible competent running game during the off season. I felt there wasn't much separating the Lions and Packers and knew the Bears would be better and an up and coming team. Now, I can't say for certain how the rest of the division shapes up. What are your predictions or thoughts on the NFC North for the up coming season?	nfl

1389	Broncos Cut LB Zaire Anderson		nfl
1390	Who do you think will be the worst team this year?	"Since there is a ton of hype for the Browns and Giants. The Broncos look like they have improved, And the Texans are healthy

Who do you think will be the worst team this year?

My bet is on the Bills since they may has the least talented skill player core with a rookie QB.

1392	Serious: Mark Davis couldn’t financially afford to pay Mack?	I have seen this floated around on multiple platforms, is there any truth to this rumor? How can an NFL owner be so cash strapped? Is he paying for Vegas out of his own pocket or something?	nfl
1393	[Adam Schefter] Over next two days, 1,184 NFL players will be fired from their jobs. Some will return to practice squads, but many will have no choice but to move on. There is no busier transactional time in the NFL than this weekend. For many it is a brutal weekend they won’t forget.		nfl

1398	[Trotter] Can’t believe the Raiders would be crazy enough to seriously consider trading Mack, but I’m hearing offers are coming in and they’re weighing them. Strange considering people in org call Mack their best player. Not best defensive player. But player. Period.		nfl
1399	The cuts begin early, as the #Bills are parting ways with LB Tanner Vallejo, source said. They took him in the 6th round last year.		nfl
